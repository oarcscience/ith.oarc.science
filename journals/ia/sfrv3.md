<td>The light of God illumes the light of sense,<br />
And then the soul aspires to meet its God;<br />
A steed without a rider knows no way,<br />
It wants a king to know the royal road.<br />
Behold the sense which governed is by light,<br />
A fine companion is this light to sense.<br />
God's light adorns the sensual light,<br />
This is the meaning of <em>Light on light</em>.<span id="page_64_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_64_note_*">*</a><br />
Light physical drags down to earth beneath,<br />
But light divine exalts to heavenly bliss.<br />
All things of senses in a base world are,<br />
God's light an ocean is, but sense a drop of dew.<br />
Although this motor cannot be perceived,<br />
Unless in virtuous effects and in speech.<br />
The sensual light is ponderous, inert,<br />
Concealed within the eye's recess.<br />
As you the sensual eye-light cannot see,<br />
How find you light which is not of the eye?<br />
This world is swayed like chaff by the unseen wind,<br />
Obeying helplessly the grace of God,<br />
Which now conveys this chaff to sea and now to land;<br />
Sometimes it moistened is and sometimes dry;<br />
The hand unseen is; but see the writing pen!<br />
The horse gallops, no rider does appear,<br />
In mountains now it roams, and now in vales,<br />
It now exalted is and now abased,<br />
It now drives to the right and now to left,<br />
Is now in rose-groves, now in thorny paths.<br />
Behold, the arrow flies without a bow!<br />
Life can be seen, but where is Life of life?<br />
Break not the shaft, it is a royal one,<br />
Although its nullity the mover knows;<br />
God said: <em>thou hast not cast it, but I cast</em>.<span id="page_64_fr_dagger"></span><a href="#page_64_note_dagger">†</a><br />
The acts of God precede all other acts,<br />
You must your anger break and not the shaft,<br />
Your wrathful eye turns milk to blood.<br />
O kiss the arrow, bear it to the king,<br />
That shaft defiled, and moist with blood of yours.<br />
The seen is weak, and mean and base,<br />
But quick and strong the invisible is.<br />
We are the game, but who is master of the net?<br />
We are the ball, but cannot see the bat.<br />
Where is the artist who now tears, now sews?<br />
The naphtha-thrower who now quenches and now burns,<br />
Who now an infidel will make Siddiq,<span id="page_64_fr_ddagger"></span><a href="#page_64_note_ddagger">‡</a><br />
And now a saintly hermit of Zandiq?<span id="page_64_fr_sect"></span><a href="#page_64_note_sect">§</a><br />

### <span id="pp_2"></span>MOSES AND THE HERDSMAN.

*Mesnavi of Jellâl-aldyn-Rûmi, 2nd Duftur.*

<td>Once Moses saw a herdsman on the road,<br />
Who thus exclaimed:—"O God! O Allah mine!<br />
Where do you live? May I your servant be<br />
To sew your overcoat, to comb your head?<br />
O God, my life I sacrifice to you,<br />
With all my children, all my kin and goods!<br />
Where do you live, that I your head may comb,<br />
Your quilt may make, and thickly sew your coat;<br />
And if some malady you overtake,<br />
I would your comfort be, as kinsfolk should,<br />
To kiss your hands, to rub your little feet;<br />
When sleep you want, to sweep your little place;<br />
Your house if I could see, I always would<br />
Bring oil and milk each eve and morn to you,<br />
<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> Likewise some cheese with bread and greasy cakes<br />
So nice with leaven or with curdled milk.<br />
These make and bring I would each morn and eve;<br />
I would supply and you might eat the food;<br />
My goats would all I sacrifice to you;<br />
My exclamations all are prayers to you."<br />
Thus senseless that poor shepherd spoke;<br />
But Moses said:—"O man, whom do you mean?"<br />
He answered:—"Him who has created us,<br />
Who has produced this earth and wheeling sky!"<br />
Moses replied:—"Your head is going daft:"<br />
Eslám you left, an infidel you turned;<br />
What idle and blasphemous words are these?<br />
Your mouth with cotton ought to be gagged;<br />
Your unbelief will fill the world with dust;<br />
Your infidelity revives the Dibadin.<span id="page_92_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_92_note_*">*</a><br />
In need of quilted coats and socks you stand.<br />
How could such things befit the Sun?<br />
If you these ravings do not cease,<br />
The world will be consumed by flames;<br />
If fire has not appeared, then whence this smoke,<br />
This life so black and spirit so perverse?<br />
If you believe that God a bounteous giver is,<br />
How can you belch out such stolidity?<br />
A stupid friend is like an enemy.<br />
Such adoration God does not require.<br />
To father's or to mother's brother do you speak?<br />
Of body and necessities to God Most High?<br />
Milk is the beverage of a growing youth,<br />
And trowsers are required for the legs;<br />
But if a human being you did mean,<br />
Has not God said:—"I am he, and he I?<br />
When I was sick ye visited me not:<span id="page_92_fr_dagger"></span><a href="#page_92_note_dagger">†</a><br />
Not only he; but I was sick also."<br />
To him who neither sees nor hears your words,<br />
To man, I say, they likewise nonsense are.<br />
To speak unkindly to a bosom-friend<br />
Deadens the heart and friendship kills.<br />
If Fatimah a man you choose to call,<br />
Though males and females both one genus are,<br />
He will, should he be able, drink your blood.<br />
In spite of his mild temper and religion;<br />
Fatimah is a praise in female names,<br />
Applied to men it is like wounds of spears.<br />
To men their hands and feet all comfort bring;<br />
The purity of God they would defile,<br />
<em>He unbegotten is, begetteth not</em>,<span id="page_92_fr_ddagger"></span><a href="#page_92_note_ddagger">‡</a><br />
But giveth life to parents and to sons.<br />
All bodies must be witnesses of Him;<br />
For everything produced here beneath<br />
Created is and must corruption bear,<br />
But made it is, and must a maker want."<br />
He said:—"O Moses, you have sewed up my mouth,<br />
By this repentance you have burnt my soul."<br />
He rent his clothes and heaved a fervent sigh,<br />
Towards the desert looking, sped his way.<br />
A revelation Moses heard from God:—<br />
"My servant you have driven away from me;<br />
You have arrived the union to prepare,<br />
And not for separation's sake:<br />
If help you can, abstain from severing,<br />
<em>Divorce I hate more than all other things</em>.<span id="page_92_fr_sect"></span><a href="#page_92_note_sect">§</a><br />
On each man I his nature did bestow,<br />
To everybody an expression I impart,<br />
Which seems great praise to him, but blame to you;<br />
He thinks it honey, you as poison deem;<br />
It light to him must be, and fire to you;<br />
But roses bright to him, and thorns to you,<br />
What he deems good, as wicked you condemn;<br />
What he applauds, you often disapprove;<br />
We from pure and all impure things are free,<br />
As well as from anxiety and speed.<br />
I man have not produced for gain of mine,<br />
But blessings to bestow on those who worship me.<br />
To Hindus their expression serves for praise;<br />
The Sindhis by their own expression laud;<br />
Their adoration does not make me pure,<br />
They also pure will be and shedding pearls.<br />
Externals, words alone we disregard;<br />
The soul within, its state, must give account;<br />
At hearts we look, whether they humble are,<br />
Though speech may perhaps too bold be;<br />
For heart is essence, speech but accident:<br />
Thus qualities are not essentials.<br />
But why so many words and metaphors?<br />
Flames, flames I want, comform yourself to them;<br />
The fire of love you in your soul must raise,<br />
Burn up your meditations, all your tropes.<br />
O Moses, formalists quite different are<br />
From those whose inmost souls do burn with fires!<br />
Always to glow befits the lovers' hearts.<br />
No taxes, tithes are asked from empty towns.<span id="page_92_fr_dvert"></span><a href="#page_92_note_dvert">‖</a><br />
If sin he speaks, do not him sinner call;<br />
If martyred and full of blood then wash him not:<br />
Blood martyrs better fits than water does;<br />
This wrong outweighs a hundred-fold reward.<br />
In the Kabah the Qeblah cannot be looked at.<span id="page_92_fr_para"></span><a href="#page_92_note_para">¶</a><br />
What matters it if divers do not jerk their feet?<br />
You must not guidance seek from the inebriate,<br />
Who rend their clothes; can they be asked to mend?<br />
From all religions love's belief differs;<br />
The lovers' sects and rites are God alone.<br />

### <span id="pp_3"></span>THE FIVE SENSES.

<tr class="odd">
<td>United are the senses five,<br />
They all from one original spring:<br />
The food of one is strength for all,<br />
Each to the others drink supplies.<br />
Sight by the eyes increases love,<br />
Love in the heart will truth augment,<br />
Truth every sense will rouse from sleep,<br />
Taste friendship with the senses makes.<br />
When an internal sense the bonds have opened,<br />
Each other sense transfigured is;<br />
When one sense things unfelt perceives,<br />
To senses what's unseen revealed will be.<br />
If one ram leaps a little from the flock,<br />
All others follow in its track.<br />
Impel the sheep of your perceptions<br />
To graze in "pastures <em>He</em> produced,"<span id="page_268_fr_*"></span><a href="#page_268_note_*">*</a><br />
To feed on basil sweet and hyacinths,<br />
Ways to find, to rose-groves of truths divine;<br />
Each sense to the others a herald will be,<br />
And all to the heavenly paradise will go.<br />
Your senses to your senses secrets tell<br />
Without a tongue, a tale, or trope,<br />
Although their story is the midwife of comments,<br />
The surmise, source to speculate upon;<br />
But things self-evident and plain<br />
Admit no explanation or comment.<br />
When all perceptions your senses have enslaved<br />
The spheres cannot escape your ken;<br />
When in the realm of husks questions arise<br />
Its very kernel is proved to be but husk;<br />
Amidst disputes of scarcity in blades<br />
Their seeds you are to strive to find!<br />
When spheres but husks will be, the spirit's light the grain,—<br />
The one is seen, the other hid; start not:—<br />
The body can be seen, the soul is hid;<br />
But intellect is more concealed than the soul,<br />
Therefore the spirit seeks the sense, and soars beyond:<br />
You motion see and life perceive,<br />
But that intellect fills it you forget;<br />
Yet inspiration transcends intellect,<br />
It is a mystery divine and unrevealed.<br />

*Siddiq*, epithet of the Khalyf Abu Bekr, here taken to represent piety.

<span id="page_64_note_sect"></span>[§](#page_64_fr_sect.md) *Zandiq* here
means a heretic, but literally one who follows the *Zand* books, *i.e.*
a Zoroastrian.

<span id="footnotes_page_92">p. 92</span>

<span id="page_92_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_92_fr_*.md) Alluding to
pre-Islamitic times, when Dibadin was worshipped.

<span id="page_92_note_dagger"></span>[†](#page_92_fr_dagger.md) There is a
tradition very closely corresponding to what occurs in Matt. xxv. 45:
"Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not
to me."

<span id="page_92_note_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_92_fr_ddagger.md) *Qorân*,
cxii. 3.

<span id="page_92_note_sect"></span>[§](#page_92_fr_sect.md) There is a
tradition that God said the above words.

<span id="page_92_note_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_92_fr_dvert.md) Empty towns
are persons who have received no religious instruction; and therefore no
ritual worship, here expressed by taxes and tithes, can be required of
them.

<span id="page_92_note_para"></span>[¶](#page_92_fr_para.md) The Kabah is
the Qeblah, *i.e.* direction in which Moslems look when they pray,
therefore a person already within the Kabah cannot look towards it.
