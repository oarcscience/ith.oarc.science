## BIOGRAPHY OF JELLÂL-AL-DIN RÛMI.

BY E. REHATSEK, M.C.E., Hon. Mem. B. Br. R. As. Soc.

   The prince of Çufi poets, Mullânâ Jellâl-al-din Muhammad
ul-Balkhîur-Rûmi, was born at Balkh on the 6th of the month Rabi’ I.
<span class="small">A.H.</span> 604 (1st October <span
class="small">A.D.</span> 1207). His principal work is the *Meṣnavi*,
which consists of six *daftars* or volumes, and treats on an
extraordinary variety of subjects, stories, fables, parables, legends,
and Ḳorân-texts, all permeated by the spirit of the Çufi doctrines; and
second to it is his Diwân, a collection of lyrical poems,—both known
from the banks of the Ganges to the shores of the Bosporus. This poet,
the founder of the order of whirling dervishes, who have numerous
convents and endowed establishments <span id="page_294">p. 294</span> in
Turkey, spent the greater portion of his life in that country, and is
therefore called *Rûmi*, the Turk; but, according to the *Nafhât-ul-uns*
of Jâmi, his visions began at a very early age in his own country. When
he was five years old he had manifestations from the invisible world,
such as sights of angels, of genii, and of men within the domes of
glory. It is stated in a record in the handwriting of Mullânâ
Behâ-al-din Vulud, that when Jellâl-al-din Muhammad, on a certain Friday
when six years of age, was playing with some other little boys on the
flat house-tops of Balkh, one of the little fellows suggested that they
should jump over from one house-top to another; Jellâl-al-din replied
that as such movements are peculiar to dogs, cats, and other animals, it
would be a pity that human beings should imitate them, but that, if they
felt any power in their souls, they ought to fly *heavenwards* together
with him. That moment he disappeared from the sight of his playmates,
who became sorry and raised a shout of lamentation whereupon he returned
after a short while, but with the hue of his countenance changed and his
eyes altered, and said, "Whilst conversing with you, I saw a company of
persons dressed in green raiment, who took me up and showed me the
miracles of the upper world; but when your cries and wailings ascended
they again deposited me here." It is said that at that age he partook of
food only once in three or four days.

   It is said that when Jellâl-al-din emigrated from Balkh he met Sheikh
Farid-al-din A’ṭṭâr at Nishapûr, who was at that time well stricken in
years, and who presented him with his *Esrâr-nâmah*, or "book of
mysteries," which he ever afterwards carried about his person; he also
imitated his doctrines, as it is said—

By Shams his spiritual teacher, Shams Tabrizi, is meant, Elsewhere we

   On being told that a certain man had said he was at his service "with
heart and life," he replied, "Hush! Among men this lie finds credit,"
and asked, "Whence have you obtained your heart and life, that you can
place them at the service of men?" He was nevertheless in the habit of
saying, "I am not that body which appears to the *A’âsheks* (lovers of
God), but the pleasure and gladness produced in the hearts of *Murîds*
(disciples) by my words. Allah! Allah! when you obtain that gladness,
and taste that joy, consider it happiness, and give thanks; that is me!"
Hisâm-al-din was merely his amanuensis, but from several flattering
references to him in the *Meṣnavi* he might be wrongly considered to
have occupied a far higher position. To him he said, "It is necessary to
sit knee to knee with the Avliâ (pl. of *Veli*, saint) of God, because
such proximity bears momentous consequences."

   Hisim-al-dîn was no doubt a faithful amanuensis and disciple, but on
some occasions a little admonition might have been judicious; on the
death of his wife he could not be induced for a long time to attend to
his duty, and the poet remonstrated:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="odd">
<td>"One moment to be absent from him is not good,<br />
For separation will increase mishaps.<br />
No matter what your state; attend on him,<br />
Because proximity will love augment."</td>

</tbody>

   He said that although a bird flying up from the earth cannot reach
heaven, it nevertheless gains the advantage of being further from the
net; thus a man who becomes a dervish, though he cannot attain
perfection, is distinguished above the common crowd of men, and is
delivered from the troubles of the world.

   A worldly fellow once excused himself to him for his remissness in
visiting him, but Jellâl-al-din replied, "There is no need of any
excuses, because I am as thankful for your not coming as others are for
your coming."

   Seeing one of his companions in a state of melancholy, he said, "All
sadness arises from too great attachment to this world; as soon as you
are freed from it and consider yourself a stranger therein, you will
perceive, from everything <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> you behold
or taste, that it cannot abide with you, and that you must go to another
place: therefore you will no longer feel any anxiety."

   He was also in the habit of saying that he is a superior man who does
not grieve on being affronted, and he a generous man who gives no pain
to one deserving to be affronted. Mullânâ Sirâj-al-din Ḳunavi was a
great man of the period, but not on good terms with Jellâl-al-din, and
when it was reported to him that the latter had on a certain occasion
said, "I agree with all the seventy-three sects of the Muhammadan
religion," he determined to get the Mullâ insulted. Accordingly he sent
one of his followers, who was a learned man, to ask the Mullâ in a large
company whether he had really uttered the above sentiment, and in case
of receiving an affirmative reply, to affront him with bad language; but
to all his taunts the Mullâ only smiled and replied, "I agree also with
all you have said," whereupon the man returned ashamed. Sheikh
Rakn-al-din a’llâ al-doulah stated that he had been much pleased with
this meek answer.

   He daily asked his servant, "Is there anything in the house to-day?"
and on receiving a negative reply he became exhilarated and thankful,
saying, "Praise be to God, this day our house is like that of the
prophet!" If the servant said, "Whatever we require is at hand in the
kitchen," he was displeased and said, "The smell of Pharaoh is rising
from this house." He seldom or never used wax-lights in his house, and
was contented with oil-lamps, saying, "Those are for kings, and these
for devotees (*çalûk*)."

   On a certain occasion a company, in which also Sheikh Çadr-al-din
Ḳunavi was present, requested the Mullâ to officiate as Emâm (leader of
the prayers), but he replied, "We are Abdâls, we sit down or get up
wherever we happen to be; those endowed with Çufism and dignity are
worthy to be Emâms," and pointing to Sheikh Çadr-al-din as one of these,
he coutinued, "Whoever prays after a pious Emâm is just as if he played
after the prophet."

   One day the Mullâ being present at a devotional exercise, it occurred
to a dervish to ask him what *Faḳr*<span
id="page_295_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_295_note_*) is, whereupon the Mulla
recited the following quatrain:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Faḳr is essence, all else accident;<br />
Faḳr is health, all else disease.<br />
This world is all deceit and fraud,<br />
Faḳr is of the next a mystery."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   It has been mentioned above that the Mullâ was a disciple of
Farid-al-din A’ṭṭâr; him he recollected even during his last illness,
when he said to his companions, "Be not afflicted at my going, because
the victorious light will fifty years hence radiate from the spirit of
Sheikh Farid-al-din A’ṭṭâr. Remember me in whatever state you are, that
I may aid you, in whatever garment I am." He also said, "Do not
associate with any persons except such as are of your own kind; because
on this subject my lord Shams-al-din Tabrîzi (may God sanctify his
secret!) has said to me that the sign of a disciple (*murid*) who has
found acceptance is that he never associates with strangers, and that
when he suddenly falls into their company he feels ill at ease, like a
hypocrite in a mosque, or a little child in a school. On his death-bed
he also said to his companions, "In this world I have but two
connections—the one with my body, and the other with you; this latter
connection will not be severed even after I shall, by the favour of God,
become separated and isolated from this world." On the same occasion
Sheikh Çadr-al-din also paid him a visit and said, "May God restore you
to health quickly!" But the Mullâ replied, "Let my restoration to health
consist in the removal of the only remaining garment which yet separates
the lover from his beloved. Are you not willing that light should be
joined to light?

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">

<tr class="odd">
<td>"Denuded of body am I, and <em>He</em> of unreality.<br />
I roam and verge to bounds of union."<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

   The last injunction of the Mullâ to his companions was, "I recommend
you to fear God secretly and openly, to be frugal in your eating, to
sleep little, and to speak little. To abandon everything sinful, to fast
and to pray much. To renounce every kind of last for ever, and to bear
insults from everybody. Do not keep up any intercourse with fools and
vulgar persons, but cultivate this society of men who are pious and
noble. The best men are those who are useful <span id="page_296">p.
296</span> to the human race, and the best words are those which are the
fewest and the most instructive."

   On being asked to appoint a worthy successor, he uttered the name of
Chelebi Hisâm-al-din; the question being thrice repeated, he gave the
fourth time the same reply. Being questioned concerning his son Sulṭân
Vulud, he replied, "He is a hero, there is no necessity for any
injunction about him." Then Chelebi Hisâm-al-din asked the Mullâ whom he
wished to pray over his corpse at the burial, and he said, "Sheikh
Çadr-al-din." He expired at sunset on the 5th of the month Jomâdi II.
<span class="small">A.H.</span> 672 (18th December <span
class="small">A.D.</span> 1273), at the age of 68 years according to the
Muhammadan, or 66 according to the Christian reckoning, at Ḳoniah, i.e.
Iconium, in Asia Minor, where he had spent the greater portion of his
life, and from its being in the Turkish dominions he obtained the
surname of Rûmi.

   The above Sulṭân Vulud was also a poet, and died at Ḳoniah, <span
class="small">A.H.</span> 712 (1312). He is called Behâ-al-din, of the
same name with Jellâl-al-din's father, who, when our poet was yet a boy,
being displeased wîth the government of Khowarizmshâh, determined to
emigrate for ever from the district of Balkh, under the pretence of
going on a pilgrimage to Mekkah. Accordingly he departed with this son
and went first to Nishapur, where they made the acquaintance of Sheikh
Farid-al-din A’ṭṭâr, who had gathered around him many disciples, and who
discovered the precocious talents of the boy, presenting him with the
*Esrâr-nâmah* and uttering the prediction:—

</td>

   Both father and son continued their travels in the company of a
valuable guide and spiritual teacher, Sayyid Tarmad, whose sobriquet was
Burhân; with him they visited the holy shrines of Mekkah and Jerusalem.
They had not completed one half of their intended tour, however, when he
took leave and advised them to settle in Turkey. Accordingly Behâ-al-din
took his son Jellâl-al-din to Ḳoniah, where they established themselves
and ceased their wanderings. At that time ’Allâ-al-din, the Seljukide,
governed the country; he was so pleased with the company of Behâ-al-din
that he became his disciple; when his father died Jellâl-al-din took his
place, but he soon got tired of worldly honours, and, abandoning his
position, dedicated himself wholly to spiritual life:—

<tr class="odd">

</td>

   He sought consolation in the society of kindred spirits, the chief of
whom were Shams-al-din Tabrîzi—whose name appears at the end of almost
every ode of his *Diwân* in token of affection, because Jallâl-al-din
himself acknowledged him as his spiritual guide—and Ḥisâm-al-din.

   Shams-al-din Tabrîzi, whose full name is Mullânâ Shams-al-din ’Ali
Ben Mâlak Dâd Tabrîzi, appears to have been a restless character and an
innovator. He travelled about much and made many enemies. When
Shams-al-din arrived at Ḳoniah for the first time, he paid a visit to
Jallâl-al-din, who happened to be sitting near a tank with several books
near him; he asked what they were, and on being told that they were
called *Kyl wa Kâl*, he said, "What have you to do with them?" and threw
them all into the water. The Mullâ exclaimed with a sigh, "O Dervish,
what have you done? Some of these were my father's compositions, which
cannot be replaced!" Hereupon Shams-al-din put his hand into the water
and pulled out all the books, one after the other; and lo, not one of
them was wet. Jellâl-al-din was much astonished, but Shams-al-din
rejoined, "This is joy and ecstasy: what do you know of these spiritual
matters?" And their intimacy began from that day.

   Shams-al-din was constantly roaming about. He wore a robe of coarse
black cloth, and took lodgings in the caravanseraî at whatever place he
happened to arrive. He came to Ḳoniah <span class="small">A.H.</span>
642 (<span class="small">A.D.</span> 1244), but could not remain there
on that occasion longer than one year, as an attempt was made on his
life. At that time Jellâl-al-din Rumi saw his friend for the <span
id="page_297">p. 297</span> last time, and was so grieved at the
separation that he withdrew himself entirely from the world, became a
dervish, and founded the order of dervishes called after his name, and
at present still well known in the Turkish empire.

   When Shams-al-din arrived in his travels at Ḳoniah, in <span
class="small">A.H.</span> 642, he took lodgings in the quarter of the
confectioners. One day Jellâl-al-din, who was engaged in teaching
various sciences, happened to pass, with a company of learned men from
the college, through the quarter of the confectioners. On that occasion
Mullâna Shams-al-din sallied out from his lodgings, and taking hold of
the bridle of Jellâl-al-din's mule asked him whether Bâizid (a
celebrated saint) or Muhammad was the greater? Jellâl-al-din said, "It
seemed that on account of that terrible question the seven heavens had
fallen asunder and had been precipitated upon the earth; a large fire
appeared to issue from my bowels and to envelop my brains, the smoke
whereof ascended to the throne of God, and I replied, 'As Muhammad is
the greatest of men, what can Bâizid be?' He rejoined, 'What do
Muhammad's words, "*We have not known thee as we ought*," imply? whilst
Bâizid says, "*O God, how high is my position! I am the king of
kings!*"' I replied:—'Bâizid's thirst was quenched by one drop, and he
boasted of satisfaction, because the vessel of his intellect was filled
thereby. That light was as much as the little window of his house could
admit, whilst Muhammad was subject to a great dropsy and thirst,—he was
daily praying for closer intimacy.'" At these words Mullânâ Shams-al-din
gave a shout and fell down senseless. Jellâl-al-din alighted from his
mule, and ordered his disciples to carry him to the college. He placed
the head of Shams-al-din on his own knees, took him by the hand, and
they departed together. During three months they lived in retirement,
engaged in fasting and prayer; they did not come out once, and no one
ventured to disturb their privacy.

   According to the *Nafhât-ul-uns*, in which the flight of Shams-al-din
from Ḳoniah is represented in a somewhat supernatural way, the year in
which it took place is given as <span class="small">A.H.</span> 645, and
not <span class="small">A.H.</span> 643 as stated above. In the
*Nafhât-ul-uns* it is related that one night when Jellâl-al-din and
Shams-al-din were sitting together in retirement, a man from without
arrived and beckoned to the latter. The Sheikh got up immediately and
said to Jellâl-al-din, "They are calling me in order to kill me."
Jellâl-al-din waited long in vain for his return; seven men had lain in
ambush expecting him with drawn swords, with which they attacked him,
but he uttered such a shout that all of them fainted away and fell to
the ground. One of these men was Behâ-al-din, or as in the lithographed
copy, ’Allâ-al-din Muhammad, the son of Jellâl-al-din. When these seven
men recovered their senses, they perceived nothing but one drop of
blood, and from that day to this nothing more transpired concerning that
prince of the invisible world.

   The real cause of the attempt to assassinate Shams-al-din, and of his
flight in consequenoe thereof, must probably be sought in his open
disbelief in Islâm, which Jellâl-al-din was always cunning enough to
disguise tolerably well in his own utterances and writings. He,
moreover, so monopolized the society of Jellâl-al-din that the disciples
of the latter, together with his son, were determined to murder
Shams-al-din. It is plain enough, from the last page of the *Meṣnavi*,
that the above conjecture is true, as will appear from the following:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Some time he with his friend retired sat,<br />
All alien spirits quite shut out,<br />
Enjoying the pure draught of union.<br />
He was the confidant of his good friend;<br />
His pupils did lament and grumble,<br />
'Whence came this ragged mendicant?<br />
Whence brought he all this fraud and roguery,<br />
To isolate so quickly our great Chief?<br />
O God! Now Islâm is despised, destroyed,<br />
The dome of Islâm is now led astray!<br />
This robber is none but a heretic,<br />
By God! his blood is free and free!'"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

   It may be seen that in these verses the 'great Chief' and the 'dome
of Islâm' is Jellâl-al-din Rûmi, whilst the ragged mendicant and heretic
robber is Shams-al-din.

   Jellâl-al-din Rûmi's successor Chelebi Hisâm-al-din, whose full name
is Sheikh Hisâm-al-din Hasan Ben Muhammad Ben Alhasan Ben Akhi Turk.
Becoming the successor of a *Pir* or *Sheikh*, *i.e.* spiritual guide,
implies also the acceptance of all his duties and the allegiance of his
pupils; and if the Pir was a man of great authority, learning, &c. his
successor is also expected to be one. It appears that Hisâm-al-din got
tired of the many Ghazâls composed by his teacher Jellâl-al-din, and
requested him to write a connected and large poem; hereupon the latter
pulled out a piece of paper from his turban containing the first
twenty-eight distichs of his *Meṣnâvi*, beginning with the words—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Hear how yon reed in sadly pleasing tales<br />
Departed bliss and present woe bewails!"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

and ending with the words—

|                                                                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Here pause my song; and thou vain world, farewell."<span id="page_298_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_298_note_*) |

   Jellâl-al-din said, "Before you ever thought of it, the idea of
composing a work of this kind had been instilled into my heart from on
high." The last piece in the *Meṣnâvi* itself contains an account of the
manner in which this celebrated work was commenced, and brought to an
end by Hisâm-al-din, who wrote down every word of it as it fell from the
lips of his master. Sometimes Jellâl-al-din was so full of his subject
that from the beginning of the night till the next morning dawned he
dictated to Hisâm-al-din, who was in the habit of again reading in a
loud voice to the Mullâ all he had written. When the first volume was
completed the wife of Chelebi Hisâm-al-din died, and the work was
interrupted, as alluded to in the first distich of the second volume:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Delayed was this <em>Meṣnâvi</em> for a time.<br />
Respite was needed blood to milk to change."</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   After that no interruption of any length appears to have taken place,
till the whole work was brought to a termination. That Hisâm-al-din must
have been an enthusiastic admirer of this book appears from the
following words he uttered:—"When the *Meṣnâvi* is being read aloud, all
who are present get drowned in its light, and I behold a company of
spirits from the invisible world who cut off with their swords the roots
and branches of the faith of all those who do not listen with complete
sincerity, and gradually drag them into hell-fire." But Jellâl-al-din
replied:—

<table data-align="center" data-cellpadding="10">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Of verses mine the foes you see<br />
Headlong dragged to flames of fire.<br />
Hisâm-al-din, saw you their state?<br />
Their acts has God revealed to you?"<br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

   The above words of Hisâm-al-din imply that as apparently many
sentiments contrary to the strict laws of Islâm are uttered,—unless
listened to with great and sincere attention, the hearing of the
*Meṣnâvi* will lead to infidelity, and consequently to eternal
perdition; whilst the answer of his master is conceived in that tolerant
spirit which permeates the whole *Meṣnâvi*, and which ventures to
condemn no one rashly.

   No doubt the *Meṣnâvi* contains also many strictly orthodox and even
bigoted pieces; it must, however, be allowed that there are many which
can never meet with the approval of strict Musalmâns of any sect. Such a
piece is "[Moses and the Herdsman](sfrv3.htm#pp_2)" (*Ind. Ant.* vol.
III. p. 90, March 1874), at the end of which the author even disclaims
to be a religious guide, and openly avows that the religion of love is
the only true one:—

my acquaintance with Jellâl-al-din Rûmi is of more than twenty years'
standing, and I flatter myself that I have, during that time, learnt to
understand him a little. Nothing would please me more than to see better
justice done to this poet than I can do.
