## {The Attack of the Partizan of Justice upon the party of the Ismâ’ilîyeh, and the Angry Eye upon the party of the Ḳarâmaṭah}

### I.

   *THE Ismâ’ilîyeh*.—These are called by seven appellations. \[1.\] The
Bâṭinîyeh, on account of their profession of the inward sense of the
Book, beside its outward sense. For they say, that the Ḳurân has an
outward and an inward sense; and as for its meaning, that its outward
sense appertains to the sciences of language, and that the relation of
the inward sense to the outward is like the relation of the pith to the
bark. And they say that the laying hold of its outward sense punishes
with fatigue in assiduous action,<span
id="page_279_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_279_note_*.md) and that its inward
sense is an aid to the leaving off of action by its outward sense. And
as respects this, they lay hold of his saying,—let him be exalted! "And
so there is established between them a wall, having a gate the inward
part of which, within it, is mercy, and the outward part before it, is
punishment."<span
id="page_279_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_279_note_dagger.md) \[2.\] The
Ḳarâmaṭeh, because their leader, he who levelled the high-way for their
doctrine, was a man named Ḥamdân of Ḳarmaṭ,<span
id="page_279_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_279_note_ddagger.md) which is the
only place of its name, namely, Ḳarmaṭ of Wâsiṭ. \[3.\] The
Ḥaramîyeh,<span id="page_279_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_279_note_sect.md) on
account of their desecration of sacred things, and allowing of things
forbidden. \[4.\] The Sab’îyeh,<span
id="page_279_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_279_note_dvert.md) because they
think that the Nâṭiḳs of the revealed laws, that is, the Envoys, are
seven, <span id="page_280">p. 280</span> namely, Adam, and Nûḥ, and
Ibrâhîm, and Mûsa, and ’Îsa, and Muḥammed,—let the divine benediction
and peace be to him! and Muḥammed the Mehdy,<span
id="page_280_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_280_note_*.md) the seventh of the
Nâṭiḳs; and that between each two of the Nâṭiḳs there are seven Imâms,
who rely upon the law of the Nâṭiḳ; and that there must of necessity be
in every age seven who are imitated, and by whom direction is given, in
respect to religion, who differ from one another in rank, namely, an
Imâm, who aids the religion of God, who is the acme of arguments in
proof of the religion of God; and a Ḥujjeh,<span
id="page_280_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_280_note_dagger.md) who relieves
the Imâm, sustaining his science, and thereby authenticating him; and a
Dhû-l-maṣṣah,<span
id="page_280_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_280_note_ddagger.md) who imbibes
science from the Ḥujjeh, that is, receives it from him;—these three, and
also certain Bâbs, who are the Dâ’is,<span
id="page_280_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_280_note_sect.md) namely, an Akbar,
that is a Dâ’i Akbar;<span
id="page_280_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_280_note_dvert.md) who is the
fourth allong them, who elevates the degrees of believers; and a Dâ’i
Madhûn,<span id="page_280_fr_para"></span>[¶](#page_280_note_para.md) who
receives the engagements binding inquirers from among the People of the
outward sense, and causes them to enter into clientship with the Imâm,
and opens to them the gate of science and knowledge; and he is the
fifth; and a Mukellib,<span
id="page_280_fr_**"></span>[\*\*](#page_280_note_**.md) whose degree in
religion is indeed elevated, but who is not licensed in respect to the
office of Dâ’i, whose license on the contrary respects argumentation
with men, and who accordingly argues, and renders eager for the Dâ’i,
like the hunter's dog, until, when he has argued with one of the People
of the outward sense, and has drawn him off from his doctrine, so that
he is averse to it, and inquires after the truth, he, the Mukellib,
conducts him to the Dâ’i, who <span id="page_281">p. 281</span> is
licensed to receive the engagements binding him; (says El-Âmidy, they
call such a person a Mukellib only because he is like the ravenous
beast, who draws off the hunter's dog from the game, according to what
he says agreeing therewith, and ye know not of ravenous beasts any which
train dogs;) and he is the sixth; and a Mumin,<span
id="page_281_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_281_note_*.md) who follows after him,
that is, pants for the Dâ’i, from whom are received the engagements
binding him, and who believes, and is thoroughly acquainted with the
engagement, and enters into clientship with the Imâm, and acts according
to him; and he is the seventh. These, they say, are like the heavens,
and the earths, and the seas, and the days of the week, and the planets
which govern with a command. \[5.\] The Bâbekîyeh,<span
id="page_281_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_281_note_dagger.md) inasmuch as a
party among them follow Bâbek El-Khurṣany in respect to going out clad
in the mantle of Yemen, and in red, because they wore red in the days of
Bâbek, or because they were like those who differed from them of the
Muslims, in respect to the mantle. \[6.\] The Ismâ’ilîyeh, an account of
their affirming the imamship as the right of Isma’îl Ibn Ja’far
Eṣ-Ṣâdiḳ, who was the eldest of Ja’far's sons; or, as some say, on
account of the derivation of their heterodoxy from Muḥammed Ibn
Isma’îl.<span
id="page_281_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_281_note_ddagger.md)

   And the root from which their preaching of the abrogation of the laws
grew up, was the Kobâdîyeh, a sect of the Magians, who, being goaded by
Islam, aimed to allegorize the laws in certain ways coming back to the
principles of their forefathers;<span
id="page_281_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_281_note_sect.md) that is to say,
they assembled, and reminded one another of the position of undivided
rule which their forefathers held, and said, "There is no way for us to
eject the Muslims by the sword, on account <span id="page_282">p.
282</span> of their superiority, and their possession of the seats of
empire; but let us use stratagem, by allegorizing their laws, with a
view to a coming back to our principles, leading on by degrees the weak
among them; and so that will necessitate their being at variance with
one another, and the shaking of their system." And their head, in
respect to that,<span id="page_282_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_282_note_*.md)
was Ḥamdân of Ḳarmaṭ, or, as some say, ’Abdallah Ibn Meimûn
El-Ḳaddaḥ.<span
id="page_282_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_282_note_dagger.md)

   And in calling and leading on men, they have degrees of finesse;
which comprehends \[1.\] the judging by the countenance of the state of
the person called, whether he is favorable to the call, or not; and the
saying, "Thou wilt make excuse for the putting of the germ into the
trunk,"<span id="page_282_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_282_note_ddagger.md)
that is, for the call of one not favorable, is in accordance with that;
and they refuse to dispute "in a house where there is a lamp," that is,
in a place where there is a doctor of the law, or a metaphysician; and
then \[2.\] the familiarizing oneself with the inclination of every one
of those called, with that which he inclines to, as respects his desire,
and his native bent, pertaining to withdrawment from the world, and free
living; and so, if he inclines to withdrawment from the world, it is set
off in fair colors before him, and its opposite is depreciated; and if
he inclines to free living, that is set off in fair colors before him,
and its opposite is depreciated, until the man is thereby gained; and
then \[3.\] the causing to doubt in respect to the corner-stones of the
law, and the abbreviations of the surahs,<span
id="page_282_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_282_note_sect.md) in that one says,
"What is the meaning of the isolated letters in the beginnings of the
surahs? and of the statute requiring woman in her menses to fast,
without a statute requiring her to pray, that is, why is one needful,
and not the other? and of the necessity of ablution on account of the
seminal discharge, and not of the urine? and of the number of the <span
id="page_283">p. 283</span> prostrations in prayer, that is, why are
they in some cases four, and in some, three, and in some, two?"—and so
on to things remote from these; and the reason why they thus render them
doubtful, and cause to inquire the answer in regard to these things, is
that they may be inquired of, on their return, respecting them; and then
\[4.\] the confirmation, which includes two things, namely, first, the
receiving of the engagement from the candidate, in that they say that
God's Sunneh has had currency by the receiving of engagements and
pledges, and alledge, in proof of that, his saying,—let him be exalted!
"And when we received from the Prophets their engagements,"<span
id="page_283_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_283_note_*.md) and then receive, with
receiving, his engagement, made in accordance with a firm belief, on his
part, that no secret thing is hidden from them; and second, the
obligating him, in behalf of the Imâm, with respect to the clearing up
of that which he is confused about, of the things which one presents to
him; because it is he who knows them, and the candidate has no command
of them until he elevates himself to something of the degree which
pertains to him, and comes to the Imâm; and then \[5.\] the imposition,
which is the pretension of agreement with them on the part of the great
in religious and worldly affairs,<span
id="page_283_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_283_note_dagger.md) so that the
candidate may be more in favor of that to which one calls him; and then
\[6.\] the putting upon a foundation, which is the arranging of premises
to which he who is called is favorable, and which he grants, which point
him to that false doctrine to which one calls him; and then \[7.\] the
divestiture, which is the causing to rest in the neglect of corporeal
actions; and then \[8.\] the despoiling of the firm beliefs of religion.

   And when an affair of calling has gone so far, they set about to
abrogate prohibitions, and to incite to indulgence in pleasures, and to
allegorize the laws, agreeably to their saying that the partial washing
signifies friendship to the Imâm; and as for the entire washing, that it
is the receiving by hearsay from the Madhûn, when the Imâm is hidden,
what prayer is; and that prayer signifies the Nâṭiḳ, who is the Envoy,
as is proved by his saying,—let him be exalted! "Verily, prayer
restrains from depravity and crime;"<span
id="page_283_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_283_note_ddagger.md) and that the
having nocturnal pollution signifies <span id="page_284">p. 284</span>
the divulging of one of their secrets to one who is not of the people to
whom it belongs, without any object in so doing; and the ablution of the
whole body, the renewal of the pledge; and alms-giving, the purification
of the soul by knowledge of the religion which they profess; and the
Ka’beh, the Prophet, and the gate \[of the Ka’beh,\] ’Aly; and Eṣ-Ṣafâ,
’Aly, and El-Marweh,<span
id="page_284_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_284_note_*.md) the Prophet; and the
place of rendezvous of pilgrims,<span
id="page_284_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_284_note_dagger.md) the
familiarizing;<span
id="page_284_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_284_note_ddagger.md) and the
bending,<span id="page_284_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_284_note_sect.md) the
responding to the call; and the circling of the House seven times,
friendship to the seven Imâms; and the Garden, the repose of bodies from
duty; and the Fire, the severity of toil in duty;—and so on to other of
their ravings.

   And their doctrine is, that God is not existent, nor non-existent;
neither knowing, nor ignorant; neither powerful, nor weak;—and so on, as
to all the attributes; and that because veritable affirmation requires
the association of him with things existent, which is an
anthropomorphism; while absolute denial requires the association of him
with things non-existent, which is a making void. But that, on the
contrary, he is necessarily possessed of these attributes, and the Lord
of contraries.<span
id="page_284_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_284_note_dvert.md) And often they
blend their system with the system of the Philosophers, and accordingly
say that he,—let him be exalted! produced by his Amr the perfect
Intelligence, and that by means of that was the production of the Soul,
which is not perfect; and so, that the Soul yearns after the perfect
Intelligence, seeking to be quickened by it; and consequently, that
there is a requiring of motion from incompleteness to completion; and
that motion is perfected only through its \[the Soul's\] restlessness;
and so, that the bodies of the celestial spheres originate, and move
with a circular movement, as governed by the Soul; and so, that by means
of them originate the simple elementary <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> natural properties; and that by means of the simples
originate the composites, namely, minerals, and plants, and the species
of animals; and that the most excellent of them is man, on account of
his preparedness for the effusion upon him of the Lights of the Holy
One, and his connection with the higher world; and that, as the higher
world contains a perfect Universal Intelligence, and an imperfect
Universal Soul, which is the source of beings, so there is in the lower
world a perfect Intelligence, which is a means of deliverance, by
likeness in it to the relation of the primitive Soul to the primitive
Intelligence, in what relates to the causing of beings to exist; and
that that is the Imâm, who is a Nâṭiḳ-Legatee; and that, as the
celestial spheres move as moved by the Intelligence and the Soul, in
like manner living souls move to deliverance, as moved by the Nâṭiḳ and
the Legatee,—that it is so in every age and period.

   Says El-Âmidy, Such were the opinions of some senseless person; and
when El-Ḥasan Ibn Muḥammed Eṣ-Ṣabbâḥ appeared,<span
id="page_285_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_285_note_*.md) he exerted himself, and
the call assumed that he was the Ḥujjeh, who relieves the Imâm, whom no
period may be without. And the sum of his system was that which took the
precedence, respecting the need of the teacher. Moreover, he prohibited
common people from meddling with the sciences, and people of note from
looking into the ancient Books, lest their disgraces should be exposed.
And afterwards they became Philosophers, and ceased not to make sport of
the canons of religious ordinances and legal commands; and they
entrenched themselves in fortresses, and their power increased, and any
kings whose vezirs were of their party, feared calamity, for they made a
show of neglecting duties, and openly desecrated sacred things, and
became like brute beasts, without any religious control, or legal
restraint.

   Says he \[the author\] respecting the *Tâtârkhânîyeh*,<span
id="page_285_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_285_note_dagger.md) And in the
year 577, the doctors of the law of Samarḳand were <span
id="page_286">p. 286</span> asked,—respecting a man who makes a show of
Islâm, and prays, and fasts, and makes a show of the profession of
unity, and belief in Muḥammed,—let peace be to him! for many years, and
afterwards confesses, saying, "As for me, I have been, during these past
years, a firm believer according to the doctrine of the Ḳarâmaṭeh, and I
have been a Dâ’i to men; and now I am a convert, and return to Islâm,"
and makes now a show of that which he before made a show of, pertaining
to the religion of Islâm, only that he is suspected to hold the doctrine
of the Ḳarâmaṭeh, as if he were among them,—what the sentence is as to
his blood, and his property, and his effects, while the occasion of his
exposing himself, and his confession, is that he has been found out, and
it were idle, until he confesses his doctrine, to put him to death.

   ’Abd-El-Karîm Ibn Muḥammed said, "The putting to death of the
Ḳarâmaṭeh, universally, is a necessary thing, and their being treated
without discrimination, a statute, because they are veritably apostate
unbelievers, and their influence to corrupt the religion of Islâm is
greater than any other, and the injury which they do, the greatest of
injuries."

   Abû-l-Ḥasan Muḥammed Sa’îd said, "It may be said of this man of whom
mention is made, as Abû Ḥanîfeh,—let God be merciful to him! is related
to have said respecting a Ḳadary<span
id="page_286_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_286_note_*.md) who said, in the
presence of Abû Ḥanîfeh, 'I am a convert;' Abû Ḥanîfeh, namely,—let God
be merciful to him! said, 'Conversion on thy part is that thou returnest
to all whom thou hast led astray, and callest them to the truth, and
sayest, "As for me, I have been holding falsehood."'

   And Abû-l-Ḳâsim ’Abd-El-Raḥmân Ibn El-Ḥusein Eṣ-Ṣaffâr said, "With
regard to the like of these, namely, the Ḳarâmaṭeh, whenever we cause
them to be found out, the obligation rests upon the Sultân, in the first
instance, and upon the doctors of the law of the Muslims, in the second
instance, to set it down to their account to put them to death, and to
eradicate them, not admitting, on their part, either conversion, or
apology."

   And Abû Muḥammed ’Abd-El-Karîm Ibn Muḥammed said, "As for all who act
openly, of the Ḳarâmaṭeh,—let <span id="page_287">p. 287</span> God
abandon them! as firm believers according to their doctrine, and become
Dâ’is of men to it, they are not, after that, sincere in their
pretension of conversion, and return to Islâm; because they are not
truly converted, and make a show, on their part, of that which they make
a show of, only after the manner of piety, for the safety of themselves,
and their property, and their families, and their children, or something
thereof; for a certain one said, 'Methinks that to pray, which profits
not, is advantageous among Imâms,' and he was one of the Party of the
Impious; to which his pupil said, 'O my preceptor, what avails this
assiduity, while we acknowledge the faith?'<span
id="page_287_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_287_note_*.md) whereupon he said, 'It
is on account of the custom of the country, and for the protection of
family and children.' So then, if we were to admit, on their part, that
which they pretend of conversion, they would make that turn out to the
overthrow of Islâm and the laws; and the injury to the Muslims would be
greater than that which happens to them of injury from those with whom
they are at war. And accordingly, one of our men tells us that the
doctors of the law in Balkh have decided in favor of shedding the blood
of the Ḳarâmaṭeh, and burning up their houses, after they have declared
themselves of their opinion; and so some of them were beaten with
thongs, and afterwards put to death."

   And Abû Selimeh Muḥammed Ibn Dâwûd Esh-Shâfi’y, said, "Whoever bruits
this vile doctrine, and makes a show, on his part, of the call to it,
let not any conversion be admitted on his part, but on the contrary let
him be put to death. And Abû Se’îd El-Iṣṭakhry, one of our men, was of
this opinion, and said, 'Some of our men have distinguished that which
marks the apostate in the follower of Ḳarmaṭ, with respect to
conversion. And if the follower of Ḳarmaṭ is an apostate, he lets go the
manifest senses of words, and calls up their hidden senses; and so, when
he with his tongue makes a show of conversion on his part, it may be
that, together with that, he declares something hidden, which he
pretends, as his tongue happens to express it, after the manner of
piety; and he gives out that he is already converted, so that his being
a Muslim may not be judged of. <span id="page_288">p. 288</span> And as
for the apostate other than the follower of Ḳarmaṭ, because he calls not
up the hidden senses of words, as the follower of Ḳarmaṭ does, and he
was a Muslim originally, whenever he professes Islâm, he returns, and we
know that he is converted. Verily he,—let him be exalted! says, "So
then, what shall be the portion of those who fight against God and his
Envoy, and exert themselves to corrupt the earth? etc.,"<span
id="page_288_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_288_note_*.md)—which is directed
against those who exert themselves to corrupt the earth; but religion is
worthier and prior, because that which religion enjoins is of more
moment, to be cared for, than the earth, in every respect, and prior to
it."'

   The above is in brief what was said.

   And an inquiry was proposed to the Sheikh el-Islâm, the Seal of
profound investigators, of the party of Ḥanbal, Taḳḳy ed-dîn Ibn
Yatmiyeh, the form of which was as follows:<span
id="page_288_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_288_note_dagger.md) "What say the
learned seignors, the Imâms of religion,—let God be gracious to them
all, and aid them to manifest the plain truth, and to cover the fair
show of errorists! respecting the Nuṣairîyeh, who declare the lawfulness
of wine, and the transmigration of spirits, and the eternity of the
world; and profess to deny the awakening,<span
id="page_288_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_288_note_ddagger.md) and the
gathering, and the resurrection, and the Garden and the Fire, in another
than the life which is of this world; and declare that the five prayers
signify five names, which are ’Aly, and El-Ḥasan, and El-Ḥusein, and
Muḥsin, and Fâṭimeh, so that the mentioning of these five suffices them,
in place of the ablution of the whole body, on account of sexual
intercourse, and the partial washing, and the other conditions of
prayer, and its essentials; and that fasting, in their opinion,
signifies three men, and is the name of three women, all of whom they
enumerate in their books, to mention whom particularly there is no room
here; and that their Deity, who created the heavens and earth, is ’Aly
Ibn Abû; Ṭâlib,—let God be gracious to him! so that he, in the <span
id="page_289">p. 289</span> opinion, is the Deity in the heavens, and
the Imâm on the earth; and the philosophy which maintains the
manifestation of the Deity in this humanity, is based upon their view
that he enters into familiarity with his creatures in order that he may
teach them how they may know him, and serve him;—and that the Nuṣairy
becomes not, in their opinion, a believing Nuṣairy, whom they will sit
with, and in company with whom they will drink, and whom they will let
into their secrets, and to whom they will give in marriage of their
women, until his teacher addresses him; and the substance of the
address, in their opinion, is that they make him swear to the
concealment of his religion, and the knowledge of his elders and the
great ones among the people of his doctrine, and that he will consult no
Muslim, nor any others, excepting those who are of the people of his
religion, and that he acknowledges his Imâm, and his Lord, as manifested
in his revolutions and his periods, and so acknowledges the transmission
of the Ism and the Ma’na<span
id="page_289_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_289_note_*.md) in every epoch and age.
And the Ism, in their opinion, among the first of men, was Adam, and the
Ma’na, Shait;<span
id="page_289_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_289_note_dagger.md) and the Ism,
Ya’ḳûb, and the Ma’na, Yûsuf; and they use to prove this representation,
as they think, that which is in the Ḳurân, namely, a story about Ya’ḳûb
and Yûsuf;—let peace be to them both! and accordingly say, "What was
Ya’ḳûb? as for him, he was the Ism, for what power exceeds its
station?<span
id="page_289_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_289_note_ddagger.md) and he says,
'Presently, I will ask pardon for you of my Lord; verily, he is the
Pardoner, the Compassionate;'<span
id="page_289_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_289_note_sect.md) and as for Yûsuf,
he was the Ma’na who is asked, and so he says, 'There is no reprimanding
of you this day, God pardons you,'<span
id="page_289_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_289_note_dvert.md) and brings not
in the authority of another, because he knows that he is the absolute
Deity." And they lay it down that Mûsa was the Ism, and Yûshû’a, the
Ma’na, and say, "As for Yûshû’a, the sun yielded to him, after he had
commanded it, and obeyed his command; and does the sun yield to any one
except its Lord?" And they lay it down that Suleimân was the Ism, and
Âṣaf; the Ma’na, and say, "Suleimân was impotent to cause to be present
the throne of Belḳîs, and Âṣaf had power to do it, because Suleimân
<span id="page_290">p. 290</span> was the Ism, and Âṣaf was the Ma’na,
the Potent, the Powerful."<span
id="page_290_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_290_note_*.md) And they enumerate the
Prophets and the Messengers, one by one, after the manner of this talk,
up to the time of the Envoy of God,—let the divine benediction and peace
be to him! and so they say that Muḥammed was the Ism, and ’Aly, the
Ma’na; and they carry on the enumeration, in this order, through every
age, up to our time. So much for this.

   But it is a part of the substance of religion, and of the address, in
their opinion, that instruction be given that ’Aly is the Lord; and
Muḥammed, the Veil; and Selmân, the Gate; and that these, in this order,
have not ceased, and will not cease to be. And to the rhyming which is
famous among them, of some of their extravagances, belongs the saying of
one, the accursed, the disbeliever in God,—let him be exalted! "I
testify that there is no Deity, except, the Lion with bald temples and
big belly;<span
id="page_290_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_290_note_dagger.md) and no Veil to
him, except Muḥammed the Just, the Faithful; and no Way to him, except
Selmân the Possessor of power, the Stedfast." And in like manner, there
are the five Solitaries,<span
id="page_290_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_290_note_ddagger.md) and the
twelve Naḳîbs,<span
id="page_290_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_290_note_sect.md) whose names are
made known, according to them, in their detestable books; for they cease
not to proclaim the Lord, the Veil, and the Gate, in every revolution
and period, forever, without end. Also, that the Iblîs of Iblîses was
’Omar Ibn El-Khaṭṭâb,—let God be gracious to him! and that the next in
the rank of Iblîses was Abû Bekr, and then ’Othmân,—let God be gracious
to them, and clear them, and elevate their rank above the sayings of the
Heretics, and the profession of the self-devoting Extravagants! and they
cease not, at any time, to exist, according to what they tell.

   And there are ramifications and subdivisions to their doctrines,
which come back to these fundamental principles mentioned.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

   And this accursed sect has possessed itself of a great part of the
country of Syria, so that they are known, noted, and declare themselves,
as holding this doctrine; and all who have had intercourse with them, of
the government-agents of the Muslims, and their learned men, and of the
common people, also, up to the present time, have verified the state of
the case in respect to them. For, during the time that the heretic
Franks held possession of the country, it was unknown to many, how it
stood with them; but after the days of Islâm came,<span
id="page_291_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_291_note_*.md) the state of the case
in respect to them was discovered, and their departure from the right
way was manifested, and the proof of them was very abundant.

   So then, is it allowed to the Muslim to take a wife from among them,
and is the eating of their sacrifices permitted, while the state of the
case is such? And what is the sentence in respect to the cheese made
from the curdled milk of one of their animals offered in sacrifice? And
what is the sentence in respect to their vessels, and their garments,
also? And is the burying of them among the Muslims allowed, or not? And
is it allowed to employ any of them on the frontiers of the Muslims, and
to entrust them to them? or, on the other hand, is it obligatory upon
the prefect of command<span
id="page_291_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_291_note_dagger.md) to displace
them, and to employ other men, of the trusty Muslims? And does he do
wrong, when he commands to turn them off, and to employ others than
them? or, on the other hand, is it allowed to him to grant delay, in
case this is determined upon? And when he employs them, and afterwards
displaces them, or does not displace them, is it allowed to him to
invest the monies of the Public Treasury on their responsibility? And is
the shedding of the blood of the said Nuṣairîyeh lawful? And is their
property a thing decided upon as free to be taken, or not? And when the
prefect of command makes war upon them, does God,—let him be exalted!
aid him in the extinction of their false doctrine, and in the ejection
of them from the fortresses of the Muslims, and in the warning of the
people of Islâm against intermarrying with them, and eating their
sacrifices, and in the commanding of them <span id="page_292">p.
292</span> to fast, and pray, and in the preventing of them from making
a show of their false religion? And is he who wars with the said
Nuṣairîyeh counted as one who mounts a cavalier? and is his recompense
like the recompense of him who mounts a cavalier on the frontiers, on
the shore of the Sea,<span
id="page_292_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_292_note_*.md) through fear of an
invasion of the Franks? or has this one a greater recompense? And is it
obligatory upon any one who knows the said persons, and their doctrines,
to divulge what they are, and to help to do away with their false
doctrine, and the proclaiming of the Imâm on their part, so that
God,—let him be exalted! may perhaps regard their offspring and their
children as Muslims? or, on the other hand, is it allowed to him to be
unconcerned, and to let things take their course? And what is the
recompense of him who labors assiduously for that, and is zealous for
it, and intent upon it?

   Have they spoken explicitly respecting these things, as assisted, and
aided, and recompensed, if God,—let him be exalted! wills?"

   The answer respecting this, in the hand-writing of the Sheikh Taḳḳy
ed-dîn Ibn Yatmiyeh,—may God,—let him be exalted! be merciful to him!
was as follows: "As for these people, denominated the Nuṣairîyeh, they
and the other classes of the mystical Ḳarâmaṭeh,<span
id="page_292_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_292_note_dagger.md) are more
unbelieving than the Jews and the Christians; nay, more unbelieving than
many idolaters; and the injury which they do to the community of
Muḥammed,—let the divine benediction and peace be to him! is greater
than the injury done by warring infidels, such as the infidels of the
Turks and Franks, and others. For these meet the warring of the Muslims
by affecting to be Shî’ah, while, in reality, they believe not in God,
nor in his Envoy, nor in his Book, nor in any command, nor in any
prohibition, nor in any reward, nor in any penalty, nor in any Garden,
nor in any Fire, nor in any one of the messengers preceding our Prophet
Muḥammed,—let the divine benediction and peace be to him! nor in any of
the former religions; nay, they take up the word of God and his Envoy,
acknowledged among <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> the Muslims, to
allegorize it agreeably to certain things which they are full of,
pretending that they constitute the science of the hidden sense, such as
those mentioned by the inquirer, and others not of this sort. For, as
for them, they have no set limit as to that which they pretend of heresy
respecting the names of the Creator, and his signs,<span
id="page_293_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_293_note_*.md) and of perversion of
the word of God,—let him be exalted! and the word of his Envoy, to the
doing away of its positions, inasmuch as their intention is to deny the
faith and the laws of Islâm, altogether; while at the same time they
hold out that these things have their realities, known to them, which
are such sort of things as the inquirer has mentioned, and such as their
saying that the five prayers are the knowledge of their secrets; and the
prescribed fasting, the concealment of their secrets; and the pilgrimage
to the Ancient House,<span
id="page_293_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_293_note_dagger.md) the visiting
of their sheikhs; and that the two hands of Abû Lahab<span
id="page_293_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_293_note_ddagger.md) were Abû
Bekr and ’Omar,—let God be gracious to them both! and that the Great
Prophet, and the Evident Imâm, was ’Aly Ibn Abû Ṭâlib,—let God be
gracious to him!

   And they are the authors of some well-known charges, and some books
composed, in hostility to Islâm and its people. And so, whenever it is
in their power, they shed the blood of the Muslims, as they put to
death, once upon a time, the pilgrims to Mekkeh, and cast them into
Zemzem, and, once upon a time, took off the Black Stone, which remained
with them a long while, and put to death a multitude which only God,—let
him be exalted! can compute, of the learned men of the Muslims, and
their elders, and their princes, and their troops.<span
id="page_293_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_293_note_sect.md)

   And it is said that they have composed many books, and that what the
inquirer mentions is in them, and other things. And the learned men of
the Muslims have composed books disclosing their secrets, and have
therein made evident the infidelity, and the Zendiḳism,<span
id="page_293_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_293_note_dvert.md) and the heresy,
which they profess, inasmuch as they are herein more <span
id="page_294">p. 294</span> unbelieving than the Jews, or than the
Christians, or than those who worship idols.

   And as for that which the inquirer has mentioned by way of describing
them, it is a little out of the much of that which is known to learned
men, as descriptive of them. And it is, among other things, known among
them, that the Christians possessed themselves of the sea-coasts of
Syria only by means of them, who are always in league with every enemy
to the Muslims, and so were leagued with the Christians against the
Muslims. And one of the greatest of calamities, in their opinion, was
the Muslims coming off superior over the Tâtârs;<span
id="page_294_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_294_note_*.md) and one of the greatest
of their rejoicings was when the Christians,—and reverse is God's
appointment,—possessed themselves of the frontiers of the Muslims, which
ceased not to be under the power of the Muslims, as far as the island of
Cyprus, (conquered by the Muslims in the khalifate of the Prince of the
believers ’Othmân Ibn ’Affân,—let God be gracious to him! which
Mu’âwiyeh, the son of Abû Sufyân,—let God be gracious to them both!
conquered,<span
id="page_294_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_294_note_dagger).md) up to the
middle of the fourth century; when these combattants against God and his
Envoy multiplied on the sea-coasts and elsewhere, and so the Christians
possessed themselves of the sea-board; and afterwards, owing to them,
possessed themselves of the Holy City, and other places. For the
circumstances of the case as respects them were among the most potent
occasions thereof; after which, when God had raised up kings of the
Muslims who warred in the way of God, such as Nûr ed-dîn the martyr, and
Ṣalâḥ-ed-dîn, and their successors, and they had conquered the
sea-coasts from the Christians, and those who were in league with them,
and had also conquered the land of Egypt, they held possession of them
about two hundred years, and were at peace with them and the Christians,
for, until they had conquered the country, the Muslims made war upon
them; <span id="page_295">p. 295</span> and within that period, the call
of Islâm was published in the country of Egypt, and in that of
Syria.<span id="page_295_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_295_note_*.md)

   And they have certain appellations affixed to them among the Muslims.
Sometimes, they are called the Mellâḥeh;<span
id="page_295_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_295_note_dagger.md) and sometimes
they are called the Ḳarâmaṭeh; and sometimes thay are caled
Nâshîyeh;<span
id="page_295_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_295_note_ddagger.md) and
sometimes thay are called the Nuṣairîyeh; and sometimes they are caled
the Ḥaramîyeh;<span
id="page_295_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_295_note_sect.md) and sometimes they
are caled the Muḥammareh.<span
id="page_295_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_295_note_dvert.md) And as for these
names, some of them belong to them in common, and some are peculiar to
some of their classes, just as the name formed from the fourth
conjugation *salama*,<span
id="page_295_fr_para"></span>[¶](#page_295_note_para.md) and that formed
from the fourth conjugation of *amana*,<span
id="page_295_fr_**"></span>[\*\*](#page_295_note_**.md) belongs to the
Muslims in common, while some of them have names peculiar to them,
either by parentage, or by country, or on account of something else."

   And he \[Ibn Yatmiyeh\] comments upon their purposes, at some length,
as follows: "so then, they consist of those who are outwardly
Râfiḍheh,<span
id="page_295_fr_daggerdagger"></span>[††](#page_295_note_daggerdagger.md)
and inwardly pure infidels. And the truth of the matter in respect to
them is, that they believe not in any one of the Prophets and the
Messengers, neither in Nûh, or in Ibrâhîm, nor in Mûsa, nor in ’Îsa, nor
in Muḥammed,—let the divine benediction and peace be to him! nor in any
of the Books of God, sent down from above, neither in the Law, nor in
the Gospel, nor in the Psalms, nor in the Distinguisher. And they do not
maintain that the world had a Creator who created it, nor that there is
any religion of his which he commands, nor that he is provided with any
state of being in which he recompenses men for their actions, other than
the present state. And sometimes, they base their profession of belief
in accordance with the doctrines of the Philosophers, naturalistic, or
deistic, upon that of the Mutaḳashshifeh,<span
id="page_295_fr_ddaggerddagger"></span>[‡‡](#page_295_note_ddaggerddagger.md)
and <span id="page_296">p. 296</span> that of the Magians who worship
fire; and to that add a mingling of Râfiḍhism, and falsify, reporting,
for instance as a tradition handed down from the Prophet,—let the divine
benediction and peace be to him! that he said "The first thing that God
created was the Intelligence, and he said to it, 'Approach,' and it
approached, and he said to it, 'Retire,' and it retired;" and perverting
the Prophet's expressions to such a degree that one of them writes, "The
name of God,—let him be exalted! is on the lower part of his legs."<span
id="page_296_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_296_note_*.md) And they deny what the
Prophets have communicated.

   And the learned men of the Muslims are already agreed that, as for
such as these, intermarriage with them is not allowed, so that a man may
not use one of them as his concubine, nor take one of them as his wife;
and that their sacrifices are not to be partaken of. And, as for cheese
made from their curdled milk, learned men say two things which are well
known, respecting it, as in respect to other curdled milk of a dead
animal, and the curdled milk of the Magians, and the curdled milk of the
Franks, of whom it is said that they do not slay victims for sacrifice.
The doctrine, then, of Abû Ḥanîfeh,—let God be gracious to him!—and I
give praise in making one of the two citations,—is that this cheese is
allowed, because the curdled milk becomes not dead with the death of the
beast, and the impure receptacle in the belly affects it not with a
pollution. And the doctrine of Mâlik and of Esh-Shâfi’y,—and I give
praise in making the other citation,—is that this cheese is impure,
because, in their opinion, the curdled milk is impure, for the milk of a
dead animal and its curdled milk are, in their opinion, impure; and of
whomsoever the sacrifice may not be partaken of; his sacrifice is like a
dead animal. And as for their vessels, and their garments, they are like
the vessels of the Magians, and the garments of the Magians, according
to what is known of the doctrines of the Imâms; and The *The
Ṣaḥîḥ*,<span id="page_296_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_296_note_dagger.md)
on that point, says that "their vessels should not be used, except after
they have been <span id="page_297">p. 297</span> washed; for their
sacrifices are dead animals; and so, of necessity, if any part of what
they cook of their sacrifices reaches those of their vessels which are
made use of, they are thereby polluted." But as for the vessels which
one is not obliged to regard as rendered impure, they may be used
without any washing, such as vessels for milk, in which they leave not
their bouillons, and which they wash before putting milk into them. And
’Omar,—let God be gracious to him! indeed, performed his ablutions with
the jar of a Christian woman, respecting the impurity of which he
doubted; so that he did not judge it to be impure, by doubting. And it
is not allowed to bury them in the burial-places of the Muslims; nor to
pronounce the benediction upon any of them who die. For God,—let him be
exalted! forbade his Prophet,—let the divine benediction and peace be to
him! to pronounce the benediction upon hypocrites, such as ’Abdallah Ibn
Ubeiy, and those about him, who made a show of praying, and alms-giving,
and fasting, and warring on the side of the Muslims, not making openly
any declaration which was at variance with the religion of the Muslims,
but keeping such difference secret. Says God,—let him be exalted! "And
thou mayest not pronounce the benediction upon any one of them who dies,
ever, and thou mayest not preside over his burial; verily, they
disbelieve in God and his Envoy, and die as wicked persons."<span
id="page_297_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_297_note_*.md) How shall it be, then,
with these, who, together with Zendiḳism and hypocrisy, make a show of
infidelity and heresy? And as for the employing of such as these on the
frontiers of the Muslims, and in their fortresses, or among their
troops, that is a great error, equal to one's employing wolves to
pasture sheep. For they are the most treacherous of men toward the
Muslims, and the prefects of their commands, and the most eager of men
for the <span id="page_298">p. 298</span> corruption of the religion of
Islâm and the empire of Muḥammed. And they are worse than the lurker
about in the army; for, as for him who lurks about, he has an aim which
concerns either the commander of the armys or the enemy; while their
aims concern our religion, and its Prophet, and its rites, and its
kings, and its learned men, and its common people, and its people of
note. And they are the most eager of men to entrust the fortresses to
the enemies of the Muslims, and to alienate the troops from the prefect
of command, and to withdraw them from obedience to him. So then, it is
obligatory upon the prefects of commands to displace them from the rolls
of fighting men, whether in a fortress, or elsewhere than in a fortress,
while the harm they do in a fortress is most serious; and that they
employ, instead of them, believing men, who hold to the religion of
Islâm, and the admonition of God, and his Envoy, and the Imâms of the
Muslims. And when they make a show of conversion, respecting that there
is a dispute among learned men. So then, those who admit their
conversion, bind them to the observance of the law of Islâm, and impose
upon them tribute of their effects; and those who admit it not, reject
their ranking as of their class, so that whatever is theirs reverts to
the Public Treasury. But, as for these, whenever they are taken up, they
make a show of conversion, inasmuch as one accommodates his doctrine to
piety and the hiding of what is the case with them; and there are those
among them who are acquainted with their religion, and those who are not
so. So that the way, respecting that, is to look out for what is the
case with them; and that they be not suffered to congregate; and that
they be not empowered to bear arms,—not even if they make a part of the
fighting men; and that they be bound to the observance of the laws of
Islâm, namely, the five prayers, and the reading of the Ḳurân; and that
some one stay among them, who may teach them the religion of Islâm, and
interpose between them and their teachers. And let them be prohibited
from making a part of the cavalry, and of the bearers of arms, and of
those clad in the coats of mail which the fighting men wear; and they
may not stay among the troops, just as neither a Jew nor a Christian may
stay among the troops. And let them be bound to the observance of the
laws of Islâm. <span id="page_299">p. 299</span> And it is not allowed
to anyone to leave them at the extremity of the frontiers.

   This is according to that which God,—let him be exalted! says,
namely, "Do ye regard the giving of water to the pilgrim to Mekkeh, and
the visiting of the Mosque, as ye regard one's believing in God and the
day which is to come, and warring on the side of God? They are not alike
in God's estimation, and God directs not wicked people. Those who
believe, and leave their homes, and war on the side of God, staking
their effects and their lives, are highest in degree in God's esteem;
and as for those, they are those who are saved. Their Lord announces to
them the gladness of mercy from him, and grace; and there are gardens
for them, in which is enduring pleasure, where they shall abide forever.
With God is great recompense."<span
id="page_299_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_299_note_*.md) And God,—glory be to
him! is the Knowing One.

some people among the Northern hordes, which in the thirteenth century

Meaning, probably, Ḥujjahs without manifested Imâms. The document,
referred to in the Introduction, which I have set aside for the present,
teaches that the number of the Imâms is seven, while that of the Ḥujjahs

of the Imâm.

<span id="page_295_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_295_fr_*.md) This statement of
the relations existing between the Nuṣairis and the Christians in Syria,
from the middle of the tenth century of our era down into the fourteenth

God, during his illness; and after he had entered where he was, he asked
him to forgive him, and that he would wrap him for burial in the
covering which was next his body, and would pronounce the benediction
over him. So, after he was dead, he \[the Prophet\] sent his tunic that
he might be wrapt in it for burial, and went out to pronounce the
benediction over him; whereupon the verse came down, etc." See
