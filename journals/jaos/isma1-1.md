## INTRODUCTION.

   S<span class="small">OME</span> time ago, I received from Dr. Henry
W. De Forest, missionary in Syria, an Arabic manuscript of fifty-seven
leaves, consisting of three documents which throw new light upon the
opinions held by the Ismâ’ilis, and other sects of Allegorists, or
Mystics, of Muslim origin. Two of these documents bear marks of being
authoritative with the sects themselves whose views they profess to
represent; while the other, though controversial in its design and
character, is valuable for comparison with them. The history of the
Ismâ’ilis and their branches, of which the Druzes constitute one of the
most important, is, at least in its outlines, sufficiently well known.
But excepting the Druzes, whose books have now for some time been in the
hands of the learned, the opinion of none of them have been definitely
ascertained.<span id="page_259_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_259_note_*.md) Of
the Nuṣairian and Ismâ’ilian documents announced within the last three
years, in France and Germany, as recently discovered, only outlines with
brief extracts, or mere tables of contents, have as yet been
published.<span
id="page_259_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_259_note_dagger.md)

   Under these circumstances, though with some diffidence, I publish the
following translation of two of the documents <span id="page_260">p.
260</span> sent to me by Dr. De Forest, setting one of them aside, for
the present, for fear that I may not have yet fully mastered the system
contained in it. The document set aside consists of two fragments of
what purports to be a conversation between Muḥammed Ibn ’Aly El-Baḳir
and Khâlid Ibn Zeid El-Ju’fy, related by the latter in the form of a
\#\#\#, i. e. Missive, for the purpose of directing certain persons
supposed to have "deviated from the path of rectitude." The former of
the two interlocutors here introduced can be no other, as the
conversation itself shows, than the fifth Imâm of the Ismâ’ilis,
commonly known as El-Bâḳir, a great-grandson of the Khalîfeh ’Aly; the
other, who appears as an inquirer, is not so easily identified, but may
be conjectured to be a descendent of ’Aly, whose father was a brother of
El-Bâḳir.<span id="page_260_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_260_note_*.md) But,
inasmuch as Esh-Shahrastâny informs us that the Shî’ite sects, after the
time of El-Bâḳir, were much disposed "to pass off" their opinions "upon
his followers," and "to refer their origin to him, and to fix them on
him," the question noturally arises, whether we have, in this Missive,
the genuine doctrine of El-Bâḳir, or that of some party availing itself
of his name to give currency to views in reality not his. To judge by
what Esh-Shahrastâny tells us of the opinions of El-Bâḳir, the Missive
in question might be taken as an authentic expression of his mind, for
he here denies, either explicitly, or by implication, each of certain
doctrines which are particularly mentioned by Esh-Shahrastâny as not
actually held by him, and which therefore appear to have been those
oftenest ascribed to him falsely. It is possible, however, that some
party with which he was not so generaly confounded, or perhaps kindred
to his own, may have here used his name without authority. At all
events, this Missive sets forth doctrines different from those
maintained by either of the sects referred to, or represented, in the
other two documents.

   The first portion of the following translation is made from the
controversial document. The original of this is entitled \#\#\# i. e.
*The Attack of the Partizan of Justice*<span
id="page_260_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_260_note_dagger.md) *<span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> upon the party of the Ismâ’ilîyeh, and the
Angry Eye upon the party of the Ḳarâmaṭah*, and is an extract from a
larger work entitled \#\#\# i. e. *The Book of the Open Ways of
Approach* \[*to God,*\] *touching on the Gladdenings of* \[*Divine*\]
*Lenity*. It seems to have been written on the appearance of some
followers of Ḳarmaṭ in the Wâdy Ḥamâh, probably near to Ḥamâh in Syria,
"between Ḥomṣ and Kinnesrîn," as Abulfeda says, who adds that those who
threw off the faith of Islâm, had free range there.<span
id="page_261_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_261_note_*.md) There is no precise
indication of the date of its composition, nor is the name of the author
given. He only calls himself Esh-Shâfi’y, or the Shâfi’ite. This
document consists of three parts. The author begins with eight hundred
and thirty-two lines of rhymed measure, in which he portrays the hated
party against which he writes, in concise and pointed terms. These
rhymings I have passed over in translating, as the fuller statements in
prose which follow them, though less piqutant as a specimen of
controversy, may be more safely relied upon for information. Next is
introduced a piece in prose by another author. This author calls himself
El-Âmidy, and it may be suggested as quite probable that he is the Seif
ed-dîn El-Âmidy whom Ibn Khallikân speaks of as having taken up his
residence at Ḥamâh, and there composed works "on the principles of
religion, and jurisprudence, and logic, and philosophy, and
disputation," and whose death, as the same authority informs took place
A. H. 631, i. e. A. D. 1233-4.<span
id="page_261_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_261_note_dagger.md) It is worthy
of notice, in this connection, that a portion of this piece strikingly
resembles what Von Hammer published many years ago, on the Ismâ’ilis, as
in substance contained in a work by El-Jorjâny,<span
id="page_261_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_261_note_ddagger.md) who,
according to D'Herbelot, died A. H. 816, i. e. A. D. 1413-14.<span
id="page_261_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_261_note_sect.md) The third part of
this document is a statement of inquiries respecting the Nuṣairis,
presented to Taḳḳy ed-dîn Ibn Yatmiyeh, with his answer. This person was
a distinguished doctor of Muslim law, who died, according to D'Herbelot,
A. H. 768, or, as some say, A. H. 748, i. e. A.D. 1366-7, or A. D.
1347-8.<span id="page_261_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_261_note_dvert.md)
<span id="page_262">p. 262</span> It follows from the limitation of date
thus given to the concluding part of this document, that it must have
been compiled as late as the middle of the fourteenth century of our
era. This document was obtained by Rev. Dr. Eli Smith, missionary in
Syria, from Mikhâil Meshâka of Damascus.

   The second portion of the following translation is made from a
document without title, but of which the nature of the contents is
sufficiently evident. It consists of four pieces. The first piece
presents a system of cosmogony; the second, a formula of religious
belief; the third, a mystical allegorizing of the doctrines set forth in
that formula; and the fourth, a statement of the doctrines of the Imâm.
All these pieces are in form declarative, not argumentative; and in
reading them attentively one cannot resist the impression, that they are
specimens of the so-called sermons which the Dâ’is, or missionaries, of
the Ismâ’ilis are said to have been in the habit of delivering, at
stated seasons, in general assemblies of the sect, to those whom they
would initiate into their system.<span
id="page_262_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_262_note_*.md) That they express
Ismâ’ilian doctrine is put beyond doubt by allusions contained in them.
But, what is more, one may even refer some of them, with considerable
confidence, to particular grades of initiation which are described by
oriental writers as recognized by this sect, and are briefly alluded to
in our first document. For the fourth piece evidently belongs to that
stage of instruction of which the object was to impress with the sense
of dependence upon the Imâm; and the third, to that which was designed
to initiate the proselyte into a pretended mystic sense of the doctrines
and precepts of Islâm; while the second might very appropriately have
been delivered to less advanced scholars, by way of "pretension of
agreement with them on the part of the great in religious and worldly
affairs," that is, the leading religious and civil authorities of the
day, or those of the Muslims, which our controversial document charges
upon them as one of their practices. The date of these peculiar
missionary-sermons cannot be exactly determined. But there seems to be
an intimate connection between them all, so that whatever date belongs
to one is probably to be affixed to all. This document, so important for
its contents, was obtained through <span id="page_263">p. 263</span> the
courtesy of Mr. Von Wildenbruch, late Prussian Consul General for Syria,
whose dragoman, Mr. Catafago, found it near Aleppo.

   As a farther introduction to the following translation, are here
added translations of several passages from Esh-Shahrastâny's celebrated
*Book of Creeds and Sects*, relative to the parties to be brought before
the reader. The passage above referred to, in which this author gives an
account of El-Bâḳir, is also appended. It seemed the more desirable to
make these extracts, as no English translation of this high authority on
such subjects is known to have been published, and the German
translation by Haarbrücker, of which the first volume has recently
appeared, although a good one, does not supply the place of one in our
own language.<span id="page_263_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_263_note_*.md) The
first of these extracts relates to the Ismâ’ilis, under the more general
name of the Bâṭinis, which includes also the followers of Ḳarmaṭ and the
Nuṣairis.<span id="page_263_fr_dagger"></span>[†](#page_263_note_dagger.md)
The second is on the Ghâlis, the Extravagant Shî’is, in general.<span
id="page_263_fr_ddagger"></span>[‡](#page_263_note_ddagger.md) The third is
on that particular portion of this party denominated the Nuṣairis and
Isḥâḳis.<span id="page_263_fr_sect"></span>[§](#page_263_note_sect.md) The
fourth relates to El-Bâḳir.<span
id="page_263_fr_dvert"></span>[‖](#page_263_note_dvert.md)

   Exactness has been my aim in translating; and to this every thing
else has been sacrificed, so far as was consistent with preserving the
English idiom. The foot-notes are intended mainly to facilitate the
understanding of the text. A discussion of the many interesting topics
suggested by it, would probably have been premature, if indeed it could
have been entered upon.
