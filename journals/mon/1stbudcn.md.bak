## THE FIRST BUDDHIST COUNCIL.

PREFATORY NOTE.

TEITARO SUZUKI has made, in the present translations, the most valuable
contribution to our knowledge of the First Buddhist Council, which has
appeared in Western nations since Samuel Beal's translation from the
Chinese Dharmagupta document presented by that scholar to the Oriental
Congress at Berlin in 1881, and reprinted in his *Abstract of Four
Lectures* (1882). It is well known to students of the *Sacred Books of
the East* that there is, in the twentieth volume of that series, an
account of the first two Councils of the Buddhist Order, translated from
the Pâli. The account is a later addition to the Minor Section on
Discipline, and we may call it the Council Appendix. It proceeds from
the orthodox and aristocratic School of the Elders, the great rival of
whom was the School of the Great Council (*Mahâsamghika*) who, says the
pilgrim Hsüan-Tsang, admitted to their deliberations the common people,
the foolish and the wise.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>
This being so, it is important for us to know both sides of the story,
indeed as many sides as possible; and this we can do, to some extent, by
reading the different sectarian statements translated by Suzuki. It is
very satisfactory to me, on comparing the one document which he has in
common with Beal (viz., the Dharmagupta) to find that the two Sinologues
substantially agree in their list of the Canonical books.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The Ceylon Chronicles do not admit this sect's existence until the
Second Council.

2\. The only real disagreement is Suzuki's *Itivrittaka* and *Nidâna* in
place of Beal's "good *Nidâna Sûtra*." I sincerely hope Suzuki is right,
for the Pâli *Itivuttaka* is one of the jewels of the Canon.\]

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

   Hermann Oldenberg, in his pioneer essay on the Canon (1879) threw
grave doubts upon the historicity of the First Council, as Suzuki now
reminds us. Rhys Davids, while admitting the doubt, subtracted from its
cogency. ([*S. B. E.*, XI., Introd.](../../bud/sbe11/sbe1102), 1881..md)
For that doubt is based upon the argument from silence, viz: the silence
of the *Decease Book* upon any convocation, while yet reporting the very
speech of Subhadra which, according to the Council Appendix, gave rise
to the Council. But there is another speech in the *Decease Book* which
really requires a Council, or at least a discussion which would
inevitably be decided by authority. It is the speech of Buddha to
Ânanda: "If the Order should so desire, Ânanda, after my demise, let
them abrogate the lesser and minor precepts."

   Now, according to the Council document of the Great Council School,
here translated by Suzuki, this speech did raise a vehement debate, as
indeed how could it fail to? The document agrees with the Pâli account
of the rival sect, that the objectors were overruled by Kassapa the
Great.

   Again, the *Decease Book* also tells us that not only monks and nuns,
but laymen and laywomen, were, at the time of the Master's death,
*bahussutâ*, *dhammadharâ*, full of learning and repositories of the
Dhamma. In the Numerical Collection we find the names of the chief ones
who were thus expert. This ancient list of disciples holds a place in
the Pâli Canon like that of the Christian list in the Third of Mark. Now
the list in the Numerical Collection tells us that *Kaccâna was the
foremost among those who could accurately expand an utterance of the
Master's which had been spoken concisely*. (*Anguttara* I., 14). The
Middling Collection adds that Buddha complimented Kaccâna upon his
ability to do this. (*Majjhima*, No. 18.) The same Nikâya ([No.
84](../jras/1894-14).md) tells us that Kaccâna converted the King of Avanti
after Buddha's decease, and the monarch was ready to take him for his
master. Besides this learned Kaccâna, there was Ânanda learned in the
Suttas, Upâli in the Vinaya; while others, both clerical and lay, were
preachers of the Dhamma, or otherwise expert in points of the great
religion.

   So obviously does this great list of disciples bear upon the First
Council, that the oldest Chronicler of Ceylon gives a poetic <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span> abridgment thereof in his two
accounts;<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> for, like the
Hebrew compilers of the Old Testament, the Ceylon Chronicler is not
content with a composition of his own, but transmits two separate
documents concerning each of the three Councils. These documents
probably emanate from the Great Minster and some other monastery in the
ancient capital of Ceylon.

   There is, in the Pâli Canon, an archaic work, the *Itivuttaka*, which
I venture to call the Buddhist Logia-Book. Each paragraph in this
venerable Gospel-source is attested by the solemn words: "Exactly this
is the meaning of what the Blessed One said, and thus it was heard by
me."<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   Though no names are given, this formula implies that earwitnesses
made depositions as to what they had heard from the Master.

   Another ancient document, the Great Section on Discipline, exhibits a
charming picture of the monks reciting the Master's words even during
his lifetime: on the last night of the yearly residence during the
rains, the reciters sat up late comparing notes and fixing in their
minds the discourses they had chanted together. Another document of the
Discipline, the Minor Section, tells us how the famous disciple Dabba
the Mallian (who could light the monks to bed by emitting magnetic
flames from his fingers) allotted apartments to the different reciters:
the Sutta-reciters and the Vinaya-reciters were housed together. Another
ancient Discipline document, the *Pârâjika*, enumerates Nine Divisions
into which the sacred lore was divided. Three of these divisions,
*Jâtaka*, *Udâna*, *Itivuttaka*, are names of leading books of the Canon
to this day; a fourth one, *Sutta*, is the name of the great fivefold
collection; while three other names enter into the titles of books or
discourses.

   Thus we have reason to believe, from the Canon itself, even in its
oldest documents, that a Council to fix it after Buddha's decease was
inevitable. The monks had been used to hold just such a council every
year through the long decades of his life-work, and

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. *Dîpavamsa* 4 and 5.

2\. Cf. "Gospel Parallels from Pâli Texts," in *The Open Court* for
[January, 1901](../oc/gppt5.htm#page_45.md).\]

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span> they could not have done without one
when he was no more. Again does the *Decease Book* come to our aid:
"Ânanda, the Doctrine and Discipline set forth and laid down by me must,
after my departure, be your Master." And again: "These four great
References, O monks, will I set forth," viz.: that when a monk maintains
a given doctrine to be that of the Buddha, of the Order, of the
reciters, or of some Elder learned in the Âgamas, the Dhamma, the Vinaya
and the Summaries (*Mâtikâ*), it must be compared with the established
Doctrine and Discipline, *line by line and letter by letter*
(*padavyañjanâni*), This implies, according to Western ideas, a written
standard whereto appeal could be made; but many facts brought forward by
Max Müller and Rhys Davids prevent our believing this. The appeal could
only be, therefore, to some established form of the Sacred Lore *as held
by the reciters in their collective capacity*: for, says the text of the
Great References, a monk may be misled by a numerous company of Elders
who are learned in the Âgamas (and so forth, as above). There must
therefore have been *a standing Council on Doctrine and Discipline
during Buddha's lifetime*.

   The later testimony of the Council Appendix affirms that the Elders
of the First Council *revised corruptions of the text*,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> because Buddha had commended it. It had
therefore been done before, doubtless at the yearly meetings aforesaid.
The Council Appendix also gives a hint that more than one recension was
compiled. For, just as Papias, when Peter and John were no more, said
that he preferred the living voice of those who remained who had heard
the Apostles, rather than written records; so, when the monk Purâ.na was
informed that the Elders had recited and fixed the Canon, whereto he was
asked to bow, he politely replied: "Gentlemen, the Doctrine and
Discipline have been beautifully chanted in chorus by the Elders; but,
all the same, I shall maintain what I heard and received from the mouth
of the Blessed One exactly as I heard it."

   Now Purâ.na was the leader of a party of five hundred--a symbolical

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Thus do I translate *khandaphullam patisamkarimsu*, rendered in *S.
B. E.*, XX., p. 373, "they repaired dilapidation."\]

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span> number, meaning a large body; and the
same number is attached to the orthodox party. Therefore, from the
moment of Buddha's death, there were at least two recensions of the
Canon maintained by parties of equal strength. The documents here set
before us by Suzuki plainly proclaim the existence of rival recensions,
agreeing in fundamentals, but differing in arrangement and extent. We
may gather from the Island Chronicle that a favorite bone of contention
was the question: What is text and what is commentary? Accordingly we
find that sharp divergences prevail in those portions of the Canon which
embody commentary: the Short Collection and the Higher Doctrine
(*Khuddaka Nikâya* and *Abhidhamma*).

   Of course, the Canons here given as fixed at the Master's death are
taken by each school from its own recension as it existed when the
account was written; but this does not upset the fact that at least two
such recensions existed from the first, viz., an aristocratic and a
democratic. The first is the School of the Elders and the second the
Great Council. It is true that the latter (the Mahâsamghika) did not
formally secede until the second council, at the end of the first
Buddhist century; but it has long been clear to me that its germ is to
be found in the words of Purâ.no.

   Suzuki's documents are valuable, if nothing else, as lists of the
contents of the different sectarian Canons. It is just such fundamental
documents as these that are in crying need of translation, from
Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. We want to compare the statements of the
conservative school, transmitted to us through the Pâli, with those of
other sects who had other and rival recensions. (Unless we are very
orthodox Theravâdins, we may even call them Canons, in the plural, just
as we should speak of the Greek, Armenian, and Abyssinian Canons of the
Old and New Testaments, which accept or reject the Apocalypses of Enoch
and John.) According to the Tibetans (*teste* Csoma) the Confessional
(and presumably the Scriptures generally) were recited in four different
dialects: Sanskrit, Pâli,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> and
two more.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The name Pâli is not used, but from the names of the Ceylon sects
who used the dialect called "the vernacular," we know that Pâli is
meant.\]

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

   Let us hope that Teitaro Suzuki will go on adding to our knowledge in
the same useful way.

THE FIRST CONVOCATION OF BUDDHISM.

   The purpose of the present article is not to enter into an historical
or critical examination of the First Convocation of the Buddhist Order,
which is generaily admitted by all the schools of Buddhism to have taken
place immediately after the death of the Master. Though, some critics,
for instance, Oldenberg, doubts its historical reality, it is apparently
natural that the pious disciples of Buddha wished to rescue all his
teachings from oblivion as soon as an opportunity presented itself. It
may not, of course, have taken place in all its details as told by
different sects, but even then those records possess an important
historical significance on account of the light which they throw on the
later development of Buddhism. Having this in view, I have collected and
compared as many materials as available from the Chinese sources, but
have refrained from giving an entire translation of them, which, however
interesting to the specialist, cannot be presented in a limited space.
The following summarised notes may serve in giving some insight into the
nature of the First Convocation as well as into the attitude assumed
towards it by different schools of Buddhism.

well, but I have refrained from making extracts from these works,
because good English and French translations are accessible to the
students of Buddhism.

 

CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED KÂÇAYAPA TO SUMMON THE FIRST CONVOCATION.

   That Mahâkâçyapa, the first Buddhist patriarch, was the originator of
the first assembly for compiling the Pitakas, is a matter of general
acceptance by all schools of Buddhism. His motive, according to the
Ceylon tradition, is ascribed to the imprudent utterance of a certain
Bhikshu Subhadra<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> who, hearing
of Buddh'a's entrance into Nirvâna, unreservedly gave vent to his
feeling of relief, for he thought the religious discipline demanded by
his Master was too rigorous. This tradition agrees with the records in
the Vinaya texts of the Mahîçâsaka, the Mahâsa.nghika, and the
Dharmagupta schools, and also with those in the Vinaya-mâtrikâ-Sûtra and
the Sudarçana-Vinaya-vibhâshâ,<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> whereas in the Vinaya text of the
Dharmagupta an additional reason why the Pitaka should be rehearsed
immediately after Buddha's death is given by Kâçyapa thus: "We should
now compile<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> the Dharma and
the Vinaya, in order that heretics (tîrthakas) shall not make us \[the
subject of\] superfluous comments and censures, saying that the
discipline of the Çrâma.na Gautama is like smoke; that when the
World-honored One was living, all \[his disciples\] observed the
precepts, but now, after his disappearance, there are none who observe
them."

   But the Vinaya text of the Sarvâstivâda, Transmission of the
Dharmapitaka and the Mahâprajñâpâramitâ Çâstra do not make any allusion
to the unwise Bhikshu. The Sarvâstivâda-vinaya, the Mahâprajñâpâramitâ
Çâstra, and the Life of Açoka, on the other

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. This monk Subhadra should not be confounded with Buddha's last
convert, who happens to bear the same name.

2 The name of the imprudent Bhikshu is Bhânanda in the Mahîçâsaka, the
Dharmagupta, and the Vinaya-mâtrikâ; Mahallaka in the Mahâsanghika;
Subhadra-Mahallaka in the Sudarçana-vibhâsbâ-Vinaya.

3\. *Chieh chi*. Literally, *chieh* means to tie, to join, or to unite,
and *chi* to gather, to collect, to compile, and the like. The term is
apparently an equivalent of *samgîti*, but I have retained its Chinese
sense by translating it "compilation."\]

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span> hand, state that Mahâkâçyapa was
requested or instigated by devas who deeply lamented the possibility of
the future loss of the Pitakas, if not compiled in due time. The
Transmission of the Dharmapitaka, however, says nothing about the
superhuman suggestion. To quote the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya: "Those devas
whose long life extends over many kalpas were greatly afflicted at
witnessing the Nirvâna of Buddha. But when they came to observe that
many a sage had also entered into Nirvâna, they at last began to blame
\[the disciples\], saying: 'The Sûtra, Vinaya, and Mâtrikâ \[which
constitute\] the genuine Dharmapitaka taught by the World-honored One
are left uncompiled; but surely \[the disciples\] are not going to have
the right doctrine turned into ashes?'"

   Surmising the wish of those devas, Mahâkâçyapa said to all Bhikshus:
"You know that the venerable Çâriputra and the venerable
Mahâmaudgalyâyana, each with a large number of great Bhikshus who could
not bear witnessing Buddha's entrance into Mahânirvâna, had already
reverted to a state of perfect tranquillity; and now the World-honored
One himself, in turn with 18,000 Bhikshus, has also entered into
Parinirvâna. All those devas who are living innumerable kalpas, however,
come forth to express their deep grief, and blame us, saying: 'Why do
you not have the holy teachings of the Tripitaka compiled? Are you going
to have the deepest spiritual doctrine of the Tathâgata turned into
ashes?' So I declare to you all that the greatest thing we can do now is
the compilation of the Pitaka. All then responded: 'Well, let us do the
work.'"

   In the Transmission of the Dharmapitaka, Mahâkâçyapa is stated to
have told all Bhikshus, as follows: "Buddha is now cremated, but we have
no concern with the relics (çârîra) of the World-honored One, for kings,
the rich, ministers of state, and lay-believers who desire the most
excellent bliss will, of their own accord, make offerings \[to them\].
What we have to do is the collection of the Dharmacakshu \[literally,
the eye of the law\], whereby to prevent an untimely extinction of the
torch of the law. ln order that it may illuminate the future generation,
let a prosperous perpetuation of the Triratna be not interrupted."

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

   The Record of the Collection of the Tripitaka and the Samyuktapitaka,
which was translated during the Eastern Tsin dynasty, A.D. 317-420,
agrees with the above-mentioned work in referring neither to the
imprudent Bhikshu nor to the suggestion of devas.

 

THE EXCLUSION OF ÂNANDA.

   It is almost<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> unanimously
recorded in all the Chinese books that Ânanda was not admitted to
membership in the Convocation, until he attained to the state of
mastery, through the reprimand of Mahâkâçyapa, which successfully
awakened in his heart the feelings of deep remorse and shame. There is,
however, no agreement of statements as to how Ânanda was instigated by
him in obtaining final emancipation.

   According to The Sudarçana-vibhâshâ-vinaya, Mahâkâçyapa insisted on
the exclusion of Ânanda from the Convocation in order to protect it
against all the reprehension that might arise from admitting one who was
still in the stage of training; but the rest of the congregation thought
it impossible to compile the Sûtras without Ânanda, so they admonished
him to exert all his spiritual powers for the attainment of Arhatship.

   The Life of Açoka, the Caturvarga-vinaya of the Dharmagupta school,
and the Pañcavarga-vinaya of the Mahîçâsaka school, these three works
generally agree in this connection. Ânanda was preaching the Law to a
large crowd of people, not knowing anything about Mahâkâçyapa's
determination to exclude him from the meeting. A certain Bhikshu named
Po-she,<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> who perceived through
his supernatural insight that Ânanda was not yet free from attachment,
felt pity for him, and told him the following in verse:

<table data-align="center">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>"Calmly sitting under a tree, contemplate Nirvâna.<br />
Be not indolent, but exercise Dhyâna.<br />
For what good would there be in chattering?"</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Except the Transmission of the Dharmapitaka, where no mention is
made of this incident.

2\. So in the Caturvarga-vinaya, but Po-ch'i in the Pañcavarga-vinaya,
and Po-shê-fu-to, as a disciple of Ânanda, in the Life of Açoka. It is
very difficult to find the Sanskrit equivalents of those names when
their meanings are not given, for there is a tendency among the
so-called "old translators" to simplify long Sanskrit terms in such a
manner as to make them appear like native Chinese names.\]

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

   Thereupon Ânanda made up his mind to obtain final emancipation, etc.,
etc.

   In the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya, a verse slightly different in meaning
from the above is also mentioned, but it was given by a mysterious boy
who served him as an attendant, instead of by a Bhikshu. This incident
occurred after a severe censure by Mahâkâçyapa of eight misdemeanors
committed by Ânanda. The Vinaya text states that Mahâkâçyapa at first
considered what would be the proper way of treating Ânanda, whether with
a severe reprehension or with a gentle encouragement. When he had
determined to take the first course, Ânanda was brought before the
congregation. Mahâkâçyapa said: "You must leave this place. \[It is not
proper for\] this congregation of worthy \[Bhikshus\] to be associated
with you in their work." Hearing this, Ânanda felt as if his heart were
being pierced with arrows, and, trembling all over his body, he pleaded
with Mahâkâçyapa not to exclude him from the congregation, as he was not
conscious of any faults \[which would justify this severe punishment\]
Mahâkâçyapa now enumerated his eight misdemeanors, which caused Ânanda
at last to retire from the assembly and to train himself for the
attainment of Arhatship.

   In the Mahâsanghika-vinaya, Ânanda is stated to have received a very
humiliating treatment from Mahâkâçyapa. When Mahâkâçyapa was requested
by Bhikshus to admit the former to their assembly, he said: "No, if such
a one \[who is still in the stage\] of training should be admitted into
a congregation of those who are above training and are perfect in their
meritorious powers, he would appear like a leprous fox (?) in an
assemblage of lions." When this ignominious comparison was communicated
by a deva to Ânanda, who was travelling towards Râjagriha, it did not
please him at all. But he thought that Mahâkâçyapa who well knew to what
family he belonged, would not have referred to him in such a way, if he
were free from prejudices. But in the meantime having attained final
deliverance, Ânanda hastened through the air to the Convocation.
Mahâkâçyapa, it is stated, then explained to him that he used such a
vigorous expression, only as he wished to encourage him to reach the
stage of Arhatship.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

   In the Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ-Çâstra, the episode is described somewhat
in a similar way to that in the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya. Ânanda is brought
before the congregation by Mahâkâçyapa, and is reproached first for his
not being yet qualified to rejoin it, and then for his six (not eight)
misdemeanors. When Ânanda is expelled from the assembly, Mahâkâçyapa
closes the gate behind him, and begins to compile the Vinaya with the
remaining Bhikshus. Exceedingly mortified, Ânanda during the night
exercised all his spiritual powers to reach the Path, and when at last
he attained to the state of freedom from all prejudices, he rushed at
midnight to Mahâkâçyapa's gates. Being told there to come inside through
the keyhole, he did so by his supernatural power. Mahâkâçyapa consoled
him, saying that the severe reproach had been inflicted upon him simply
because he wished to see him enter into the state of Arhatship.

   In the Sûtra on Kâçyapa's Compilation \[of the Tripitaka\] Ânanda is
said to have been expelled from the congregation after he was censured
by Mahâkâçyapa for his nine misdemeanors in the presence of the Samgha.

 

ÂNANDA'S MISDEMEANORS.

   When Ânanda said to Mahâkâçyapa that he was not conscious of any
faults, and that therefore there was no reason to exclude him from the
assembly, Mahâkâçyapa enumerated several of his (duskrita), which were
considered by him to be the proof that Ânanda was still in the stage of
training. This incident is said to have occurred, according to some,
before the compilation, but according to others, after it. To the former
belong the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya, the Sûtra on Kâçyapa's compilation, the
Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ-Çâstra, and the Caturvarga-vinaya of the
Dharmagupta school; to the latter belong the Vinayamâtrikâ Sûtra, the
Pañcavarga-vinaya of the Mahîçâsaka, the Life of Açoka, and the
Mahâ-samghika-vinaya. But in the Caturvarga-vinaya, the
Mahâsamghika-vinaya,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> the Life
of Açoka, the Pañcavarga-vinaya, the faults

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Here the accuser is not Mahâkâçyapa, but Upâli.\]

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span> of Ânanda are simply enumerated
without any reference to his qualification as a member of the
Convocation.

   The number of his faults as censured by Mahâkâçyapa or Upâli is
variously estimated at six, seven, eight, and nine. The following sums
up all that was charged against him:

   1. Ânanda asked Buddha for the admittance of women into the Samgha,
in spite of Buddha's prediction that if women were admitted, the Law of
the Tathâgata would not long abide on earth.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   2. Ânanda did not ask Buddha for the prolongation of his life, when
the latter expressly suggested this to him, by saying that those who
were trained in the four supernatural powers could either prolong or
shorten their life for the period of one kalpa.

   3. When Buddha preached in parables, Ânanda made, in spite of his
presence, some superfluous remark on them.

   4. Ânanda trod on Buddha's golden-colored robe while trying to wash
it (*a*), or while trying to sew it (*b*).

   5. Being asked by Buddha to give him some water when he was going to
enter into Nirvâna, Ânanda gave him muddy water (*a*), or he did not
give him any, even when thrice asked (*b*).

   6. When Buddha told Ânanda that Bhikshus might dispense with minor
precepts, he did not make any inquiry as to what precepts should be
regarded minor.<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   7. Ânanda exposed the secret parts of Buddha in the presence of
women, thinking that the act would tend to the cessation of their
passions, but how could he know this when he had not yet attained to the
stage of Arhatship?

   8. Ânanda showed the gold-colored body of Buddha to a multitude of
women, allowing them to defile it with their tears.

   9. Ânanda first allowed women to worship the remains of Buddha.

   10. When Ânanda was one time reproached by Buddha, he secretly
cherished ill-will, and was mischievous to others.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Most of the Chinese books here referred to give all the reasons by
which Ânanda justified himself for having committed those alleged
misdemeanors, but from want of space, no mention here is made of them.

2\. This naturally caused a vehement demonstration among the Samgha
later.\]

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

   11. Ânanda was not yet free from the three evil passions: lust,
malice, and ignorance, while all the other Bhikshus assembled in the
Convocation were free therefrom.

   12. Buddha asked Ânanda three times to serve him as one who offers
things (?) to Buddha, but he declined it.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   The number and the order of these faults committed by Ânanda are
different in different works.

   In the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya eight faults are counted in the following
order: 1, 2, 3, 4*a*, 5*a*, 6, 7, 8.

   The Pañcavarga-vinaya counts six in this order: 6, 4*b*, 1, 2, 5*b*,
9.

   The Life of Açoka, six: 6, 5*b*, 4 (simply stepping on Buddha's
robe), 2, 7 (the reason given by Ânanda is that he wished to awake in
the minds of women the desire to be born as men in their future life),
1.

   The Sûtra on Kâçyapa's Compilation has nine: 1, 2, 10, 4 (simply
stepping over the golden robe of Buddha), 5*b*, 6, 7, 8, 11.

   The Caturvarga-vinaya states seven: 1, 12, 4*b*, 2, 5*b*, 6, 8.

   The Mahâsamghika-vinaya describes seven, thus: 1, 2, 4*b*, 5*b*, 6,
7, 8.

   The Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra has six: 1, 5*b*,<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> 2, 4 (when folding), 7.

   The Vinaya-mâtrikâ Sûtra merely states that Mahâkâçyapa accused
Ânanda for his seven faults, but does not particularise any of them: on
the other hand it relates nine disadvantages arising from the admittance
of women into the Samgha.

   It is significant that the Sudarçana-vinaya does not make any
reference to Ânanda's misdemeanors.

 

THE INCIDENT OF GAVÂMPATI.

   The incident of Gavâmpati in connection with the First Convocation is
stated in all the Mahâyâna literature and also in some<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Note how trifling all these accusations are.

2\. The fault is viewed here from two points: (1) not giving any water,
(2) not knowing the fact that Buddha is able to cleanse any kind of
water .

3\. That is, the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya and the Mahâsamghika-vinaya.\]

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span> of the Hînayâna. In the Mahâyâna
literature we have the following works: The Life of Açoka, the
Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra, the Sûtra concerning Kâçyapa's Compilation,
the Record of the Transmission of the Dharmapitaka, and the Record of
the Compilation of the Tripitaka and the Samyuktapitaka. On the other
hand, the Vinaya-mâtrikâ Sûtra, the Caturvarga-vinaya, the
Pañcavarga-vinaya, and the Sudarçana-vinaya, all of which belong to
documents of the Hînayâna class, make no statement about the Gavâmpati
incident.

   The incident of Gavâmpati, though it is more or less differently
recorded as to its details in different works, is briefly this. Hearing
the great bell rung by Mahâkâçyapa, the five hundred Bhikshus<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> hastened to the place of meeting, but
when Mahâkâçyapa found that one of them<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> called Gavâmpati<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> had not yet joined them, he asked
Anuruddha of the whereabouts of the missing Bhikshu. Being told that he
was enjoying a peaceful life in one of the Heavens,<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> he sent a message thither to invite him
to the convocation presided over by Mahâkâçyapa. Gavâmpati, who knew
nothing about the late events relating to Buddha and his disciples,
scrutinisingly asked the messenger why Mahâkâçyapa, instead of the
Blessed One himself, stood at the head of the congregation: what was the
object of such a grand religious convention, and some other
questions.<sup><span class="small">\[5\]</span></sup> When he was
informed of all that had been going on below, he was so greatly
afflicted that he said he had now no inclination to descend to the
earth, which was made entirely desolate by the eternal departure of
Buddha. So saying, Gavâmpati entered into a state of deep meditation,
suddenly rose in the air

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The number of the Bhikshus who took part in the First Convocation
is generally estimated at five hundred, but according to the
Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra, the Convocation consisted of one thousand
Bhikshus.

2\. According to the Mahâsamghika, two Bhikshus were missing when the
members were counted by Kâçyapa, but one of them, Anuruddha, soon joined
them.

3\. The Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra makes him a disciple of Çâriputra.

4\. According to some, the Çrîvriksha (?) palace, but according to
others the Çrîdeva palace.

5\. So in the Sarvâstivâda-vinaya.\]

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span> shining with supernatural brilliancy,
and then consumed himself in a heavenly fire.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   The Mahâ-prajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra says that Gavâmpati having been fully
familiar with the Vinaya and the Sûtra, his presence was necessary to
the assembly.

   According to the Mahâsamghika-vinaya, Mahâkâçyapa sent several
messages to Heaven to summon those Bhikshus who were abiding there, but
all of them, having learned that Buddha had already entered into
Parinirvâna, were so exceedingly mortified that they disappeared one
after another in the same manner. Mahâkâçyapa then declared that no more
messages would be despatched to Heaven, nor should those Bhikshus who
were living on earth enter into Nirvâna until their work of great
importance had been completed.

 

THE PROCEEDINGS.

   What was done by the Convocation? Were the Vinayapitaka and the
Sûtrapitaka alone compiled? Did a compilation of the Abhidharmapitaka
also take place? Did any dissension occur in the assembly? These
questions constitute the most important part of the First Convocation,
and the following abstracts from various Chinese translations are
calculated to throw some light on them.

   *A. The Vinaya in Four Divisions* (*Caturvarga-vinaya*).--When the
cremation ceremony of Buddha was over, all the five hundred Bhikshus
went from Vaiçâli to Râjagriha, where Mahâkâçyapa intended to summon the
assembly. First, Ânanda was blamed for his seven faults, as already
mentioned; then Upâli was requested to recite the Vinaya, beginning with
the first of the Principal Sins (Pârâjika), as to the individual, the
circumstance, and the nature of the crime. Rules concerning the Bhikshu
and the Bhikshuni, the Prâ.timoksha, the Poshadha, the Residing Season,
the Wandering Season, the use of leather, the robes, medicaments, the
Ka.thina ceremonies,--all these regulations were incorporated in the
Vinaya.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The Sarvâstivâda-vinaya, the Mahâprajñâ-pâramitâ Çâstra, and the
Sûtra on Kâçyapa's Compilation relate, in addition, that four streams
ran out of his transfigured body, each murmuring a gâthâ which
proclaimed the transiency of life and the lamentable departure of the
Lord.\]

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

   Ânanda was next asked to compile the Sûtrapitaka. Such Sûtras as the
Brahma-jâla (translated Brahma-moving), the Ekottara (increasing by
one), the Daçottara (increasing by ten), the Formation and Destruction
of the World, the Sa.ngîti (chorus), the Mahânidâna (great cause), the
Questions of the Çakradeva (Indra), were included in the Longer Âgama
(Pâli, Dîgha Nikâyo); those Sûtras of middle length were called the
Middling Âgama (Pâli, Majjhima Nikâyo); those in which the subjects were
arranged numerically from one to eleven were called the Âgama Increasing
by One (A.nguttara Nikâyo); those which were miscellaneously preached
for (?) the Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upâsakas, Upâsikâs, Devas, Çakra,
Mâras, and Brâhmarâjas, were called the Miscellaneous Âgama (Samyutta
Nikâyo); and lastly such Sûtras as the Jâtaka, Itivrittika,<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> Nidâna, Vaipulya, Adbhûta, Avadâna,
Upadeça, the Explanation of Aphorisms (Nirdeça?), Dharmapada,
Pârâyana,<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> Miscellaneous
Discussions and several Gâthâs, were comprised in the Miscellaneous
Pitaka, (Pâli, Khuddaka Nikâyo, with other matter). The Discursive
\[Book\] (Kathâ Vatthu),<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> the
Non-discursive \[Book\] (Vibha.nga or Puggala paññati?), the Yoking
(Dhamma Sanga.ni?), the Correlating (Yamaka?), and the Place of Birth
(Pa.t.thâna?) made up the Abhidharmapitaka.<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup>

   *B. The Vinaya in Five Divisions* (*Pañcavarga-vinaya*).--When the
five hundred Bhikshus were assembled in Râjagriha, Mahâkâçyapa inquired
of Upâli in due formulary of the four Principal Precepts (Pârâjika) as
to the place where they were occasioned, as to the individual with whom
they were concerned, and as to the matter with which they dealt. All the
Vinaya, for the Bhikshus as well as for the Bhikshunis, was compiled in
this way.

   Mahâkâçyapa then asked Ânanda where Buddha taught the Ekôttara Sûtra,
the Daçôttara Sûtra, the Mahânidâna Sûtra, the

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Not given by Beal.

2\. Beal gives the Anâgata-Bhayâni and Munigâthâ.

3\. This and following four titles are so concisely given in the text
that it is very difficult to make out what they are, and the translation
and the reference to the Pâli Abhidharma works here presented are merely
tentative.

4\. The text is reticent about the author of the compilation of this
Pitaka.\]

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span> Samgiti Sûtra, the Çrâmañaphala Sûtra,
the Brahmajâla (translated Brahmâ-moving), as well as those Sûtras which
were preached to Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, Upâsakas, Upâsikâs, Devapûtras,
and Devis. When all the Sûtras were thus recited, Mahâkâçyapa declared
to the Samgha: "Those longer Sûtras which are now compiled in one group
shall be called the Longer Âgama; those Sûtras which are neither long
nor short, and are now compiled in one group, shall be called the
Middling Âgama; those which are miscellaneously preached to Bhikshus,
Bhikshunis, Upâsakas, Upâsikâs, Devapûtras, and Devis, and are now
compiled in one group, shall be called the Miscellaneous Âgama; those
Sûtras which start with one dharma and increase by one, up to eleven
dharmas, and are now compiled in one group, shall be called the Âgama
Increasing by One; while the remainder, all consisting of miscellaneous
teaching, and now compiled in one group, shall be called the
Miscellaneous Pitaka. And to them all shall be given a collective name,
Sûtrapitaka. We have now finished compiling the Law, and henceforth let
us not put any unnecessary restraint on what was not restrained by
Buddha; let us not violate what has already been restrained by Buddha;
let us sincerely train ourselves according to the teachings of Buddha."

   *C. The Vinaya-mâtrikâ Sûtra*.--Ânanda being admitted to join the
assembly, and the five hundred Arhats having taken their seats, they
began to compile the Tripitaka out of the materials which consisted of
Sûtras in five or five hundred<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> divisions. Rules for the Bhikshu and
Bhikshuni, and the Skandhas (divisions) relating to the Ka.thina and
other things composed the Vinayapitaka. The four Âgamas, (1) Long, (2)
Middling, (3) Increasing by One, and (4) Miscellaneous--the last one
consisting of those Sûtras which relate to Bhikshus, Bhikshunis, the
Çakrendra, devas, and Brâhmarâjâs, as well as (5) the sundry collection
which comprised the Dharmapada, the Exposition, the Pârâyana, the
Upadeça and others,--these five groups of the Sûtras were classified
under the Sûtrapitaka. The Discursive (or Dialogical) Treatise (Kathâ
vatthu?),

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. According to other editions.\]

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span> the Non-discursive (or Non-dialogical)
Treatise (Vibhanga?), the Mutual Enclosing (Dharma Sanga.ni?), the
Correlating (Yamaka?), and the Regions (Dhâtu Kathâ or
Patthâna?)<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> made up the
Abhidharmapitaka. And the general name Tripitaka was given to them all.

*D. The Vinaya Text of the Sarvâstivâda School*.--Mahâkâçyapa and the
five hundred Bhikshus kept the assembly in the Pippâla Cave. He
announced that as Bhikshus in coming generations would be inferior in
their natural endowment (literally, root, mûla?) and lacking in the
power of concentration, the assembly would first compile, for the sake
of such, the Gâthâs (verses)<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>
in which the Sûtra, Vinaya and Abhidharma<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> were treated in comprehensive brevity.
This was done before the meal. They then proceeded to compile the
Sûtras. Ânanda was requested by Mahâkâçyapa as well as by the Samgha to
select and compile them. Having gone through due formality and having
reflected on the impermanence of things, he thought: "Among those Sûtras
which I heard personally from Buddha, some are traditional,<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> some are preachings in the Nâga
(Serpent) Palace,<sup><span class="small">\[5\]</span></sup> others are
preachings in the heavens. <span class="small"></span>

\[1. Those five titles of the books contained in the Abhidharmapitaka
closely agree, though the translation is a little different, with those
above referred to in the Vinaya in Five Divisions, but the terms being
too concise, we cannot give anything more than a mere conjecture as to
their correspondence to the Pâli works.

2\. Was the Gâthâ already existing side by side with the prose at the
time of the First Convocation? Did Buddha himself put some most
important tenets of his doctrine into a rhythmical form, that his
disciples might learn them by heart? (Yes: See *S. B. E.*, XIII., p.
151.--Edmunds.)

3\. Were some parts of the Abhidharma also versified?

4\. Does this mean that Buddha preached on some traditional subjects, or
that some Sûtras deal with traditions, or that the first sermons of
Buddha, such as were delivered for the five Bhikshus in Vârânasî before
the conversion of Ânanda, were heard by him afterwards from Buddha's own
mouth, or from those who were then present, in which case the term
tradition would be used in the sense of hearsay? Judging from similar
passages in some other works, the last sense seems to be most
preferable.

5 This statement is most significant, for many Mahâyâna texts are said
to have been taken from the Nâga Palace where they were long preserved
in secret. The Vinaya text of the Sarvâstivâda is generally considered
to belong to the Hînayâna work, and this fact makes the above statement
much more mysterious. Is the Nâga Palace an ideal creation of later
Buddhists? or is it some yet unknown region in the Himâlaya? \[Buddha
converted several yakkhas, nâgas, etc.--Edmunds.\]\]

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span> As I keep them all in memory and do
not forget any of them, I shall now recite them." All Devas expressed
their willingness to listen, and Mahâkâçyapa praised the words of Buddha
as the foremost of all doctrines.

   Ânanda then recited the first Sûtra, the Dharmaçakrapravartana
(Revolution of the Law-wheel), which was taught in Benâres for the five
Bhikshus, one of whom, Ajñâta Kau.n.di.nya, being present in the
assembly, told Mahâkâçyapa how at that time he gained the eye of the
Law. Hearing this, devas as well as those Bhikshus who were not yet
freed from attachment,<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>
uttered a pitiful cry as if their hearts were being pierced with
thousands of arrows, and lamented that they could not hear those words
of Buddha any more from his own mouth. In this lamentation the Bhikshus
of the assembly also joined. When they recovered from the shock of deep
feeling, Mahâkâçyapa declared that this first Sûtra, taught by the
Blessed One, having been accepted by all, should be recognised as the
genuine doctrine of Buddha.

   The second Sûtra, Ânanda now went on, which was also preached in
Benâres for the sake of the five Bhikshus, consisted in the elucidation
of the Four Noble Truths and the Eight Right Paths. Kau.n.di.nya's
confirmation and Mahâkâçyapa's conclusion were declared as before.

   The occasion which induced Buddha to preach the third Sûtra was also
in Benâres for the sake of the five Bhikshus. He taught that the five
Skandhas (aggregates) have no Âtman, that they are subject to
transformation, that they cause misery, that one can save oneself from
misery through a right comprehension of the nature of things. The
conclusion of Mahâkâçyapa was the same as before.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. This is very strange, considering that those who were admitted to
the assembly were all free from attachment, that is, they were all
Arhats; but in spite of this were many other Bhikshus also admitted as
the audience, though not actually partaking in the work of the
compilation of the Tripitaka? In the Mahâyâna work a statement is
sometimes made to the effect that the followers of the Mahâyâna Buddhism
had their own convocation somewhere in the neighborhood. Does the
present text refer to this, or to the council of the Mahâsanghika school
as it is mentioned in Hsüan-Tsang?\]

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

   In this way all the other Sûtras taught by Buddha in several places
were recited by Ânanda and confirmed by the Arhats of the assembly. They
were all classified in proper forms according to the subject: for
example, Sûtras which treated the five Skandhas were grouped under the
heading of Skandha, those which treated the six Âyatanas or the eighteen
Dhâtus were classified under the Âyatana or Dhâtu; and so on with the
(twelve) Chains of Causation, the (four) Noble Truths, the speeches of
Çrâvakas, the speeches of Buddha, the (four) subjects of Recollection,
the (four kinds of) Right Effort, the (four) Supernatural Powers, the
(five) Indriyas, the (five) Balas, and the (eight) Bodhyangas.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   Those Sûtras which are in coincidence with the Gâthâs (verse parts),
were called the Coincidence<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>
Âgama; those which consist of lengthy teachings, the Longer Âgama; those
which are of medium length, the Middling Âgama; those in which the
subjects are numerically arranged, the Âgama Increasing by One. "There
are," says Mahâkâçyapa, "no other Âgamas than these" now compiled.

   Next, the Convocation proceeded to compile the Vinaya, led by Upâli,
who was considered by Buddha to be the first of the
Vinaya-dharâ.<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> Being asked by
Mahâkâçyapa where, to whom, and on what the first rule of propriety,
(Çikshâ)<sup><span class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> was announced by
Buddha, Upâli said that it was in Vârâ.nasi (Benâres) and for the five
Bhikshus, and that the matter related to the arrangement of

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. These subjects also appear in the Abhidharmapitaka, as we see
below. Do the statements mean that those subjects as taught by Buddha
were classified with the Sûtrapitaka, while a further exposition of the
same by his disciples was included in the Abhidharma?

2\. Samyukta in Sanskrit. *Coincidence* is a literal translation of it,
which is commonly rendered *miscellaneous*, according to its derived
meaning--so says the text.

3\. Literally, those who carry the Vinaya, i.e. , know it by heart.

4\. It is very strange that Mahâkâçyapa did not first ask Upâli about
the four Principal Sins (Pârâjika), instead of about such insignificant
regulations as the Çikshâ rules. Why does the Sarvâstivâda school attach
such importance to the latter, while other schools invariably give the
first place to the Pârâjika, as is naturally expected? Noticing,
however, the in consistent statement which is made immediately below, I
am inclined to think that some spurious elements have crept later into
the body of the original text.\]

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span> the undergarment. The second Çikshâ
was recited by him in the same way.

   As for the third Çikshâ, the text continues as follows:<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> "Mahâkâçyapa again said to Upâli: Where
did the World-Honored One announce the Çikshâ? Upâli replied with a
clear, penetrating voice: In Kala.n.daka Village.--For whom?--For
Bhikshu Sudinna, son of Kala.n.daka.--What was the matter? If a Bhikshu
training himself in the disciplinary rules, commits an adulterous act
with another Bhikshu or with an animal, he performs a Pârâjika fault;
nor is he allowed to cohabit."<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   In this way all the parts of the Vinaya were compiled, which consist
of the Pârâjika rules, Samghâvaçesa rules, two Aniyata rules, thirty
Naissargika rules, ninety Prâyaçcittika rules, four Pratideçanîya rules,
a number of Çikshâ rules, seven Adhikara.naçamatha, as well as the
principal rules, obligatory rules, voluntary rules, rules for the
Bhikshu, rules for the Upâsaka, regulations of the Karmavâca, conditions
for conversion, the Poshadha, the season of residence, the wandering
season, general and miscellaneous regulations, and the circumstances
which brought forth all these rules and regulations.

   The compilation of the Vinaya being thus finished, it now occurred to
Mahâkâçyapa that, as the people in coming generations would be so
lacking in intelligence and so poor in natural endowment that they could
not comprehend the deep significance of the Doctrine by studying the
text only, he himself would recite the Mâtrikâ,<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup> that is, Abhidharma, whereby to prevent
the spirit of the Sûtra and the Vinaya from being obliterated by
arbitrary interpretations. Having obtained the sanction of the
Convocation, he comprised under the Mâtrikâ the following subjects: the
four Objects of Smriti (recollections), the four Right Efforts, the four
Supernatural

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The following quotation clearly shows how confusing the text is:
"Upâli was asked to recite the third Çikshâ, and is stated to have told
them about the first Pârâjika instead." As I remarked just above, the
text must be considered to contain some later additions.

2\. Literally, to live together.

3\. Originally tables of contents, as may be seen in the Pâli
texts.--A.J.E.\]

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span> Powers (Riddhi), the five Indriyas
(lit. root), the five Powers (Bala), the seven Bodhyangas (constituent
parts of enlightenment), the Eightfold Noble Path, the four Abhayas
(fearlessness), the four Pratisamvids (unimpeded knowledge), the four
Çrâmanaphala (obtainment of Çrama.naship), the four Dharmapadas, the
Ârañya (solitude), Wish, Knowledge, the Dhyâna of Boundary (the fourth
Dhyâna?), Emptiness (Çûnyatâ), Unconditionality (Animitta), Freedom from
Desire (Apra.nihita), miscellaneous Disciplines, various Meditations,
the Right Entering, Presentation (or perception), Knowledge of
Phenomena, Çamatha (tranquilisation), Vipaçyana (insight), the
Dharmasamgraha, and the Dharmaskandha.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   When the compilation of the Sûtra, the Vinaya, and the Abhidharma was
thus done, the heaven and the earth resounded with the praise of the
devas.

   *E. The Vinaya text of the Mahâsanghika school*.--Having reached at
last the state of Arhatship, Ânanda was permitted to join the assembly,
which unanimously acknowledged him as the disciple of best memory. They
requested him to compile the Dharmapitaka.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> When Ânanda began to recite, "Thus have
I heard: 'Buddha was at one time in the Bodhima.n.dara by the river
Nairañjanâ,'" the five hundred Bhikshus showed their deep feeling,
which, however, soon passed to the calm reflection that all things which
originate from a combination of causes are necessarily subject to ruin
and transformation.

   The Dharmapitaka thus compiled by Ânanda consisted of the Longer
Âgama; the Middling Âgama; the Miscellaneous Âgama,

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Observe that some of those subjects also appear in the Sûtrapitaka,
while the identity of others cannot be determined, owing to the brevity
of the statement.

2\. According to some the Dharmapitaka is identified with the
Sûtrapitaka, as in the present text; while, according to others, it is a
general name given to the entire collection of the sacred writings. This
disagreement among the records of different Buddhist schools apparently
shows that at the earlier stage of development of Buddhist literature
there was no definite name for the Pitaka compiled by the First
Convocation, which had probably been known by the simple designation,
Buddhavâcâ (Words of Buddha). Therefore we shall not run much risk in
considering those terms which are now currently used by Buddhists
themselves, as well as by Buddhist scholars, (to-wit, Vinayapitaka,
Sûtrapitaka, Abhidharma, Tripitaka or Dvipitaka), as the elaboration of
later Buddhists.\]

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span> which was so called because of its
dealing with miscellaneous subjects concerning predisposition (lit.
root, *mûla*), power (*bala*), enlightenment (*bodhi*), and the path
(*mârga*); and the Âgama Increasing by one, which was so called because
of a numerical arrangement of subjects from one up to one
hundred:<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> while the
Miscellaneous Pitaka comprised the Udâna (narratives), Itivrittika
(incidents), and Nidâna (circumstantial notes), relating to
Pratyekabuddhas and Arhats, which are written in verses
(Gâthâ).<sup><span class="small">\[2\]</span></sup>

   Upâli, who was announced by Buddha as well as by the Sa.ngha as the
first of the Vinaya-dharâ, was asked next to compile the Vinaya text. He
first told the Convocation that there were five sorts of purity, and
then proceeded to censure Ânanda for having committed the seven faults
as stated elsewhere, two of which, however, Ânanda refused to
acknowledge.<sup><span class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   Upâli is said to have then recited the nine divisions of the Vinaya,
to wit, (1) Pârâjika, (2) Samghâvaçesa, (3) two Aniyatas, (4) thirty
Naissargika, (5) ninety-two Prâyaçcittika, (6) four Pratideçanîya, (7)
Çikshâ, (8) seven Adhikara.naçamathas, and (9) rules conforming to the
Doctrine. He also explained in addition various meanings of the Vinaya:
for example, as to the distinction between the dreadful sins (pârâjika)
and serious offences (sthûlâtyaya), or as to a different classification
of the Vinaya-text. When thus they had finished compiling the Pitaka,
the ten hundred Bhikshus staying outside<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup> were called in and informed of the work
of the Convocation.

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The reader will observe that the number of the subjects contained
in the "Âgama increasing by one" differs in different texts.

2\. This statement is very valuable. The Mahâsa.nghika quarreled with
the Theravâda about the contents of the Khuddaka Nikâya, where these
books belong, and the very treatises which the Dîpavamsa says they
omitted, are wanting here.--Edmunds.

3\. It is noteworthy that according to the Mahâsamghika school the man
who blamed Ânanda before the assembly was not Mahâkâçyapa, but Upâli,
the first of the Vinaya-dharâ.

4\. What does the statement here refer to, which says one thousand
Bhikshus staying outside were summoned in? Hsüan-tsang mentions that the
Mahâsanghika school, being excluded from the assembly of the Sthavira
school, had their own compilation, meeting to the west of Mahâkâçyapa's
convocation. Does the present text refer to that?\]

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

   A vehement discussion now arose in the assembly as to what was meant
by Buddha when he said to Ânanda that the precepts of minor importance
could be dispensed with. A certain group of six Bhikshus went so far to
the extreme as to say that "if the World-Honored One were still living,
he would have everything at once abolished." Mahâkâçyapa, whose majestic
dignity and authority were equal to those of Buddha, then sternly
ordered them to keep silence, and made a declaration that all which had
ever been forbidden should be forbidden, and what had not been forbidden
should not be forbidden, and that they should not give any chance to the
heretics who were willing to blame the congregation at all costs.

   The text concludes with a list of the venerable masters through whom
this knowledge of the First Convocation was lineally transmitted down to
the venerable Tao-lih (Bodhibala?).<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   *F. The Sudarçana-vinaya*.--When the five hundred Bhikshus were
seated, Mahâkâçyapa asked them what they would first compile, the
Dharmapitaka or the Vinayapitaka, and to this they answered: "Venerable
Sir, the Vinayapitaka is the life of Buddhism, and so long as the
Vinayapitaka exists, Buddhism will also exist. Therefore, let us first
produce the Vinayapitaka."

   The next question was who should be the principal compiler of it:
Upâli suggested that Ânanda could be chosen for the position, but it was
not accepted by the assembly. Being recognised by Buddha as the first of
the Vinaya-dharâ, Upâli himself was prevailed upon to recite the Vinaya
by a general vote. After due formulary he produced all parts of the
Vinaya which consisted of the Prâtimoksha of Bhikshu and Bhikshuni, and
Skandhaka, and the Parivâra.

   Mahâkâçyapa then nominated Ânanda, according to a general wish of the
Sangha, to compile the Dharmapitaka. The Brâhmajâla and the
Çrâmaña-phala were first recited, and then all the five divisions of the
Sûtra, which consist of the Longer Agama Sûtra, the Middling Agama
Sûtra, the Samyukta Sûtra, the Anguttara

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. Why not give names, so as to compare with Theravâda list in
Mahâvamsa?--Edmunds.\]

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span> Sûtra, and the Khuddhaka Sûtra, the
last one containing all the words of Buddha (Buddha-vâcâ) not included
in the first four Âgamas.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   The speeches of Buddha, the text goes on to say, are of one taste,
have two functions, and are divisible into three periods: that is, they
all teach the means of deliverance (moksha) which consist in morality,
meditation, and understanding; they are composed of the Dharmapitaka and
the Vinayapitaka; they are divisible into the first speech, the last
speech, and those speeches which were delivered between them. The text
then raises the question: What is the Tripitaka? to which is given the
answer that it consists of Vinayapitaka, Sûtrapitaka, and
Abhidharmapitaka, together with their analytic explanation.<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> The contents of the Tripitaka given in
this way agree with those of the Pâli collection.<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   *G. Mahdprajñâpâramitâ Çâstra*.<sup><span
class="small">\[4\]</span></sup>--Mahâkâçyapa in a friendly way requests
Ânanda to compile the Dharmapitaka, saying: "Though there were many
great disciples of the Buddha to whom the guarding of Dharmapitaka was
entrusted, they are now all gone except you. Therefore, out of the
compassion for all beings and in accordance with the spirit of Buddha,
you shall compile the Buddhadharmapitaka." Thus requested, Ânanda
ascends the lion-seat, and reverentially turning towards the place where
Buddha's Nirvâna took place, says: "Though I did not personally hear the
first preaching of Buddha, I have learned it by hearsay. When Buddha was
in Vârâ.nasî, he first opened the gate of nectar for the five Bhikshus
and preached the Four Noble Truths of Suffering,

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The Pâli commentaries say the same.--A. J. E.

2\. This is very strange, because the text bas before said that the
First Convocation compiled the Vinaya and Sûtra only. I am inclined to
think that these additional statements, as well as the succeeding
detailed explanation of such terms as Sûtra, Abhidharma, Pitaka, and
Âgama, are later interpolations put down here by way of commentary, but
which in the course of time have been mixed up with the text.

3\. The Chinese characters for transliteration in the present text, so
far as they have come under my notice, strongly suggest that the text is
a translation of the Pâli original, though I have retained the Sanskrit
terms for the sake of uniformity.

4\. The present text belongs to the Mahâyâna literature, and it will be
very interesting to contrast its accounts of the First Convocation with
those of the preceding ones, which all belong to the Hînayâna
Buddhism.\]

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span> Amassing, Cessation, and the Path.
Ajñâta Kau.n.dinya was the first to perceive the Path, and 80,000 devas
also all entered upon the Path."

   When the one thousand Arhats assembled in the Convocation heard the
words of Buddha as recited by Ânanda, they were greatly afflicted with
the thought that they could no more hear Buddha's personal address. The
Sthaviras Anuruddha and Mahâkâçyapa expressed in verses their deep
feelings about the impermanence of things.

   Mahâkâçyapa told Ânanda that all the teachings of Buddha, from the
Dharma-cakra-pravartana Sûtra down to the Mahâparinirvâna Sûtra, should
be classified in four divisions, each being called an Âgama, viz.: the
Âgama Increasing by One, the Middling Âgama, the Longer Âgama, and the
Coincidence Âgama.<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> And to
them all was given a general name: Sûtradharmapitaka.

   Upâli, who was recognised by the Samgha to be the first of the
Vinaya-dharâ among the five hundred Arhats,<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> was then asked to recite the Vinaya
consisting of eighty divisions.<sup><span
class="small">\[3\]</span></sup>

   Lastly, Ânanda was again requested to recite the first Abhidharma
taught by Buddha, as he was acknowledged among the five hundred Arhats
to be most conversant with the exposition of the Sûtra. He addressed the
Sangha: "Thus have I heard: Buddha was at one time in Çrâvasti, when he
told the Bhikshus that those who neither removed nor exterminated the
five dreadful \[sins\], the five misdemeanors, and the five sorts of
malice, would suffer in consequence innumerable misfortunes in this
life, bodily as well as spiritual, and in the future would fall down
into the evil paths; that those, however, who were free from these five
dreadful \[sins\], five misdemeanors, and five sorts of malice, would
enjoy in consequence various blessings in this life, bodily as well as
spiritual, and in the future be born in a pleasant heavenly abode. What

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. A literal translation of Samyuktâgama.

2\. Here, as well as further on, five hundred Arhats are mentioned. Is
this the number of the Arhats assembled in the Convocation? If so, it is
in direct contradiction to the above statement that there were a
thousand.

3\. One edition reads eight thousand, which is probably a misprint.\]

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span> are those five dreadful \[sins\] which
are to be kept away? They are: (1) killing, (2) stealing, (3) unlawful
lust, (4) lying, and (5) drinking spirits."

   All such matters were comprised under the Abhidharmapitaka. Thus
ended the compilation of the three Dharmapitakas.

 

INCIDENT OF PURÂNA.

   Three<sup><span class="small">\[1\]</span></sup> out of the eleven
Chinese translations which contain accounts of the First Convocation
refer to the episode of Purâ.na, who was in the south<sup><span
class="small">\[2\]</span></sup> when Mahâkâçyapa and five hundred
Bhikshus were working on the compilation of the Pitaka. According to the
Caturvarga-vinaya, the event occurred in the following manner:

   Having heard that the Convocation was taking place in Râjagriha,
Sthavira Purâ.na hastened thither, accompanied by his party, which
consisted of five hundred Bhikshus. He went to Mahâkâçyapa and asked if
he also might be allowed to learn all that had happened. Mahâkâçyapa
thereupon again summoned the assembly, requested Upâli to rehearse what
he had recited, and had other things repeated as they had been done
before. Purâ.na expressed his satisfaction with the general proceedings
of the Convocation, except as to the insertion of the following eight
indulgences, which had been plainly approved by Buddha, and unmistakably
kept in memory by himself. The eight things were: (1) Keeping food
indoors; (2) Cooking indoors; (3) Cooking of one's own accord; (4)
Taking food of one's own accord; (5) Receiving food when rising early in
the morning; (6) Carrying food home according to the wish of a giver;
(7) Having miscellaneous fruits; (8) Eating things grown in (or by?) a
pond.

   These indulgences, said he, were not against the rule that forbids
the taking of the remnant of food. Mahâkâçyapa told him that he was
correct in saying so, but that Buddha permitted them only on account of
a scarcity of food, when the Bhikshus could not

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The Pañcavarga-vinaya, the Caturvarga-vinaya, and the
Vinaya-mâtrikâ.

2\. According to the Pañcavarga-vinaya, agreeing with the Pâli.\]

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span> get a sufficient supply of it by going
their rounds, and that therefore when this circumstance was removed,
Buddha again bade them to abstain from these eight indulgences. Purâ.na,
however, protested, declaring that Buddha, who was all-wise, would not
permit what otherwise was forbidden, nor would he forbid what otherwise
was permitted. To this Mahâkâçyapa replied: "The very reason of his
being all-wise has enabled him to permit what otherwise was forbidden,
and to forbid what otherwise was permitted. Purâ.na, we will now make
this decision: That whatever Buddha did not forbid shall not be
forbidden, and whatever Buddha forbade shall not be disregarded. Let us
train ourselves in accordance with the disciplinary rules established by
Buddha."

   The Pañcavarga-Vinaya mentions, instead of the eight above
enumerated, seven indulgences which, however, may be taken for eight,
according to how we punctuate the passage, though the text apparently
states "these seven things." They are slightly different from those in
the Caturvarga-vinaya, to-wit: (1) Keeping food indoors; (2) Cooking
indoors; (3) Cooking of one's own accord; (4) Receiving food in
compliance with the wish of another; (5) Taking fruit of one's own
accord; (6) Receiving things coming out of a pond; (7) Eating fruit with
its seeds (or stone) removed, when received from one who is not a
regular attendant in the Samgha.<sup><span
class="small">\[1\]</span></sup>

   According to the Vinaya-mâtrikâ Sûtra, the first of the eight
indulgences is the keeping of food indoors, and the last is the eating
of sundry grasses and roots (or roots of grass) growing by a pond, but
the six intermediate ones are not mentioned.

   Mahâkâçyapa is said to have told Purâ.na about the eight excellent
qualities of Buddha, by virtue of which he could, when deemed fit,
establish or abolish the rules for the benefit of the Samgha.

 

PLACE AND TIME.

   All the Chinese works, already referred to, agree in stating that the
First Convocation took place in Râjagriha, though they

<span class="small"></span>

\[1. The last passage is not clear, and we may consider it either as
forming an independent statement or as an appendix to the sixth.\]

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span> differ as to the special locality of
the city. The Saptapar.na Cave, the Pippala Rock, the Kshatrya Cave, and
the Gridhrakûta are the places thus mentioned in them.

   As to the time, they unanimously say that the event happened
immediately after the demise of Buddha, though they in no wise agree
regarding the exact date.
