### CHAPTER XII.

### LIMITLESS FIELDS OF INTEREST

### A "UNIVERSE" TO EXPLORE

There is not the slightest question in the thoughts of any intelligent
man or woman, but that "all people" want to see and enjoy as many of the
gloriously beautiful and awe-inspiring places of interest on this earth,
as their capacity for appreciation can hold. We should start enjoying
the world, and its limitless variety of blessings "now," and before our
interest in life starts running down, and the world says we have grown
old. Old age is more a condition of one's mentality—"a loss of interest
in life;"—a condition of boredom resulting from the endlessly monotonous
repetition of common-place duties and common-place interests,—much more
the outgrowth of such experiences than the direct result of the wearing
out of our bodies. Bodily decrepitude and lack of vitality and life
would not occur in the experience of the average individual for many
years later than they now seem to, were men and women each day making
discoveries of new interests, instead of being forced to spend literally
"all" of their waking hours in a daily round of monotonous
"soul-destroying routine duties." The International Institute of
Universal Research and Administration seeks

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

the privilege of "uniting" mankind for the purpose of providing such
interests.

**AFTER ALL, WHAT A "CRUEL FARCE" IT IS THAT ANY ONE SHOULD EVER GROW
BORED WITH LIFE IN A WORLD WHICH CONTAINS SUCH A VARIETY OF
INEXHAUSTIBLE INTERESTS AS OUR EARTH.** No individual could ever travel
to each point of beauty and grandeur which it provides, even if every
day of his life were devoted to doing nothing but traveling in search of
beauty;—nor could he really learn to know and understand and appreciate
all of our earth's varieties of beauty, even if he were able to spend
hundreds of years doing nothing else. This same statement might apply to
the study of the world's beautiful paintings, its poetry and
literature—the study of nature—of animals, and the incalculable variety
of expressions of life, from the "infinitesimal" to "The Infinite."
Growing acquainted with the habits, actions and interests of the
numerous forms of life which occupy this world with us, and with which
we can readily become friends, companions and protectors—could never
grow monotonous even if we were to spend thousands of years doing that
alone.

Those who are inclined towards exploration in the fields of science, are
aware of the fact that they have not penetrated even the "outer shell"
of Mind's limitless potentialities in that direction. Those who prefer
to raise their thoughts above the shaping and forming of objectified
expressions, such as machinery and the use of the world's various
elements and materials, and seek instead to look

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

out into limitless space, in the study of the and the numerous
fascinating discoveries of astronomy, have before them a field of
adventure which they could not exhaust during many thousands of years of
ceaseless investigation. Those who prefer to take the microscope instead
of the telescope in their explorations into the "limitless expressions"
of **Mind,**—(which our **Creator** has formed in such variety and
profusion, beyond the discernment of not only the naked eye, but of even
the most highly developed microscopes of today),—have not even started
on their journey of discovery in the field of the "infinitesimal
expressions" of our Creator's omniscience, and surely they need never
fear of wearing out their field of interest.

No, there is not the slightest possibility of a man growing bored with
life because of its monotonous sameness, except to the extent that he,
himself, closes his eyes and like a little Potato Bug, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4.md)—becoming satisfied with his own little
patch of potatoes,—gradually grows to think that since there is nothing
in life but potatoes, and he knows all about them, there is nothing
worth living for. Nor should men's mentalities become like another type
of Potato Bug which makes no effort towards further exploration of the
world and its interests, because of the fact that he quite accidentally
crawled out from behind his great big potato one day, and seeing just
above his head the bushy leaves of the upper part of his potato
plant,—(which no other potato bug had ever before discovered),—grew
quite certain—because of the vast area

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

of the potato plant—that there was nothing left to discover, and also
quite sure in his own mind that he should be forever honored by all
other Potato Bugs for having finally reached the most distant outpost of
the universe. Carrying our illustration a bit further, we find that
because of the fact that this little Potato Bug's discovery was greater
than that of any other Potato Bug before his time, all of the other
little bugs in the "Potato-bug" world, settled back to live a life of
common-place monotony, because they were quite sure there could be
nothing left to discover, and no honors for them; quite sure that there
was nothing new under the sun. **"Ah yes! Life is just one potato after
another;"—and so during that generation of potato bugs, there was no
further effort expended in the fields of research or exploration.**

However, when the excitement over the "startling" and "colossal" nature
of the "vast discovery" represented by the finding of the potato plant
had gradually worn away, a little Potato Bug, less satisfied with life
than his brothers, decided—after viewing the leaves of the potato plant
immediately in front of his gaze—that he would undertake further
explorations; so, instead of returning by the pathway leading down among
the potatoes, he crawled out three or four inches beyond the shadow of
the vast and terrifying potato plant, and looking up, he chanced to see
a cornstalk towering into the sky far beyond the limits of his naked
eye. So huge and tall was this cornstalk which he gazed upon, that for a
minute he actually felt a sense of humility, for he began to realize
that only a wisdom "much greater" than his own could possibly have

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

brought to pass such an awe-inspiring spectacle, or any creation of such
"colossal dimensions," as that of the cornstalk.

And so we find that these little bugs started to honor and glorify not
just the accomplishments of their **"Super Potato Bugs,"** but also the
creation of a power and intelligence which,—after much humbling of their
egos,—they finally acknowledged to be superior and greater than any
Potato Bug could ever hope to become. Thereafter, they no longer wasted
all of their lives paying homage to other Potato Bugs, but instead they
began an orderly and systematic investigation of the handiwork of a
Creator whom they knew must possess power and wisdom far surpassing
their own. It was not long before they had traveled beyond the cornstalk
and discovered a great big stack of hay. One day while they were
contemplating the findings of many generations of their most courageous
"Brother Bugs" who had finally completed measuring the length of one
side of this vast new spectacle, they looked around its edge and, to and
behold, they brought within the range of their highly developed
telescopes (?) the full stature of a man. **Farmer Jones, himself, had
become known to his Potato Bugs!**

Beholding something almost as vast as their colossal cornstalk, and yet
something able to walk and move around from one place to another, just
as they themselves could do, they finally concluded,—after going back to
their Potato-Bug Capitol and spending many long Potato-Bug years in
discussion and debate,—**that they had seen "the Creator of all the
world," and that they had beheld the being whom henceforth they would
worship as their God.**

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> **THAT ENDED THE
POTATO BUGS' FURTHER EFFORTS AT DISCOVERY, FOR THEY FELT QUITE CERTAIN
THAT THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO FIND. THEY HAD NEVER DEVELOPED
TELESCOPES CAPABLE OF SEEING EVEN TO THE TOP OF A TREE, NOR TO THE
LITTLE HOUSE IN WHICH FARMER JONES LIVED. HOWEVER, "THEY WERE
SATISFIED," AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT THEIR MENTALITIES ARE STILL JUST
THOSE OF "LITTLE POTATO BUGS."**

Mankind might well guard against the mental qualities of **"smug
self-satisfaction;"** for unless we are no farther advanced than "Potato
Bugs," we must surely realize that we have not yet even started to
discover the smallest part of the creations of limitless wisdom, nor to
recognize even an infinitesimal part of the power and might of life, nor
of that source from which the universe and all that is therein, **"truly
emanates."** Just as the little Potato Bugs had not yet discovered
Farmer Jones' home, nor even the boundary or fence line which encircled
the field containing their Potato-Bug kingdom,—neither has man, up to
this stage in history, explored even his own immediate surroundings, nor
the smallest part of the field—(our earth)—in which he lives.

Just as beyond Farmer Jones' field there exists the rest of his farm,
and beyond that his neighbor's farm, and then the boundaries of the
County and the State, and finally the Nation itself—a part of Farmer
Jones' continent

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

in turn bounded by oceans—and beyond them other continents, and so on; .
. . likewise there exists beyond the boundaries of our earth, fields of
"infinite" exploration, limitless elements, resources and awe-inspiring
soul-expanding scenes, which man will never learn to enjoy nor, in fact,
even see unless he grows—not just merely "discontented"—but **"wholly
unsatisfied"** with his present attainments, and determines to look far
beyond himself and his own handiwork, to those expressions of wisdom and
power, might and eternality, which make the works of men seem but
foolishness in the sight of God.

Well might men cultivate qualities of humility—cease their futile and
puny struggles among and against themselves—and combine what little
wisdom they at this time have learned to express, and what few energies
and powers they have learned to harness, and in the spirit of brotherly
love,—in limitless expectation of incalculable benefits and joys
awaiting their efforts,—become **"Mankind United."**

**"One for All and All for One,"**—Mankind United could enter upon an
adventure truly worthy of intelligent creatures;—the building of a world
free from petty and puny human differences;—free from wars, free from
racial, class or religious antagonisms, and the wholly needless poverty
which forces men into lives of drab, ugly monotony. **"Mankind United"**
will bring immediate rewards of financial independence to all people,
and an end to all wars; an end to those experiences which cause men to
feel that there is nothing of interest in life. **"Mankind United"**—can
put an end to that attitude of life which

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

suggests that, after all, life is just "one potato after another," with
nothing to look forward to and no hope of change.

**LET THE POTATO BUG STAY IN HIS PATCH OF POTATOES IF HE SO DESIRES, BUT
LET MEN TRAVEL AT LEAST TO THE BOUNDARY LINE AROUND THE FIELD WHICH THEY
CALL THEIR EARTH, AND LEARN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ITS RICH FURNISHINGS
AND PRICELESS TREASURES.**

How can men and women of wealth, or even those in very moderate
circumstances,—but with enough to eat and to wear and a home in which to
live, shut their eyes to mankind's suffering, and yet obtain any sense
of joy or happiness? How can we even "hope" to find contentment and
peace within our thoughts, when in the very midst of God's indescribably
glorious universe—all around us here on this earth which we call our
home—we find the ugliness of greed and the selfishly-cruel handiwork of
men expressed as oppression, and an endless personification of **"Man's
Inhumanity to Man,"** with its dirt and filth, its poverty, jealousy,
envy, hate, murder and war? The evidences of cruelty—instead of
brotherly love—ceaselessly force themselves upon our thoughts whenever
love, awakening in our hearts, opens the blindness of our eyes and the
deafness of our ears, so that we may see and hear the soul-searing
struggles and agonizing cries of men and women beseeching us to help
them untangle the hopeless poverty-stricken uselessness of their lives.
Multitudes of our fellow beings beseeching some one to show them,—

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (mind you, right
here in the very midst of God's inexhaustible provision of mankind's
needs), just "one thing" worth living for.

**THE REMAINDER OF THE EARTH'S INHABITANTS ARE IN A CONDITION ALMOST AS
PITIABLE,—"WAITING FOR SHIPS TO COME IN" WHICH SELDOM IF EVER ARRIVE.
ALWAYS DO MEN THINK THAT THEY WILL START LIVING "TOMORROW" OR THAT
SOON—"WHEN CONDITIONS CHANGE FOR THE BETTER"—ALL WILL BE WELL, AND "THEN
THEY CAN START LIVING." ALWAYS IT IS TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, OR NEXT YEAR;
"CENTURIES HAVE PASSED AND STILL MANKIND WAIT UNTIL SOME 'FUTURE TIME,'
TO START LIVING."**

Until we close our eyes and shut our ears to the suffering and cries of
anguish on all sides,—and become nothing more than animals selfishly
concerned only with our own welfare,—there can never be even any
imaginary joy in'ôur hearts. Until we destroy, not merely the "effects"
of disappointment, fear or hopelessness in the lives of men, but the
age-old antiquated and outgrown "causes" of these conditions;—until
every man, woman and child on the face of this earth has enough to eat,
enough clothes to wear, a place called home, and the time and
opportunity with which to seek and to learn the truths about this
glorious adventure called "life;"—until we have the leisure time and the
opportunity in which to learn to love this beautiful old world of ours,
and to find a variety of interests with which to break the "mesmeric"
spell of the monotonous

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

routine of common-place detail duties, there can never be lasting peace,
security or joy in the life of any man or woman.

Not even a "brief glimpse" of happiness and real peace—way down deep
within our hearts—is ever even momentarily possible, until we first shut
our eyes and our ears to the appeals of the hundreds of millions of
confused hopeless human beings who are ceaselessly crying out for some
one to help them. And yet, such people have just as much right to find
peace and happiness here on this earth—and just as much right to draw
upon our Creator's limitless resources—as the most "saintly" or the most
"successful" man or woman who ever walked upon this or any other planet
throughout the universe.

**IN THIS WORLD OF YOURS AND OURS, THERE ARE OVER ONE THOUSAND MILLION
(1,000,000,000) MEN AND WOMEN UNABLE TO READ OR WRITE AND CONSTANTLY
FILLED WITH NAMELESS SUPERSTITIOUS FEARS; AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION
(500,000,000) HUMAN BEINGS ALWAYS HUNGRY, HOMELESS, AND UNWANTED!! ARE
SUCH CONDITIONS ACTUALLY NECESSARY? MUST WE GO THROUGH LIFE EITHER AS
ONE OF A COUNTLESS MULTITUDE OF SUCH HOPELESS CREATURES, OR ONE OF THOSE
WHO MUST FOREVER LISTEN TO THEIR CRIES FOR HELP? IS THERE A SOLUTION TO
THESE PROBLEMS? IF THERE BE ANY MEANS BY WHICH TO SILENCE THEIR CRIES,
IT MUST BE IN A DIRECTION OTHER THAN THE ONES IN**

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

**WHICH WE HAVE SEARCHED THROUGHOUT THE PAST CENTURIES!! IF AN ECONOMIC
SYSTEM CAN BE BUILT WHICH WILL BE CAPABLE OF GUARANTEEING FINANCIAL
SECURITY AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR HAPPINESS FOR "ALL" PEOPLE, IT MUST BE
ONE "VASTLY DIFFERENT" THAN ANY THE HUMAN RACE HERETOFORE HAS ATTEMPTED
TO EVOLVE. THE AUTOCRATIC CAPITALISTIC RULE OF "THE SURVIVAL OF THE
FITTEST;" THE COMMUNISTIC SYSTEMS OF "MASS REGIMENTATION;" THE SYSTEM
WHICH MAKES MEN TEAR AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS LIKE PACKS OF WOLVES—WHICH
WE CALL "OUR PRIVATE PROFIT" OR "COMPETITIVE SYSTEM"—HAVE ALL FAILED.**

constitute a Potato Bug's sole environment and primary interest in life.
