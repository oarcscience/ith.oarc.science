### CHAPTER XX.

### A CALL TO ARMS!

### AND

### A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INSTITUTE'S

### PROGRAM

### WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP

**All that has been said in this "explanatory" bulletin regarding the
program of The International Institute of Universal Research and
Administration, would be of no avail were it not "acted upon."**

**Unless those who have read our proclamation decide to "personally
co-operate" in the promulgation of this message, they might just as well
have not read it at all. Words "without actions" are like rooms without
lights—they may be "veritable treasure houses"—and yet if no hand were
reached out to make use of the treasures—(by turning on the lights and
discovering their true value)—in other words, by acting upon the
knowledge of the "availability" of such treasures as our words have
described,—there would be no reason for having written them.**

Were it not that the "actions" we recommend for the formation of an
organization large enough to accomplish the result we have herein
described, would require but little more energy than that which you
might use in reaching out your hand and pressing an electric light
button in

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

some "treasure room" into which you had been led, there might be some
slight justification for hesitancy or procrastination. However, the only
steps you are asked to take, consist in placing four (4) or more copies
of this "Explanatory" bulletin in circulation by lending them to your
many friends and acquaintances.

Only such action on the part of many millions of men and women—"and
without delay"—can possibly bring about the formation of a group of
people sufficiently large to combat the ceaselessly growing menace—not
only of Communism—but also that of another great world war; a war, the
successful consummation of which will bring about the establishment of a
type of human slavery so terrifying that words cannot even start to
describe it.

The responsibility of preventing the fulfillment of the plans of our
world's incalculably wealthy Hidden Rulers, belongs as much to one as to
another, and yet—(if the world's "right-thinking" inhabitants are
willing to act as a body and do as did the Children of Israel—in their
march around the walls of Jericho—and they will—with **"one
voice"**—demand that these subversive forces be forever uprooted, and
that an economic system be founded upon the "Literal Signification" as
well as the "Spiritual Principle" of Christ Jesus’ Golden Rule)—such a
result can be quickly brought to pass,—and with but little individual
effort.

**If you value the safety and happiness of your loved ones—as well as
your own security—you will not only "act" upon the recommendations
contained on the last**

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

**page of this book, but you will do it "Today," while this subject is
fresh in your thought, and before numerous responsibilities or demands
upon your time cause you to postpone such "needed" action.**

**WE STILL HAVE THE PRIVILEGES OF "FREE SPEECH" AND "THE RIGHTS OF
ASSEMBLY" IN BUT A FEW OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NATIONS. HOW LONG IT WILL BE
BEFORE THE RIGHT TO SAY WHAT WE THINK, AND THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING WITH
OUR FELLOW BEINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF RIGHTING ANY WRONGS UNDER WHICH WE
MAY BE SUFFERING, WILL STILL BE GRANTED TO US—IN VIEW OF THE GROWTH OF
COMMUNISM AND DICTATORSHIPS—NO ONE KNOWS. BUT "TODAY" IS YOURS!—AND AT
"THIS MINUTE"—"NOW!"—WHILE YOU ARE READING THIS BOOK, YOU STILL HAVE
THOSE PRIVILEGES. DO NOT DEPRECIATE THEIR IMPORTANCE, NOR BE DECEIVED
INTO THINKING THAT THEY WILL ENDURE IN SPITE OF THE UNDERMINING
INFLUENCE OF THE "ATHEISTIC TERMITES" OF COMMUNISM AND
FASCISM—SELFISHNESS—GREED—BRUTALITY—AND THE MAD AMBITION OF THE
FABULOUSLY WEALTHY "MORAL IDIOTS" WHO NOW CONTROL THE WORLD'S MAJOR
FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL STRUCTURES! DO NOT BE DECEIVED INTO BELIEVING
THAT SUCH RIGHTS WILL EXIST WITHOUT "YOUR HELP" AND THE WEIGHT OF "YOUR
INFLUENCE," (EVEN THOUGH IT MAY SEEM TO BE EVER SO SLIGHT IN YOUR OWN
EYES.) FOR**

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> **SUCH IS NOT THE
CASE! ALREADY THESE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN LARGELY LOST!!!**

**THERE ARE BUT FEW PILLARS UPHOLDING THE LIBERTIES OF FREE MEN, THAT
HAVE NOT ALREADY BEEN GNAWED THROUGH—OR ROTTED OUT AT THEIR VERY
CORES—BY THE POISONOUS ATHEISTIC TEACHINGS OF THE WORLD'S TENS OF
MILLIONS OF COMMUNISTS AND FASCISTS;—ATHEISTS WHO TEACH "THE BROTHERHOOD
OF MAN" WHEN THEY SEEK NEW RECRUITS FOR THEIR RANKS, YET WHOSE LEADERS
LIVE THE LIVES OF "RAVENOUS WOLVES," AND PRACTICE THE BRUTALITIES OF THE
DARK AGES, AS SOON AS THEY HAVE PLACED THEIR VICTIMS COMPLETELY UNDER
THEIR DESPOTIC CONTROL.**

**Only "your help"—combined with millions of other clear-thinking men
and women—can prevent civilization's final overthrow by these forces!!!
Only the establishment of an economic system based upon the irrevocable
principle of "Universal Economic Equality,"—as preached—not by the
Communists and Fascists—but by "Christ Jesus"—(when He promised us that
the Kingdom of Heaven was "at hand," and its limitless joys available
for our happiness whenever we would practice His Golden Rule, and
"equally share" the world's bounty with our fellowmen)—can ever destroy
the "humanly planned" and "humanly perpetuated" causes of world-wide
illiteracy, poverty, and war.**

It is imperative that you raise your voice—"now"—in behalf of the
establishment of such an economic system,

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

while you are still allowed to speak your thoughts and to meet with your
brother-man for discussions regarding them. Your help is greatly needed
if we are to maintain—and perpetually retain—such rights. You possess
these rights today, but no one on this earth can promise that you will
still be granted them tomorrow. We therefore feel fully justified in
appealing to you for your co-operation, and in warning you against
procrastinating. **We not only invite you to act upon the
recommendations contained herein, but it would not be possible for us to
"too strongly" impress upon your thought, the urgency of acting
"today!"**

 <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md)**"There is a principle, which is a
bar against all information, which is proof against all argument, and
which cannot fail to keep man in everlasting ignorance."—AGAIN WE REMIND
YOU THAT THIS PRINCIPLE IS—"CONTEMPT PRIOR TO EXAMINATION."**

**INASMUCH AS OUR WORLD-WIDE PROGRAM WILL BE FREE TO THOSE WHO HAVE
PURCHASED AND CAREFULLY STUDIED A COPY OF THIS BOOK, OUR SPONSORS
REQUEST THAT YOU POSTPONE ANY ATTEMPT TO JUDGE THE MANY ASPECTS RELATIVE
TO THE PRACTICAL OPERATION OF SAID PROGRAM, OR THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE
CORPORATION, UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF OUR RESEARCH DEPARTMENT'S 30-DAY
RELEASE OF ITS DISCOVERIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS REQUEST IS
JUSTIFIED—(AS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY STATED HEREIN)—BY THE FACT THAT NOT
EVEN THE**

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> **WORLD'S MOST
BRILLIANT ECONOMISTS COULD AT THIS STAGE IN OUR PROGRAM, WITH ANY DEGREE
OF FAIRNESS EITHER TO THEMSELVES OR TO US, PASS JUDGMENT THEREON.**

**ALL WE ARE ASKING YOU TO DO AT THIS TIME, IS TO HELP US FORM AN
AUDIENCE LARGE ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE RELEASE OF OUR RESEARCH
DEPARTMENT'S PAST SIXTY YEARS OF DISCOVERIES, AND A FULL AND COMPLETE
DESCRIPTION OF ITS RECOMMENDATIONS; BUT WE DO ASK THAT YOU HELP US TO
FORM THIS AUDIENCE AND THAT YOU GRANT US YOUR CO-OPERATION IN ITS
FORMATION, "WITHOUT DELAY!"**

**I—If you believe that the world has enough efficient executives,
highly trained workers and mechanical inventions, and that it has
sufficient undeveloped resources with which to end both poverty and
war;—if—(knowing that the world has over one hundred (100) times more
agricultural land than has ever been intensively cultivated)—you are
willing to permit such undeveloped lands to be made use of to produce
the food with which to feed "the entire human race;"**

**II—If you do not object to voting in favor of granting five hundred
million (500,000,000) of the present "unemployed" inhabitants of our
earth the right to keep from "starving to death," and if you do not
object to allowing them to exchange their labor for food, by creating
and maintaining tens of thousands of miles of broad tree-lined
highways—constructing greatly**

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

**needed flood control facilities—canals and harbors—building air
ports—draining the swamps and taking water into the deserts—designing
and developing thousands of gloriously beautiful parks—playgrounds and
athletic fields,—and to thereby turn our world into the garden spot it
was intended to be;**

**III—If you are willing to permit the world's hundreds of millions of
intelligent, talented, and highly capable unemployed men and women to
regain their morale, and to earn their financial independence by turning
our earth into a literal paradise of beauty and security for the entire
human race;**

**IV—If you do not object to having the talents and efforts of such
people directed not only for the accomplishment of the above described
results, but also combined with the rest of the world's trained workers
to provide a beautiful, substantial, and well-furnished home—(set in
beautifully landscaped grounds)—for every family on our earth—"within
less than ten years"—irrespective of race, religion, class, color or
vocation,—and subject only to the willingness of the Corporation's
"co-owner" employees to learn how to use—enjoy—and protect such
possessions as are made available to them;**

**V—If you are willing that mankind should receive—through the avenues
of more efficient methods of production and distribution—an immediate
saving of approximately twenty-five (25c) cents out of the average
dollar now spent for merchandise, and that all men**

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

**and women in every nation should be granted the le lowing described
benefits:—**

1st.—Guaranteed immediate employment and an international labor schedule
of 4 hours per day, 4 days a week, 8 months each year;

2nd.—An assured vacation period (with pay) for all workers, of 3 days
per week, and 4 entire months each year;

3rd.—A minimum of $3,000.00 per year ($250.00 per month)—salary or
income, for all adults—"both men and women"—irrespective of race, creed,
color, class, profession or vocation;

4th.—A pension of not less than $3,000.00 per year for all men and women
over 40 years of age, (who desire to have their full time for their own
use,)—provided they have worked a total of not less than eleven thousand
(11,000) hours for the internationally owned world-wide
corporation,—(approximately 20 years of work at 4 hours per day, 4 days
per week, 8 months each year, or 10 years of work at 8 hours per day, 4
days per week, 8 months each year);

5th.—A pension of $3,000.00 per year—(without any restrictions as to
length

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

of employment)—for all incapacitated men or women, and for all persons
over 60 years of age, who desire to have their full time for their own
use;

**VI—If you are willing to have a great universal service corporation
immediately established, which will be "equally owned" and "equally
controlled" by those who approve of its formation, and which will be
capable of bringing to pass the above described results without
bloodshed or resort to "brute force" of any kind, and without
"confiscating"—"destroying"—or "acquiring"—anyone's properties or
assets,—until just compensation has first been allowed,"—but which will
be powerful, influential, and wealthy enough to "fully reimburse," not
only those whom it will employ, but also the individuals, groups or
companies, whose properties or assets may be required for the successful
accomplishment of the results and benefits to which we have herein
referred;—a corporation capable of producing enough food, clothes,
homes, and educational, cultural and travel facilities, to abundantly
meet the demands of every man, woman and child on our planet, and able
to make all useful, interesting or beautiful parts of the earth,
accessible by adequate highways, harbors and air ports;—a corporation
with the facilities for permanently hiring and directing a force of one
hundred million (100,000,000) men and women gardeners and landscape
architects, exclusively for the purpose of developing and permanently
maintaining thousands of parks, gardens, playgrounds, and athletic
fields in all nations;—a corporation wit**h

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

**the educational facilities for teaching a universal auxiliary
language, and thereby rapidly overcoming the religious, racial, and
class antagonisms which now result in such widespread and destructive
hatred;**

**VII—If you are willing—through the concerted action of the world's
educated and religious peoples—to bring about the disbandment of all
armies and navies, and the destruction of all munitions and armaments of
war in all nations, and to do so "simultaneously" with the establishment
of an International Home Guard capable of maintaining peace and order
throughout the world;—and if you are willing that there should be no
more revolutions, "wars" or "rumors of wars;" no more illiteracy or
"maliciously perpetuated" forms of superstition; no more "hungry" or
"starving" men, women, or little children, and no more ugliness or
poverty in any part of our gloriously beautiful world home;**

**VIII—If you are willing to have our Research Department's discoveries
presented to you during a great world-wide free 30-day
program;—(evidence which will—for all time to come—prove that each and
every one of the benefits described in this volume, can be brought to
pass at any time that two hundred million (200,000,000) "intelligently
industrious" and "right-thinking" men and women agree to combine their
talents and their strength towards such an accomplishment;)**

**IX—If—after receiving the above-mentioned program—you would be willing
to cast your vote either "for" or "against" each of the one hundred
(100) recommendations**

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

**which will at that time be submitted to you,—(bearing always in mind
that you will then be voting with a "full and complete knowledge" of all
facts,—"not blindly"); and—(in final conclusion of this resumé of our
program)—if you are willing to take into consideration the fact that
every minute of hunger and exposure, now being "needlessly experienced"
by hundreds of millions of "starving"—"homeless" human beings, seems
like "an eternity of torture" to them, and if you are willing to also
take into consideration the further and even more greatly important
fact—to you and your loved ones—that every hour of delay lessens
mankind's ability to safeguard their lives and their liberties against
the impending war of planned wholesale extermination;—then we invite you
to help us to help you—your loved ones—your friends and your neighbors,
to help the right - thinking men and women of this earth to
"immediately" meet together in a common cause on the common ground of a
common-sense world-wide program of "right ideas," and a final
"conclusive attack" upon the "real causes" of mankind's poverty,
bloodshed and suffering.**

**MEANWHILE, LET US SHORTEN THE PERIOD OF HUMANITY'S "UTTERLY NEEDLESS
AGONY," AS MUCH AND AS "RAPIDLY" AS POSSIBLE BY "AT ONCE" GOING INTO
ACTION TO SPEED THIS PRACTICAL MESSAGE—OF "PEACE ON EARTH AND GOOD WILL
TO ALL MANKIND"—QUICKLY UPON ITS WAY!!!**

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

**IN HELPING TO BUILD OUR GREATLY NEEDED NEW ECONOMIC SYSTEM YOU WILL BE
STARTING WITH US UPON THE MOST GLORIOUS ADVENTURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY
THE MEN OR WOMEN OF ANY AGE; AN ADVENTURE TRULY WORTHY OF INTELLIGENT
CREATURES,—FOR YOUR REWARD WILL BE A WORLD OF "BROTHERLY LOVE" AND
"UNIVERSAL HAPPINESS";—A WORLD IN WHICH THERE WILL BE NEITHER "WAR" NOR
"POVERTY." BEFORE MANY MONTHS HAVE PASSED ALONG THEIR WAY, THOSE WHO ARE
NOW THE WORLD'S SUFFERING, HOPELESS, HELPLESS MILLIONS, WILL ENRICH YOUR
LIFE WITH THEIR MANY EXPRESSIONS OF GRATEFUL APPRECIATION FOR THE
BLESSINGS OF SECURITY AND HAPPINESS WHICH YOUR GENEROUS ASSISTANCE WILL
HAVE HELPED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM.**
