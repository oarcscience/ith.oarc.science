### CHAPTER VI.

### 40,000 PRINCIPALITIES

### ONE THOUSAND MILLION SLAVES

### AND

### DEATH FOR ALL OF THE WORLD'S EDUCATED AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLES. SUCH ARE THE RESULTS WHICH WILL CONSTITUTE THE SUCCESSFUL CULMINATION OF THE CENTURY-OLD PLANS OF MANKIND'S HIDDEN RULERS.

During the 30-day program of The Research Department of The
International Institute of Universal Research and Administration,
photostatic copies of plans will be presented to the two hundred million
(200,000,000) men and women who will constitute our audience, which will
prove to even the most skeptical of them the necessity of establishing a
world-wide economic system based upon some medium of exchange and
currency other than gold and silver. The Institute's program will prove
to them, that unless the economic system it recommends is universally
established at an early date,—(as it can be at any time within ninety
(90) days upon the consent of the people to whom it will be
presented),—that within less than six (6) months after the conclusion of
the next world war there will be,—(with the exception of the Hidden
Rulers and their followers),—no educated people, (and in no part of the
world any religious ones); nor will there be any educational or
religious institutions nor facilities for the development of
independence of thought, in any nation on this earth, except among the
people who will then constitute its ruling class. <span

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

The Institute will prove that at the conclusion of the coming war, those
who have plotted it have planned to evolve an economic system which will
consist of four (4) levels of human society. **To bring this system to
pass, the entire world is being armed to the teeth, and even little ten
(10) year old children are being trained for its armies.**

The lowest of these four (4) levels will be made up of men and women who
will be trained to perform only such drudgery tasks as may require but
little intelligence. The next group above them will consist of the men
and women who have been taught to operate machines. The third class will
include, (up to eighty (80%) per cent of its numbers), the police force,
which will consist of eunuchs who will have the responsibility of
compelling obedience to the edicts of the rulers. This third class will
also include, (up to twenty (20%) per cent of its numbers), the
so-called intelligentsia, consisting of men who will be educated and
trained to conduct laboratories and research bureaus through which to
develop the requirements and luxuries for their Ruler and themselves.
The fourth class will be those for whom the first two groups exist as
slaves, and for whom eighty (80%) per cent of the third group act as
body-guards and twenty (20%) per cent as students and companions. Each
ruling family comprising this fourth group, (of which there will be but
forty thousand (40,000) will be allowed twenty thousand (20,000) slaves
and a bodyguard and group of student companions of five thousand (5000)
men to enforce their orders and provide both entertainment and
companionship, when desired.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

In other words, a total of twenty-five thousand (25,000) people will be
under the jurisdiction and control of each one of these forty thousand
(40,000) families; in all, a total of one thousand million
(1000,000,000) people. Each unit of twenty-five thousand (25,000) people
will consist of five thousand (5000) men in the third group and ten
thousand (10,000) men and women in the second group, which will include
mechanics and various types of machinists, each trained to do some
specific task but prohibited from learning any subject other than that
in which specific training has been ordered. In other words, each of
this second group will literally be a "human automaton." With ten
thousand (10,000) men and women laborers in the first group who will
perform all necessary drudgery tasks not taken care of by the machines,
these four groups with a total of twenty-five thousand (25,000) people,
and the family which rules them, will,—with whatever section of the
globe is allocated to them,—constitute a self-contained principality
over which the appointed ruler will have complete and absolute
autocratic control, with the power of life or death over his subjects.

No marriages will be allowed among the members of the twenty-five
thousand (25,000) men and women of any of these four groups. However,
after the respective ruler has made his selection of the most attractive
young girls of the first two groups for his own harem, then the one
thousand (1000) students of the third group will have the privilege of
drawing by lot, (but with no other rights of selection), whatever girls
they may desire as their concubines. All male children will be
emasculated, with the exception of the healthiest and best specimens.
These will

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

be selected and trained to replace the educated members of the third
group, as said members are retired from active service, or die.

Nurses will be selected from the first two groups, who will be put in
charge of all children who have passed the age of six months. During the
first six months, the respective mothers will be held responsible, under
the supervision of said trained nurses, for the health and care of their
babies. The only education which will be granted to the children who are
placed in the first two groups,—(or the police force branch of the third
group),—to replace those who die, will be limited to the training
required for the respective duties they will be expected to perform, in
accordance with the degree of their intelligence and potential
capabilities as determined by the sociologists and psychologists in the
laboratories directed by such scientists of the third group in charge of
these activities.

Neither reading nor writing will be taught to any of the persons
comprising the first two groups of twenty thousand (20,000) men and
women, nor to any of the men within the third group, other than one
fifth (1/5th) of their number; in other words, one thousand (1000) of
them will be educated and trained to carry on the work of the
laboratories and experimental and testing departments together with the
various bureaus established in accordance with the requirements,
interests, or hobbies of the ruler.

In order that the twenty-five thousand (25,000) slaves and selected
associates of each principality, may be readily kept under the immediate
observation and control of the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

respective ruler, these people will all be housed within one gigantic
structure of twenty-five stories in height, and with the palace and
gardens of its owner constructed on the top thereof. Directly beneath
the ruler's palace, occupying from the twenty-fifth (25th) down to and
including the tenth (10th) story of each such structure, there will be
constructed the numerous laboratories, testing, experimental and
research bureaus; television and radio departments; power-control rooms,
and educational center, as well as the amusement auditoriums for those
comprising the third group. From the ninth (9th) story down to and
including the first floor, will be located the machine shops and work
rooms of the twenty thousand (20,000) slaves of the first two groups,
who will be supervised by the five thousand (5000) members of the third
group, in the preparation and production of food, clothes, machinery,
amusement paraphernalia, and the general luxuries ordered by the ruler
for his use and that of the various members of the third group whom he
may, from time to time, favor with some expression of his appreciation
for their loyalty and services.

The living quarters for the twenty thousand (20,000) slaves comprising
the first two groups, will be located for a distance the equivalent of
ten stories directly beneath this gigantic structure. They will be so
placed, in order that the ruler might—by merely pressing a
button,—release any one of a number of kinds of poisonous gases, and
thereby not only succeed in quelling any general uprising, but also
readily eliminate any of the group who might become particularly unruly.
Such ones could be readily slaughtered by housing them in any one of a
number of different sections

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

of the subterranean area of his palace. In this section there will also
be located the power plants, water reservoirs and storage rooms,
hermetically sealed off from access by any other than the ruler's most
trusted slaves.

The living quarters above referred to will contain only the barest
requirements for sustaining human life. With the exception of the most
attractive girls who may be chosen by the ruler and the one thousand
educated members of the third group for their respective harems, the
remainder of the men and women slaves in these first two groups will
have their mentalities regularly dulled through the use of drugs and
dope placed in their food and drinking water, in order that the quality
of their thinking may remain on a similar level with that of the dullest
and least intelligent creatures of the animal kingdom, and that they may
therefore be readily satisfied with the coarsest kinds of food,—little
or no amusement,—and a stall with some straw upon which to lie, as the
only home they will ever know, or even have enough imagination to
desire.

The twenty-five thousand (25,000) slaves and guards, belonging to each
of those who will comprise the world's ruling class of forty thousand
(40,000) men, will be constantly under the direct observation of their
respective ruler, through the use of remotely-controlled television and
radio equipment, microphones, television screens, etc., placed in every
room and corner of the great structures which will constitute the palace
as well as factories and slave quarters belonging to each ruler. At any
time of the day or night, by either pressing a button or turning a dial,
the ruler will be able to look at or listen to any one

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

of his entire allotment of twenty-five thousand (25,000) slaves.

With the exception of his most trusted body-guards and himself, none of
his slaves will be allowed to understand the use of guns or other
armaments or facilities with which he will keep himself protected. In
order that not even one of the forty thousand (40,000) rulers or their
descendants may ever be tempted to increase the number of his slaves, or
to gain control of any other principality or part of the earth or its
resources, than that which has—by majority vote—been allotted to him, it
has been mutually agreed upon by those who constitute the present "Money
Changers" and "Hidden Rulers" of our day, that if any one of their
number should ever yield to such a temptation, such a one and his entire
unit of slaves will be blasted off the face of the earth by the
immediate simultaneous attack of the thirty-nine thousand nine hundred
and ninety nine (39,999) other rulers, with a combined armed force
consisting of whatever proportion of their one hundred and sixty million
(160,000,000) body-guards they may require for the accomplishment of
such a result.

It is therefore reasonable to state, that once the world's "Hidden
Rulers" have succeeded in slaughtering the present educated and
religious peoples of our earth, and have thereby gained not only
indirect but absolute and complete "Direct Control" of the world's
resources, machinery and remaining illiterate populations, they will
have little difficulty in maintaining their rule over mankind as long as
they may wish to do so, inasmuch as there would never thereafter be any
opportunity for the human race to combine

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

its forces against the rule of such depraved, insane monsters. Nor would
there ever be any likelihood of even the overthrow of such a type of
rule through the jealousy, envy or dissatisfaction of any of the various
"little" kings, inasmuch as the strength of their respective kingdoms
and their individual allotment of slaves, would never be sufficient to
tempt them into even contemplating an attack upon the approximately one
thousand million other human beings owned body and soul by the remaining
rulers, and constantly under their direct orders.

**Being aware of the fact that the smug complacency of some of the
modern educated intellects of this age will feel constrained to reject
the foregoing statements as being utterly fantastic and quite impossible
of accomplishment, we beg to be permitted to call attention to the
present "caste system" of India. With its numerous principalities, this
system has—century after century—functioned quite satisfactorily for the
fabulously wealthy Maharajahs of that country. Those who are inclined to
doubt, might also bear in mind the fact that the economic and governing
system of India is the only one that has produced "Multi-billionaires"
and maintained them in power generation after generation; nor have any
of the "modern trimmings" of recent scientific discoveries been required
to perpetuate or to aid its operation.**

**YES, INDEED, THE NEW ECONOMIC SYSTEM, NOW ABOUT TO BE ESTABLISHED BY
THE WORLD'S MONEY CHANGERS, WILL WORK "VICIOUSLY WELL" FOR ITS FEW
MASTERS.**

**The Research Department of The International Institute of Universal
Research and Administration is fully prepared—"with irrefutable
evidence"—to prove (during its 30-day program) that the plot—which has
been but briefly described in the foregoing chapter—will unquestionably
be consummated unless a new monetary and economic system is
"universally" established.**
