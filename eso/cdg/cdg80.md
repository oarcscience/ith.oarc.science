### TRUTH.

### MUHAMMED'S PROPHECY OF TRUTH.

### "TO ITS OWN BOOK SHALL EVERY NATION BE SUMMONED."

1\. "Men have rent their great concern, one among another, into seéts;
every party rejoicing in that which is their own;

Wherefore leave them till a certain time, in their depths of error.

2\. One day God will call to them and say, 'Where are my companions as
ye supposed them?'

*And we will bring up a witness out of every nation* and say, 'Bring
your proofs.' And they shall know that the truth is with God alone, and
the gods of their own devising shall desert them.

3\. And thou shalt see every nation KNEELING *to its own book shall
every nation be summoned*:"
