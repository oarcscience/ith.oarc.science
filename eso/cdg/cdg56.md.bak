### SERVIUS TULLIUS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_SS">SS</span></span>"The birth of
Servius Tullius was as marvellous as it was humble. Ocrisia, a handmaid
of the queen, and one of the captives taken at Corniculum, when bringing
some cakes as an offering to the household genius, saw an apparition of
the god in the fire on the hearth: Tanaquil commanded her to array
herself as a bride and shut herself up in the chapel. She became
pregnant by a god: many Romans called the household genius the father of
Servius, others Vulcan (God Of Fire)." <span class="small">HISTORY OF

"At that time, a prodigy occurred in the palace, wonderful both in its
appearance and in its result. They relate, that the head of a boy,
called Servius Tullius, as he lay fast asleep, blazed with fire in the
sight of many persons. That by the very great noise made at so
miraculous a phenomenon, the royal family

were awakened; and when one of the servants was bringing water to
extinguish the flame, that he was kept back by the queen, and after the
confusion was over, that she forbade the boy to be disturbed till he
should awake of his own accord. As soon as he awoke the flame
disappeared. Then Tanaquil, taking her husband into a private place,
said, 'Do you observe this boy whom we bring up in so mean a style? Be
assured that hereafter he will be a light to us in our adversity, and a
proteIor to our palace in distress. From henceforth let us, with all our
care, train up this youth, who is capable of becoming a great ornament
publicly and privately.' From this time the boy began to be treated as
their own son, and instruCted in those arts by which men's minds are
qualified to maintain high rank. The matter was easily accomplished,
because it was agreeable to the gods." <span class="small">TITUS LIVY,
