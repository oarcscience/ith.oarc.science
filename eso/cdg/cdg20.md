### THE EGG AND SERPENT SYMBOL.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_J">J</span></span>"The serpent,
separate or in combination with the j circle, egg, or globe, has been a
predominant symbol among many primitive nations. It prevailed in Egypt,
Greece, and Assyria, and entered widely into the superstitions of the
Celts, the Hindoos, and the Chinese. It even penetrated into America;
and was conspicuous in the mythology of the ancient Mexicans, among whom
its significance does not seem to have differed materially from that
which it possessed in the old world. The fad that the ancient Celts, and
perhaps other nations of the old continent, erected sacred structures

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

in the form of the serpent, is one of high interest. Of this description
was the great temple of Abury, in England,--in many respects the most
imposing ancient monument of the British islands." <span
id="fr_173"></span>[\*](#fn_173)

A celebrated example of the egg and serpent symbol is found in Adams
County, Ohio, United States of America. It is an enduring witness to the
fad that knowledge of the God-Mystery existed in North America at an
early period. "It is situated on a high spur of land, which rises a
hundred and fifty feet above Brush Creek. 'Conforming to the curve of
the hill, and occupying its very summit, is the serpent, its head
resting near the point, and its body winding back for seven hundred
feet, in graceful undulations, terminating in a triple coil at the tail.
The entire length, if extended, would be not less than one thousand
feet. The work is clearly and boldly defined, the embankment being
upwards of five feet in height, by thirty feet base at the centre of the
body, but diminishing somewhat toward the head and tail. The neck of the
serpent is stretched out, and slightly curved, and its mouth is opened
wide, as if in the ad of swallowing or ejeting an oval figure, which
rests partially within the distended jaws. This oval is formed by an
embankment of earth, without any perceptible opening, four feet in
height, and is perfectly regular in outline, its transverse and
conjugate diameters being one hundred

and sixty, and eighty feet respectively.' When, why, or by whom these
remarkable works were erected, as yet we know not. The present Indians,
though they look upon them with reverence, can throw no light upon their
origin."
