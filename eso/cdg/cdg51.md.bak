### NYMPH OF STAUFFENBERG.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_NN">NN</span></span>Now we will add
a true story concerning a Nymph of Stauffenberg. She was of marked
beauty and took her seat by the roadside waiting for the master whom she
had chosen for herself. These things, it is true, are thought by some
theologians to be mere mockeries and trickeries of the Devil--not
however by true theologians. What can be more important in the
Scriptures than to negleft nothing, to weigh everything honestly and
faithfully, to digest with a sober and attentive judgement, to
scrutinize everything every where with accuracy, and to despise nothing
unknown. Whence it is clear that these persons lightly and supinely pass
over these things, being ignorant of the truth, and pleading detersions
of the Devil though the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Devil himself is
not known to them. It should be reflected that such marvels are
permitted by God to the end that we may not all of us marry and live
with Nymphs, but only one here and one there, so that the wonderful
works of God among his creatures may be revealed and a surer knowledge
of them spread abroad. Had these been the works of the Devil, doubtless
they had deserved contempt. But they are not. The Devil cannot do such
things, but only God. But let us return to our story. This Nymph had
been a Water Nymph, and had married this citizen of Stauffenberg already
mentioned. . . . Many other events of like nature have occurred, but by
an evil example are passed over with contempt. From which the signal
folly of men is abundantly clear. <span class="small">PARACELSI LIBER DE
