### BOOK OF THE WARS OF THE LORD.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_II">II</span></span>"Wherefore it is
said in the book of the Wars of the Lord, What he did in the Red Sea,
and in the brooks of Arnon." <span class="small">NUMBERS xxi, 14</span>.

This is the only known reference to this work extant. From its title,
Hebrew scholars conclude that the Book of the Wars of the Lord contained
songs celebrating the victories of the Israelites under the leadership
of J HWH. Modern critics regard Numbers xxi, verses 17-18, 27, and
following, as extracts from this book.
