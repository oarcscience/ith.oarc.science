### THE SABBAT.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_DDD">DDD</span></span>The following
definition of the Sabbat is translated from the "Dictionnaire Infernal"
by Collins de Plancy, and is cited as a typical example of those
imbecilities which the Comte deprecates.

"The Sabbat is the assembly of devils, sorcerers and witches in their
nocturnal orgies. Usually they are there engaged in doing or in plotting
evil, in causing fear or terror, in preparing witchcraft and abominable
mysteries. The Sabbat is held at a place where several roads cross, or
in some deserted and wild spot near a lake, pool, or marsh, because
hailstorms are there made and tempests manufactured."
