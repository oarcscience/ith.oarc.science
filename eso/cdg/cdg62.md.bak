### MERLIN'S PROPHECY OF THE CONQUEST OF THE AIR AND OF AERIAL AND SUBMARINE WARFARE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_YY">YY</span></span>THE CONQUEST OF
THE AIR. "Nitentur, posteri transvolare superna." Posterity shall
endeavour to fly above the highest places.

### AERIAL WARFARE.

In tempore illo loquentur lapides & mare quo ad Galliam navigatur, infra
breve spacium contrahetur. In utraque ripa audietur homo ab homme, &
solidum insulæ dilatabitur. Revelabuntur occulta submarinorum & Gallia
præ timore tremebit.

Post hac ex Colaterio nemore procedet ardea, quæ insulam per biennium
circumvolabit. Nocturno clamore convocabit volatilia & omne genus
volucrum associabit sibi. In culturas mortalium irruent, & omnia grana
messium devocabunt (devocabunt) <span id="fr_218"></span>[\*](#fn_218.md)
Sequetur fames populum, atque dira mortalitas famen.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

### TRANSLATION.

At that. time stones shall speak, and th, sea where crossing is made to
go to Gaul shall be abridged to a short distance. A man upon one shore
shall be heard by a man upon the other, and the territory of the island
shall be enlarged. Hidden things under the sea shall be discovered, and
Gaul shall tremble for fear. After this a heron shall come forth from
the Colaterian Grove which shall fly about the island for two years.
With noturnal clamour she shall assemble the winged nations and shall
ally with herself all manner of flying things. They shall attack
agriculture and charm away (devour) all the grain of the harvests.
Famine shall result among the people and dire mortality from the famine.

### SUBMARINE WARFARE.

Favillæ rogi mutabuntur in cygnos, qui in sicco, quasi in flumine
natabunt. Devorabunt pisces in piscibus & homines in hominibus
deglutient. Superveniente vero senetute efficientur submarinæ luces
atque submarinas insidias machinabuntur. Submergent navalia & argentum
non minimum congregabunt.

The sparks of destruction shall be changed into swans which shall sail
upon dry ground as upon a river. They shall devour fishes among the
fishes and shall swallow up men among men. Indeed when the age grows
old <span id="fr_219"></span>[§](#fn_219.md) submarine lights shall be
skilfully contrived

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

and they shall plot submarine ambushes. They shall submerge naval
arsenals and collect not a little money.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_218"></span>[301:\*](cdg62.htm#fr_218.md) *Usual reading*.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[302:§](cdg62.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> *Superveniente vero Senectute*. These words
are usually taken to mean "But when old age comes upon them." Senectus,
however, has the meaning when used metonymically of "the old skin,
slough of serpents." <span id="fr_220"></span>[†](#fn_221.md)And since the
inventions described have been made in the present period when the Sun
behind the Sun <span id="fr_221"></span>[\*](#fn_220.md) is coming into
conjunction with the Sun of our Solar system and regenerating its Force,
Senectute appears to be an allusion to the skin of the World
Serpent--Solar Force--which presses upon it (*Superveniente*) as the age
grows old, and prior to the advent of that new epoch in evolution on
this planet which the closer approach of the Parent Sun ever initiates.
