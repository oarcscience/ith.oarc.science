### SIXTH PROPHECY.

### BIBLE PROPHECY OF WORLD PEACE DECLARING THE MANNER OF ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT.

How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that
publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they
sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again
Zion.

The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and
all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
extolled, and be very high.

So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at
him: *for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that
which they had not heard shall they consider*. <span
class="small">ISAIAH, CHAPTER lii., VERSES 7, 8, 10, 13, 15.</span>

### INTERPRETATION.

Proof that this prophecy has not been as yet fulfilled lies in the fad
that no Saviour has arisen whom the Jews have recognised as such;
whereas they were promised a messenger from God whom they should know,
"Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall know in
that day that I am he that doth speak:" ISAIAH lii, 6. Their prophets of
old

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

foretold the coming of a Giver of the Law to the Nations whom Israel
should acknowledge and follow. The covenant of the Most High is sure,
and the fulfillment of His promise shall not fail.

### MOUNTAINS.

The word mountains is often used in the Old Testament to signify those
higher levels of consciousness wherein the Law of God is understood and
obeyed. The prophet is able to ascend into these states of consciousness
and descending, retains and makes known to his fellowmen a knowledge of
divine concerns. Man in the flesh is encompassed by illusion, a wanderer
in the valley of the shadow. Let him lift up his eyes unto the hills
whence cometh his help, seeking "for the precious things of the lasting
hills," hearkening for "the sounding again of the mountains." <span
class="small">DEUTERONOMY xxxiii, 15. EZEKIEL. vii, 7.</span>

The feet upon the mountains are that manifestation of the Messenger
which is nearest to earth. Upon the higher levels of consciousness the
prophet is conscious of this Divine Influence to which the generality of
mankind are not at the period, consciously subject.

### WATCHMEN.

The meaning of the word watchmen is indicated by <span
class="small">*Ezekiel iii, 17*</span>. "Son of man, I have made thee a
watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth,
and give them warning from me." In this sense of the word, the watchmen
are the witnesses

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

of the Lord whose advent Muhammed foretells in his Prophecy of Truth.

The word "watchmen" has also an inner meaning which is revealed in <span
class="small">*Ecclesiasticus xxxvii, 14*</span>, where, after exhorting
the disciple to heed the counsel of his own heart (higher nature), the
Sage warns him against the danger of being led astray by the mind ever
the prey of illusion when not governed by the soul. "For a man's mind is
sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen, that sit above in an
high tower." Used in this sense, the word watchmen signifies the seven
principal ganglia of the sympathetic system <span
id="fr_237"></span>[†](#fn_237.md) which when awakened and energised by the
inflowing Solar Force establish in man superphysical states of
consciousness, and endow him with knowledge of the Law of Nature, God,
which wills obedience from all things. The answer given by the Oracle at
Delphi when questioned regarding Proclus sheds light upon the mystical
meaning of this verse, "Oft when the bolts. of thy mind willed of their
own impulse to follow crooked ways, the deathless ones set them aright
to move in their fixed curves and eternal path and gave to thine eyes
the frequent gleam of lights that from their night-shrouded watch-tower
they might clearly see." <span class="small">TRANSLATED FROM THE GREEK,
PORPHYRIUS,, DE VITA PLOTINI §22.</span>

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

### FOR THEY SHALL SEE EYE TO EYE.

That this inner meaning of the word watchmen is also intended is shown
by the explanatory phrase, "for they shall see eye to eye." The word eye
is not infrequently employed in the sacred writings of Israel to denote
these ganglia or focussing centres of the Divine Force, "Those seven;
they are the eyes of the Lord," <span class="small">*Zechariah iv,
10*</span>. To say that the watchmen shall see "eye to eye," is to say
that these ganglia shall be energised, and joined "eye to eye," by the
currents of the Solar Force, and that man shall become God-enlightened.

To arrive at a just estimate of Hebrew word values in the Old Testament,
it is necessary to bear in mind that the language and religion of Egypt
exercised an appreciable influence upon the Jews during their captivity.
The word "eye," used in the sense here noted, is an instance of this
influence. To the Egyptians, the "Sun behind the Sun" was known as
Osiris, <span id="fr_238"></span>[\*](#fn_238.md) whose name was written by
the hieroglyph of the eye, and also by that of the scarabeus. Of this
species of beetle, no female is known to exist. The male scarabeus pro-
duces the element of life, rolls it in a ball of earth, and leaves it to
be brought to birth by the warmth and life-giving force of the Sun.
Hence the scarabeus became the fitting symbol of the Divine or Solar
Spark in man, placed in the earth sphere that it may be regenerated and
brought to "the birth from above" by

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

the rays of the Solar Force. <span id="fr_239"></span>[†](#fn_239.md) "The
so-called scarabeus, the great cockchafer of southern countries, was
considered an especially mysterious and sacred animal, and the figure of
this insect was almost as symbolic to the followers of the Egyptian
religion as the cross is to the  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[§](#fn_240.md)Christian." <span
id="fr_241"></span>[‡](#fn_241.md) Under the New Empire, the Egyptians
replaced the heart of the dead by a stone scarabeus, emblem of
Osiris, <span id="fr_242"></span>[\*](#fn_242.md) and, as it were, a finite
symbol of the Omnipotent Eye of the Sun behind the Sun, and an enduring
expression of their prayer that the departed soul might receive that
Creative Light which would perfect its immortal evolution and bring it
to the Everlasting Land. This use of the scarabeus bears mute witness to
the fad that there existed in Ancient Egypt, knowledge concerning that
centre in the human heart whose awakening or 'lifting up' to a higher
plane of evolution or consciousness reveals to man the vista of his
immortal destiny. A proof that Israel also had this knowledge is found
in <span class="small">*Ecclesiaticus xvii, 8*</span>. " He set his eye
upon their hearts, that he might shew them the greatness of his works."

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

Primarily applied to the manifestation of the force of the Sun behind
the Sun in the human heart, the word eye came in course of time to
denote the centres of the cerebro-spinal <span
id="fr_243"></span>[\*](#fn_243.md) and sympathetic nervous systems, and
especially the seven principal centres of the latter, whose perfe&ing
brings man into greater knowledge and love of God. "For the eyes of the
Lord are upon them that love him, he is their mighty protection and
strong stay, a defence from heat, and a cover from the Sun at noon, a
preservation from stumbling, and an help from falling. He raiseth up the
soul, and lighteneth the eyes: he giveth health, life, and blessing."
<span class="small">*Ecclesiasticus xxxiv, 16, 17*</span>. "The statutes
of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord
is pure, enlightening the eyes." <span class="small">*PSALM XIX,
8*.</span>

### THE LORD HATH LAID BARE HIS HOLY ARM.

The word here translated Lord is "YHWH, the (ineffable) name of God."
"These substitutions of 'Adonay' and Elohim' for YHWH were devised to
avoid the profanation of the Ineffable Name." <span
id="fr_244"></span>[†](#fn_244.md) But Elohim, exoteric name of YHWH
(Jehovah), is the Sun behind the Sun. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[‡](#fn_245.md) The holy arm of the Lord is therefore
seen to be a ray of its Divine Force. This Force is more or less potent
on earth according to cyclic law. At the beginning and end of the age,
the Sun

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

behind the Sun is in conjunction with the .Sun of our Solar System, and
its energy, descending deep into matter, brings to birth God-enlightened
men; which the prophet states figuratively when he says that this Divine
or Super-Solar Force shall manifest "in the eyes of all the nations."
"Awake, awake, pat on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the
ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut
Rahab, and wounded the dragon. <span id="fr_246"></span>[\*](#fn_246.md)?"
<span class="small">*Isaiah li, 9*.</span>

### SO SHALL HE SPRINKLE MANY NATIONS.

And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of
purifying upon them, <span class="small">*Numbers viii, 7*</span>. Then
will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean. . . A new
heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you. . .
. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my
statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. <span
class="small">EZEKIEL xxxvi, EXTRACTS VERSES 25-27</span>.

### CONCLUSION.

This prophecy foretells the cyclic return of that Force, subtle in
character but positive in demand, which proceeds from the Lord and Giver
of Life, the Great Architect of the Universe, the Supreme Source. This
Divine Ray liberates the souls of its servants in every nation that they
may labour as one for the establishment of Truth, Justice and Peace.
