### BEHEMOTH AND LEVIATHAN.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_FF">FF</span></span>In Athanasius' "
Life of St. Antony," at the words, "the weapons which are 'in the navel
of his belly,'" <span id="fr_189"></span>[\*](#fn_189.md) reference is made
to the parallel passage in Job xl, 16, where the Lord says of Behemoth,
"his force is in the navel of his belly," and it is stated that "the
descriptions of behemoth and leviathan are allegorically referred to
Satan." Therefore we hope to give some clue to the identity of Behemoth
and Leviathan, what they are, and how they manifest.

EHEMOTH. JOB xl, 6.--Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the
whirlwind, and said,

14\. Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can
save thee.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This verse states that man may become his own saviour, affording a key
to the allegory which follows.

</div>

15\. Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Bĕhēmōth is no doubt an intensive plural form, and means 'a colossal
beast.'" <span id="fr_190"></span>[†](#fn_190.md) Behemoth symbolises the
beast in man, the vital energy or Solar Force manifesting ungo,verned in
the lower or animal nature of man. <span id="fr_191"></span>[‡](#fn_191.md)

</div>

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

he eateth grass as an ox.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Grass here signifies the flesh or carnal nature. "All flesh is grass."
<span class="small">ISAIAH xl, 6.</span> The ox is an unsexed animal,
hence "he eateth grass as an ox" is equivalent to saying that Behe moth
(the vital energy) can, or was intended to, consume the carnal nature of
man by manifesting unsexed; for regeneration as opposed to ungoverned
sex expression or generation.

</div>

16\. Lo now, his strength is in his loins,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Loins in Hebrew as in Greek is used as a euphemism for the organs of
generation. During the present cycle of evolution the strength or power
of the Solar Force <span id="fr_192"></span>[\*](#fn_193.md) is manifesting
in sex expression.

</div>

and his force is in the navel of his belly.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The shining, vital energy which is the manifestation of life . . . is
sleeping like a serpent, having three and a half coils." <span
id="fr_193"></span>[§](#fn_192.md) The first stirring or uncoiling of this
force prior to its passage through and energising of the ganglia of the
sympathetic system manifests in the abdomen in the region of the navel.
In chapter xxxii, 18, 19; 8, of the Book of Job, the Initiate Elihu
describes this stirring

</div>

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

of the vital energy or Solar Force when speaking under divine
inspiration, "the spirit of my belly constraineth me, Behold, my belly
is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles. I
will speak, that I may be refreshed, but there is a spirit in man: and
the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding."

</div>

18\. His bones are pipes of copper; his bones are like tubes of
iron. <span id="fr_194"></span>[†](#fn_194.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The bones of Behemoth are the net work of nerves which are the channels
of the Solar Force. Prior to Initiation these nerves are in the
atrophied or, relatively speaking, hardened state here typified as
copper and iron. In Sanskrit writings these channels are similarly
termed pipes or tubes (nadis). The Uttara Gita states that these nadis
"are like pipes, are hollow and in this space there exists a certain
substance, like oil, in which the Chaitanya (Divine Energy)
reflects." <span id="fr_195"></span>[§](#fn_195.md) In the fourth chapter
of Zechariah the word "pipes" is used in this sense. "And I said, I have
looked, and behold a candlestick (the spine) all of gold, with a bowl
upon the top of it," ("The golden bowl is the

</div>

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

brain," <span id="fr_196"></span>[†](#fn_196.md) or accurately speaking the
*medulla oblongata* which is a reservoir of vital force,) and his seven
lamps thereon, (the seven principal ganglia), and seven pipes to the
seven lamps."

"And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive
branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil"
(namely the nerve fluid in which the radiance of the Solar Force is
reflected or manifested). <span class="small">ZECHARIAH iv, 2,
12</span>.

</div>

19\. He is chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword
to approach unto him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behemoth is the chief manifestation to man of Nature, God. The God in
man can govern Behemoth. The sword is the symbol of authority,
government and the Great Law of Nature, God.

</div>

20\. Surely the mountains bring him forth food,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In sacred writings the word 'mountain' is often used to signify those
higher levels of consciousness wherein the Seeker attains to communion
with God, and the Divine Self is able to instruct the man through the
instrument of the mind. Thus Moses went up into the mount to receive the
Law: and Isaiah foretells that spiritual enlightenment

</div>

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

which is the destiny of the race in these words, "And in this mountain
(the higher consciousness) shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people
a feast,--And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
cast over all people, and the wail (of forgetfulness) that is spread
over all nations. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God;
we have waited for him, and he will save us: For in this mountain shall
the hand of the Lord rest." <span id="fr_197"></span>[\*](#fn_197.md) The
Divine Principle manifesting in the higher consciousness of man shall
bring him into harmony with the Law of Nature, God.

</div>

20\. where all the beasts of the field play.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Presumably a reference to those streams of consciousness or Divine Force
playing through the signs of the Zodiac known as the ram, bull, and
goat--of which the spirit of man when functioning in the mountain or
higher states of consciousness is aware, and from which he can gain
knowledge of of the government of Behemoth.

</div>

23\. he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan (salvation) into his mouth.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Behemoth, the Solar Force manifesting in

</div>

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

lower nature of man trusteth that it can, through upward direction
approach and quicken the Solar Principle in man and through the
evolution of man's divine nature achieve his salvation.

</div>

24\. He taketh it with his eyes:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The eyes of Behemoth are the seven principal ganglia of the sympathetic
nervous system. " Those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord,"
Zechariah, iv, 10. Man works out his own salvation through the awakening
of these centres.

</div>

24\. his nose pierceth through snares.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Already the Solar Force seeks to manifest in upward direction for the
regeneration of man and the race, though ensnared by the baser
inclinations and ignorance.

| ![L](img/27400.jpg.md) |

EVIATHAN. JOB xl, 1.--Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The word Leviathan in Hebrew is made up of two roots, Levi and Than.
"ThN, Than, which is the root of Serpent or Dragon. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md) Than will be the symbol of
transgression, but a symbol also of influence and of power." <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md) Since the root meaning of Than is
serpent, Leviathan means literally the Than or serpent of Levi. Of this
word Levi "The root, we may suppose, describes the coils of the serpent,
perhaps the metallic gleam of its scales." <span
id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_200.md) For Levi was the serpent tribe, bred for
generations to the knowledge and control of the World Serpent, Solar
Force. <span id="fr_201"></span>[\*](#fn_201.md) Leviathan or the Serpent
of Levi signifies the Solar Force governed and direted upward through
the spine by the priests of the tribe of Levi for regeneration, the
upbuilding of the deathless Solar Body. <span
id="fr_202"></span>[†](#fn_202.md) Accurately speaking, Leviathan is the
Solar Force manifesting in the cerebrospinal nervous system after its
passage through the ganglia of the sympathetic system.

</div>

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

5\. or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

substantiates this statement. For it is only after the upward passage of
the Solar Force through the spine that the tongue of Leviathan can be
drawn out. When the Solar Force is directed upward it passes through an
opening in the top of the head called by the Brahmins the "door of
Brahma," and by the first Christians the "door of Jesus," and is visible
to the seer as a tongue of brilliant flame.

The following verses make reference to the various temptations which
beset Job, overcoming of which mark different degrees in his Initiation.

</div>

3\. Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words
unto thee?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Will you even now be tempted to misapply this force? The current would
descend if possible, for it becomes either a regenerator or a destroyer,
intensifying the lower nature.

</div>

5\. or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Until a man is able so to govern his lower nature, mind, and body as to
express his higher or Divine Self in sex relationship he has not passed
that stage in the evolution of his Godhood typified in ancient myths as

</div>

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

the slaying of the lion or dragon. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[\*](#fn_203.md) Samson slew the lion after his lower
nature had been roused by his love for a daughter of the Philistines.
And Hercules overcame the Nemean lion after the fifty daughters of King
Thespius had been given him as wives. This verse alludes to a definite
degree of Initiation, an experience wherein the passions are overcome by
a manifestation of the God in man.

</div>

6\. shall they part him among the merchants?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Will you sell the superhuman powers where with the God in self endows
you for personal advantage or money?

</div>

7\. Wilt thou fill . . . the cabin of fishes with his head? <span
id="fr_204"></span>[†](#fn_204.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The word "Dag" or "the Fish" is frequently used in the Talmud for the
Messiah or regenerative spiritual force. When man becomes his own
saviour this force passes upward to the brain, where its currents unite
for the perfecting of the Solar or spiritual body. The cabin of fishes
would seem to

</div>

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

designate the skull containing the brain where the currents of the Solar
Force focus for regeneration. Thus "there is no head above the head of a
serpent" <span id="fr_205"></span>[\*](#fn_205.md) <span
class="small">*Ecclesiasticus, 25, 15*</span>, Will you be able to fill
the reservoir of regenerative force situated in the brain? is the
meaning of this verse.

</div>

8\. Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

These words indicate that Leviathan is a conquered or governed force;
indeed, Leviathan is Behemoth governed and augmented. The battle or test
referred to is supreme and terrible. Plato says in the Phaedrus, "But
whenever one who is fresh from those mysteries" beholds beauty of face
and form "he first of all feels a shuddering chill, and there creep over
him some of those terrors that assailed him in that dire struggle." In
the elder Edda, that voice of the ancient religions of the north, this
degree of Initiation is described as follows: "Comes forth the glorious
offspring of Earth, Thor, to strive with the glistening Serpent. . . .
Lone Serpent-slayer, and Shield of Men, he baited his hook with the head
of the ox, and he whom the gods hate gaped thereat,

</div>

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

the Girdle lying all lands beneath. Then Thor drew mightily--swift in
his doing--the poison-glistening snake to the side. His hammer he lifted
and struck from on high the fearful head. . . . Moaned the wild monster,
the rocks all rumbled, the ancient earth shrank into itself. . . . Then
sank the serpent down in the deep."

ELDER EDDA, COMMENTARY CONCLUDED</span>.

</div>

10\. None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand
before me?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

None is so fierce that dare stir him up:--meaning Leviathan or the Solar
Force governed, who then is able to stand before me, the Architet of the
Universe, and before my manifestation the Super Solar Force?

</div>

11\. Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Repay is here used in the Hebrew with the sense of "give an equivalent
for." What has prevented the substitution of the Super Solar Force for
the Solar Force, of immortality for mortality?

</div>

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

### PART II.

At this point the allegory changes in character. Hitherto Leviathan or
the Initiatory Force has been described figuratively and somewhat
ambiguously. Henceforward the writer intends to make a more explicit and
unmistakeable revelation of his meaning.

12\. I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
proportion.

13\. Who can strip off his outer garment?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The outer garment of Leviathan is the voltage of Solar Force manifesting
in the sympathetic nervous system. Who can replace this by the voltage
necessary to open. and perfect the centres of the cerebro-spinal system?

</div>

13\. or who can come to him with his double bridle?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

After passing through the centres of the sympathetic nervous system, the
positive and negative currents of Solar Force meet in the forehead
where, as it were, their balance registers; so that at this degree of
evolution the Initiate can sense whether the balance is perfedf, or
whether positive or negative current predominates. This power to sense
and govern the currents is hère called the double bridle of
Leviathan. <span id="fr_206"></span>[†](#fn_206.md) And the Adept Kings of
Egypt bore upon their

</div>

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

foreheads the uraeus, or sacred serpent, emblem of this bridle, to
signify that they had achieved this power. Hence "The Chaldee Paraphrase
understands 'leviathan that piercing serpent' to refer to Pharaoh."
(<span class="small">*Isaiah xxvii, 1*,</span>) Leviathan is also
thought to personify the King of Egypt in Psalm lxxiv, 14, "Thou brakest
the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gayest him to be meat to the
people inhabiting the wilderness," meaning that Moses transmitted as
meat to the children of Israel knowledge of the Serpent Fire or Solar
Force, hitherto the prerogative of Egypt's Adept Kings and their
priests:

</div>

15\. His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The word translated scales has the literal meaning in Hebrew of 'strong
pieces of shields,' and is used to designate the ganglia which "are shut
up together as with a close seal" prior to Initiation. The word seal is
used similarly in the Apocalypse when St. John says of the seven
principal ganglia of the sympathetic system, "I saw when the Lamb (the
immortal mind) opened one of the seven seals." <span
class="small">REVELATION vi, 1</span>.

</div>

18\. By his neesings a light doth shine,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The neesings of Leviathan characterise what

</div>

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

may be described as the whisking of the Solar Force through and about
the Initiate which at every pronounced increase of voltage causes
greater illumination, to the seer, actually visible as light. See
[Frontispiece](cdg00.htm#img_front.md).

21\. His breath kindleth coals,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Divine Energy or Fire <span id="fr_207"></span>[\*](#fn_207.md)
enkindles the ganglia. Or this verse may be taken literally, for when
the Solar Force has reached and energised a certain ganglion the
Initiate is able to enkindle substances by directing the Solar Force
upon them through the medium of the breath.

</div>

22\. and sorrow is turned into joy before him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The suffering experienced in the physical body during the period when
the centres are energised is transmuted into the joy of divine
realisation.

</div>

27\. He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

his is an allusion to xl, 18, the "pipes of copper and tubes of iron,"
or the nervous systems, channels of the Divine Energy, which adapt
themselves for the conveyance of this Force.

</div>

33\. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Literally to 'those who behave themselves

</div>

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

without fear,' who can fearlessly govern Leviathan.

</div>

Job xlii, 1. Then Job answered the Lord, and said,

2\. I know that thou canst do everything, and that no thought of thine
can be hindered. <span id="fr_208"></span>[\*](#fn_208.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Job after his Illumination recognises and is non-resistant to the Law of
Nature, God, which wills obedience from all things.

</div>
