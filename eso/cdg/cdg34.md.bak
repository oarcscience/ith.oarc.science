### JUSTIN MARTYR'S STATEMENT.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_X">X</span></span>"Neither will it
be difficult for you to learn the true religion in some measure from
that antient Sybil, who, by a very powerful inspiration, instructs you
in her oracular responses, and which come nearest to the dodtrine of the
prophets.

Of this Sybil it is reported that she was driven out of Babylon: that
she was the daughter of Berosus who wrote the history of the Chaldeans:
that by some means or other, she came and settled at Cumæ in Campania,
six miles from the hot baths at Baiæ, where she delivered her oracles.
And when we were at Cumæ, we saw the place, wherein was a prodigious
Basilic all cut out of one stone, a stupendous and amazing work. Here
this Sybil gave forth her oracles, as the people, from an unquestioned
tradition of their forefathers, informed us. In the midst of this
Basilic were three cisterns hewn out of the Basilic itself, in which,
being filled with water, the Sybil used to bathe: then, slipping on her
loose garb, retired into the inmost recess of the Basilic, which also
was cut out of the same stone; where sitting on an exalted throne, she
delivered her oracles.

Many have made mention of this Sybil, as of an undoubted Oracle,
particularly Plato in his Phaedrus: for it seems to me that Plato,
meeting with her oracles, ascribed an inspiration to the author. He saw
her predictions accomplished, and, struck with admiration,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

in his book to Menon, speaks in praise of the prophetess in this
punctilious manner: 'If we rightly account those persons divine who are
endowed with the gift of prophecy, are not those also inspired and
agitated by a divine impulse, and possessed of the God, who declare many
things about the most weighty affairs very justly, at the same time not
understanding any of those things whereof they then speak.'

It is very clear and evident that Plato in this had an eye to the
Sybil's verses: for she had not, like the poets, a power to revise and
correct her own works, and thereby adjust them to poetical measures: but
she, in the very time of her inspiration, finished her prophecy; and the
moment that that inflatus ceased, that moment she forgot all she had
said; for which reason the measures of her verses are not all of them
entire.

Finally, O Grecians, unless you esteem the deceitful representation of
the imaginary gods of these men, as more precious than your own
salvation, hearken, as I said before, to what that antient Sybil saith
(whose books are preserved throughout the world) of those who are called
gods, for she instructs you, by a powerful inspiration, in her oracles
that there are no gods, and moreover clearly foretold the coming of our
Saviour Jesus Christ, and all those things which he should perform: for
the knowledge of these things will be a necessary preparatory induction
to the holy scriptures."

### JUSTIN MARTYR MEETS A MASTER.

Justin Martyr lived at Neapolis during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and
suffered death for the faith of his Fathers the Philosophers, about 165
A.D. From youth he sought ardently for knowledge of the Truth, and in
his own writings gives an account of his receiving the "Salutation of
the Sages." He states that his investigation into the various
philosophies of the day resulted in conviction that he would find the
true path to God through Platonism. He therefore gave himself up to the
rigorous mental discipline and meditation which that school enjoined
upon its neophytes. During this period "Wishing to be filled with
quietness and to shun the paths of men, I used to walk by myself in a
field near the sea. One day an old man of gentle and venerable
appearance followed me at a little distance. I stopped and turning round
fixed my eyes keenly upon him."

"Dost thou know me?" he asked.

I replied that I did not.

"Why then dost thou look so intently at me?"

"Because," I said, "I had not expected to see any man here."

"I am anxious," he replied, "about some absen

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

members of my family, and I am come to look out whether they would come
in sight from any quarter."

A remarkable discussion ensued in which the messenger of the Sages made
plain to Justin the futility of an intellectualism unvivified by spirit,
such as was manifest in the Stoic, Peripatetic, Pythagorean, and even
Platonic philosophies at that period. At last Justin said, as so many
other baffled thinkers have done before and since, "Whom then, shall a
man take as his Master, or whence shall he derive any instruction if the
truth is not with these philosophers?"

"There once lived men called prophets," answered his instruolor, "who
were anterior to any of those who are considered philosophers and who
were blessed, just, and beloved by God. They were filled with the Divine
Spirit and foretold future events which are now atually taking place.
And they alone knew and taught the Truth neither regarding nor fearing
any man, nor being carried away by personal love of glory but declaring
only those things which they saw and heard when filled with the Divine
Spirit. Their writings are extant, and whoever reads them will derive
much instrution about the first principles and the end of things,
together with all that a philosopher ought to know when he believes
them. They have not indeed used demonstration in their treatises for
they were verily as faithful witnesses of the Truth above all
demonstration. . . They glorified God, the Father and

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Creator of all
things and proclaimed His Son, the Christ whom He has sent. *Pray
therefore above all things that the gates of light may be opened to
thee*, for these things cannot be perceived or understood by all, but
only by him to whom God and His Christ have given understanding."

"When he had thus spoken he went away; and I saw him no more. But
straightway *a flame was kindled in my Soul*, and a love of the Prophets
and of the friends of Christ took possession of me; and revolving his
words in my mind I found this Philosophy alone to be sound and
profitable." FROM "THE DIALOGUES OF ST. JUSTIN MARTYR WITH TRYPHO THE
JEW." § 104, § I09. TRANSLATION BASED UPON EDWARD BACKHOUSE, "EARLY
CHURCH HISTORY," PAGES 29-31.

In the early Christian Church the word Christ was used as a synonym for
the Solar Principle in man. "But if Christ is in you, though your body
must die because of sin, yet your Spirit has life because of
righteousness." ROMANS viii, 10.
