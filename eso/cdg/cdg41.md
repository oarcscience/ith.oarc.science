### SLEEP.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_EE">EE</span></span>"In sleep the
soul is vigorous, and free from the senses, and the obstruction of the
cares of the body, which lies prostrate and deathlike.... When we are
not asleep, our faculties are employed on the necessary affairs of life,
and so are hindered from communication with the Deity by the bondage of
the body.... When the soul of man is disengaged from corporeal
impediments and set at freedom,--in sleep,--it beholds those wonders
which, when entangled beneath the veil of the flesh, it is unable to
see," says Cicero in his treatise "On Divination." <span
id="fr_187"></span>[\*](#fn_187.md) And this truth regarding the emergence
of the Soul from the body during sleep, as well as the Soul's consequent
closer union with the Divine Principle, is also set forth in the Koran
Sura xxxix, The Troops. " God taketh souls unto Himself at death; and
during their sleep those who do not die: and He retaineth those on which
He hath passed a decree of death, but sendeth the others back till a
time that is fixed. Herein are signs for the refledting."

Freed from the bondage of the body and the trammels of space and time in
sleep, the soul desiring light is able to seek those great souls and
sources ever flooding humanity with the out-pourings of divine love and
wisdom. Thus are the words of Christ fulfilled, "Ask, and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you: For every one

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that
knocketh it shall be opened." <span id="fr_188"></span>[\*](#fn_188.md)
Whatever the limitations of an individual's temporal experience, they
cannot fetter the immortal spirit and soul, which in sleep attain those
realms of consciousness whose memories, because of the imperfetions of
the instrument, may filter but dimly into the waking mind, yet
inevitably tindure it and the entire life of the man.

"In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,
in slumberings upon the bed;

Then He (God) openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instrudtion."
<span class="small">JOB xxxiii, 15, 16</span>.
