### SECOND PROPHECY.

### THE SIBYLLINE PROPHECY OF WORLD PEACE AND THE REIGN OF JUSTICE.

The Kingdom of God shall come upon good Men; for the Earth, which is the
producer of all things, shall yield to Men the best, and infinite
Fruits; . . . and the Cities shall be full of good Men, and the Fields
shall be fruitful, and there shall be no War in the Earth, nor Tumult,
nor shall the Earth groan by an Earthquake; no Wars, nor Drought, or
Famine; nor Hail to waste the Fruits; but there shall be great Peace in
all the Earth, and one King shall live in Friendship with the other, to
the End of the Age; and the Immortal, who lives in the Heavens adorned
with Stars, shall give a common Law to all Men in all the Earth, and
instruct miserable Men what things must be done; for he is the only God,
and there is no other; and *he shall burn the great Strength of Men by
Fire*.

Then he shall raise a Kingdom for ever over all Men, when he hath given
a Holy Law to the Righteous, to all whom he promised to open the Earth;
and the World of the blessed, and all Joys, and an immortal Mind, and
Eternal chearfulness. Out of every Country they shall bring
Frankincense, and Gifts to the Houses of the Great God, and there shall
be no other House to be enquired for by the Generations

of Men that are to come, but the faithful Man whom God has given to be
worshiped, for Mortals call him the Son of the Great God; and all the
Paths of the Fields, and rough Shores, and high Mountains, and the
raging Waves of the Sea, shall be easily passed, or sailed through in
those Days for all Peace shall happen to the Good, through all their
Land, the Prophets of the Great God shall take away all Slaughter, for
they are the Judges of Mortals, and the righteous Kings. And there shall
be just Riches for Men, for the Government of the Great God shall be
just Judgement. <span id="fr_223"></span>[†](#fn_223.md)

Now no longer shall gold and silver be full of guile, nor shall there be
possessing of land nor toilsome slavery; but one love and one ordering
of life in kindness of soul. All things shall be common and light equal
in the lives of men. Vice shall leave the earth and be sunk in the
divine ocean. Then is the summer of mortal men nigh at hand. Strong
necessity will be laid upon (the world) that these things be
accomplished. No wayfarer meeting another will then say: "The race of
mortal men, though now they perish, shall some day have rest." And then
a holy people shall wield the sceptre of the whole world through all the
ages, along with their mighty offspring. <span class="small">TRANSLATED
