### JAPHET.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_MM">MM</span></span>The Comte's
identification of Zoroaster with Japhet is merely a manner of stating
that these names represent equivalent manifestations of the same Divine
Force. In Masonry the Cabalistic tradition as to this Force has been
maintained. When the order of Knights Templar was founded, supposedly by
Hugh, Godfrey and others, their leader was in reality a Master whose
true name and identity remained unknown,--in reverent memory of whom, as
the source from which they received their instruéion, they erected in
the seven towered walls of their cities of refuge, one tower higher than
the rest, and facing towards the East which they called the tower of
Japhet.

### ZOROASTER.

"'The sun is sometimes called in Persian *Zartushti* or *tasht-i-zer*,
the golden orb (zer, gold; tasht, a disk). And in honour of the sun, I
conceive, was named the celebrated philosopher *Zerdusht*, whom the
Greeks have called *Zoroaster*, retaining the first part of his name,
but altering the -se.cond, into Αστρον, equivalent in their language to
the Persian *tasht*, an orb or disk.' It may be added, that the first
Zoroaster was evidently mythical (probably a mere name for the sun
himself)."
