<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_J">J</A></FONT></span>"The serpent, separate or in combination with the j circle, egg, or globe, has been a predominant symbol among many primitive nations. It prevailed in Egypt, Greece, and Assyria, and entered widely into the superstitions of the Celts, the Hindoos, and the Chinese. It even penetrated into America; and was conspicuous in the mythology of the ancient Mexicans, among whom its significance does not seem to have differed materially from that which it possessed in the old world. The fad that the ancient Celts, and perhaps other nations of the old continent, erected sacred structures</p>

<p>in the form of the serpent, is one of high interest. Of this description was the great temple of Abury, in England,--in many respects the most imposing ancient monument of the British islands."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A celebrated example of the egg and serpent symbol is found in Adams County, Ohio, United States of America. It is an enduring witness to the fad that knowledge of the God-Mystery existed in North America at an early period. "It is situated on a high spur of land, which rises a hundred and fifty feet above Brush Creek. 'Conforming to the curve of the hill, and occupying its very summit, is the serpent, its head resting near the point, and its body winding back for seven hundred feet, in graceful undulations, terminating in a triple coil at the tail. The entire length, if extended, would be not less than one thousand feet. The work is clearly and boldly defined, the embankment being upwards of five feet in height, by thirty feet base at the centre of the body, but diminishing somewhat toward the head and tail. The neck of the serpent is stretched out, and slightly curved, and its mouth is opened wide, as if in the ad of swallowing or ejeting an oval figure, which rests partially within the distended jaws. This oval is formed by an embankment of earth, without any perceptible opening, four feet in height, and is perfectly regular in outline, its transverse and conjugate diameters being one hundred</p>

<p>and sixty, and eighty feet respectively.' When, why, or by whom these remarkable works were erected, as yet we know not. The present Indians, though they look upon them with reverence, can throw no light upon their origin."</p>
