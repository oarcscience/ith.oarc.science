### GERTRUDE, NUN OF THE MONASTERY OF NAZARETH IN THE DIOCESE OF COLOGNE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_QQ">QQ</span></span>"Now this evil
had begun with a certain Gertrude who had been shut up in the monastery
at the age of fourteen. . . Moreover, I found out that the said girl had
written to her lover outrageous letters, which were later discovered
during the course of the investigation made by me in the same college on
25th May, A.D. 1565, in the presence of that man of eminent nobility and
wisdom Constantine of Lyskerk, a most worthy magistrate, of John Altena
formerly Dean of Cleves, of John Echte a most accomplished physician,
and of my son Henry, doctor of philosophy and medicine, that these
letters, however, were produced by her while possessed of the devil and
not in her sound senses is open to no reasonable doubt." <span
