### CHERUBIM,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_AAA">AAA</span></span>Signifies in
Hebrew fulness of knowledge. This name is used by Cabalists to denote
Beings of that Heavenly Hierarchy ranking below the Seraphim, and
charged with the duty of adjudging and of answering prayers according to
the Law. Ezekiel thus describes them, "their appearance was like burning
coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down
among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire
went forth lightenings." <span class="small">EZEKIEL i, 13</span>.
