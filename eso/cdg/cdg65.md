### PROCLUS ON PRAYER.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_BBB">BBB</span></span>"To a perfect
and true prayer however, there is required a conformation of our life
with that which is divine; and this accompanied with all purity,
chastity, discipline, and order, through which our concerns being
introduced to the Gods, we shall attract their benificence, and our
souls will become subject to them. In the third place, contact is
necessary, according to which we touch the divine essence with the
summit of our soul, and verge to a union with it. But there is yet
farther required, an approximating adhesion: for thus the oracle calls
it, when it says, *the mortal approximating to fire will possess a light
from the Gods*. <span id="fr_222"></span>[\*](#fn_222.md) For this imparts
to us a greater communion with, and a more manifest participation of the
light of the Gods.

In the last place, union succeeds establishing *the one* of the soul in
*the one* of the Gods, and causing our energy to become one with divine
energy; according to which we are no longer ourselves, but are absorbed
as it were in the Gods, *abiding in divine light, and circularly
comprehended by it*. And this is the best end of true prayer, in order
that the conversion of the soul may be conjoined with its permanency,
and that everything which proceeds from *the one* of the Gods, may again
be established in *the one*, and the light which is in us may be
comprehended in the light of the Gods. Prayer therefore, is no small
part of the

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

whole ascent of souls. Nor is he who possesses virtue superior to the
want of the good which proceeds from prayer. The perfedion however of
prayer, beginning from more common goods, ends in divine union, and
gradually accustoms the soul to divine light.

All nations likewise, that have excelled in wisdom, have diligently
applied themselves to prayer."
