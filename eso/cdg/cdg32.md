### 1450 A.D. CELIUS RHODIGINUS, 1525 A.D. LOUIS RICCHIERI RHODIGINUS.

An Italian philologist who made a valuable and ably annotated collection
of the opinions of the ancient Greek and Latin scholars on occult and
other subjects.

### ORACLE OF CELIUS RHODIGINUS.

Lest any one think that this story ought to be laughed at as fabulous, I
desire it to be put on record, now at this time, and indeed while I am
dealing with the matter, that there was in my native country a woman of
humble origin named Jacoba from whose abdomen, I myself, yes and
numberless others, not only at Rovigo but throughout well nigh the whole
of Italy, heard the voice of an unclean spirit, excessively thin, to be
sure, but nevertheless when it so desired articulate and perfectly
intelligible. It would frequently happen that men of high position being

no secret fraud might be concealed, they would watch and listen to her
with great eagerness.

Little Cincinnatus was the name of the demon, an appellation in which he
took great pleasure and to which he would immediately reply when called
upon.

If you inquired about matters of the past or present, however hidden
they might be, he often gave marvellous answers; but if you asked about
the future he was always a hopeless deceiver, sometimes he used to
reveal his ignorance by a doubtful whispering or more unmistakably by an
unintelligible buzzing.
