### PLATO ON MAN'S PLACE IN NATURE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_Z">Z</span></span>"But with respect
to the most principal and excellent species of the soul, we should
conceive as follows: that divinity assigned this to each of us as a
dæmon; and that it resides in the very summit of the body, elevating us
from earth to an alliance with the heavens; as *we are not terrestial
plants, but blossoms of heaven*. And this indeed is most truly asserted.
For from whence the first generation of the soul arose, from thence a
divine nature being suspended from our head and root, directs and
governs the whole of our corporeal frame. In him therefore who
vehemently labours to satisfy the cravings of desire and ambition, all
the conceptions of his soul must be necessarily mortal; and himself as
much as possible must become entirely mortal, since he leaves nothing
unaccomplished which tends to increase his perishable part. But it is
necessary

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

that he who is sedulously employed in the acquisition of knowledge, who
is anxious to acquire the wisdom of truth, and who employs his most
vigorous exertions in this one pursuit;--it is perfectly necessary that
such a one, if he touches on the truth, should be endued with wisdom
about immortal and divine concerns; and that he should participate of
immortality, as far as human nature permits, without leaving any part of
it behind. And besides, as such a one always cultivates that which is
divine, and has a dæmon most excellently adorned residing in his
essence, he must be happy in the most eminent degree. But the culture of
all the parts is indeed entirely one, and consists in assigning proper
nutriment and motion to each. But the motions which are allied to the
divine part of our nature, are the cogitative energies and circulations
of the universe. These therefore each of us ought to pursue; restoring
in such a manner those revolutions in our head (which have been
corrupted by our wandering about generation), through diligently
considering the harmonies and circulations of the universe, that the
intellective power may become assimilated to the objet of intelligence,
according to its ancient nature. For when thus assimilated, we shall
obtain the end of the best life proposed by the gods to men, both at
present and in all the future circulations of time." "THE TIMAEUS OF
PLATO." TRANSLATED BY THOMAS TAYLOR. PAGES 550-551, EDITION 1793.
