### Ancient Persian Monument.

ANCIENT PERSIAN MONUMENT.--Throughout antiquity it was usual
symbolically to represent the lower nature and passions of man, or
accurately speaking the Solar Force manifesting in them ungoverned, as a
lion, <span id="fr_143"></span>[\*](#fn_143.md) the king of beasts, whose
conquest must precede all spiritual development. Thus the first labour
of the Greek saviour Hercules is said to have been the slaying of a huge
lion, his lower physical nature. And the initial exploit of the Hebrew
hero Samson is described as follows: "And, behold, a young lion roared
against him. And the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and he
rent him as he would have rent a kid,, and he had nothing in his hand."
This subordination of the lower nature to the higher in man or
government of the generative force that it may ascend and be employed
for regeneration, the upbuilding of the Solar or Spiritual Body, is here
represented. The lion symbolises the lower nature of man, and the
serpent the Solar Force directed upward which is overcoming it.

"I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God
might manifest them, and that they might see (literally, that they might
clear God, and see) that they themselves are beasts. Who knoweth the
spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth
downward to the earth?" ECCLESIASTES iii., 18, 2I.
