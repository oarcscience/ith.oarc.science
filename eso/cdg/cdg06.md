HERMES, the messenger of the gods, was said by the Greeks to typify and
preside over the powers of the mind and to be the patron of gymnastic
games. He is represented as bearing a caduceus or staff, gift of Apollo
the Sun God, and emblem of the God's message to mankind. This staff
represents the spine containing the cerebro spinal nervous system which
is the wand of the magician, while the two intertwining serpents which
ascend symbolise the positive and negative currents of  
Solar Force directed upward for the stimulation and  
evolution of the Solar Principle in man.  
Upon his left arm Hermes bears the  
Infant Bacchus, the Redeemer.  
COMPARE BACCHUS AND OSIRIS,
