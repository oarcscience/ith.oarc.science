### KING RODRIGUEZ WARNING, 711 A.D.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_CC">CC</span></span>"Now it came to
pass that the King Don Rodrigo called to mind how he had been required
to put a lock upon the doors of the house which was in Toledo. And after
they were unlocked, the king pushed the door with his hand, and he went
in, and the chief persons who were there with him, and they found a hall
made in a square, and in it there was a bed richly fur nished, and there
was laid in that bed the statue of a man, exceeding great, and armed at
all points, and he had the one arm stretched out, and a writing in his
hand. And the king went to him, and took it from his hand, and opened it
and read it, and it said thus, Audacious one, thou who shalt read this
writing, mark well what thou art, and how great evil through thee shall
come to pass, for even as Spain was peopled and conquered by me, so by
thee shall it be depopulated and lost. And I say unto thee, that I was
Hercules the strong, he who conquered the greater part of the world, and
all Spain; and having seen this they went to behold another apartment.
He opened the door, and when it was opened they found Hebrew letters
which said, This house is one of the wonders of Hercules; and when they
had read these letters they saw . . . a coffer of silver, and it was
fastened with a lock of

mother-of-pearl. *And the king* said, Within this coffer lies that which
I seek to know, and which Hercules has so strongly forbidden to be
known. And when the lock was broken, a:nd the coffer open, they found
nothing within, except a white cloth folded between two pieces of
copper; and he took it and opened it, and found Moors pourtrayed therein
with turbans, and banners in their hands, and with their swords round
their necks, and their bows behind them at the saddlebow, and over these
figures were letters which said, When this cloth shall be opened, and
these figures seen, men apparelled like them shall conquer Spain and
shall be Lords thereof." EXTRACTS FROM SOUTHEY'S TRANSLATION OF
"CHRONICA DEL REY DON RODRIGO." PART I, CHAPTERS 28-30.
