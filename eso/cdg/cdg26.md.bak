### MOSES AND ELIAS FASTED FORTY DAYS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_P">P</span></span>*Moses*.--"And he
was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat
bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the
covenant, the ten commandments." EXODUS xxxiv, 28.

*Elias*.--"And the angel of the Lord came again the second time, and
touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great
for thee. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God." I
KINGS xix, 7, 8.
