### PANIC TERRORS. ORIGIN OF THE TERM.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_L">L</span></span>"For having
privily taken the measure of Osiris's body, he (Typho) caused a chest to
be made exactly of the same size with it, as beautiful as might be, and
set off with all the ornaments of art. This chest he brought into his
banqueting room; where, after it had been much admired by all who were
present, Typho as it were in jest, promised to give it to anyone of
them, whose body upon trial it might be found to fit. Upon this the
whole company, one after another, got into it, but as it did not fit any
of them, last of all Osiris lays himself down in it, upon which the
conspirators immediately ran together, clapped the cover upon it, and
then fastened it down on the outside with nails, pouring likewise melted
lead over it. After this, they carried it away to the river-side, and
conveyed it to the sea by the Tanaïtic mouth of the Nile; which for this
reason is still held in the utmost abomination by the Egyptians, and
never named by them but with proper marks of detestation. These things,
say they, were thus executed upon the 17th day of the month Athyr, when
the Sun was in Scorpio, in the 28th year of Osiris's reign; though there
are others,

who tell us that he was no more than 28 years old at this time.

The first who knew the accident which had befallen their king, were the
Pans and Satyrs who inhabited the country about Chemmis; and they
immediately acquainting the people with the news gave the first occasion
to the name of *Panic Terrors*, which has ever since been made use of to
signifie any sudden afright or amazement of a multitude."' PLUTARCH,
"Isis AND OSIRIS," §13, 14. TRANSLATED BY SAMUEL SQUIRE, A.M.
