Flame in and about the God-enlightened man. When governed and directed
upward this Flame becomes the instrument which the soul uses to build up
its deathless Solar or Spiritual Body*.

PARENT OF THE SUN! POUR FORTH THY LIGHT GIVING POWER AND ENERGISE THY

*WARNING*.

This book is for the student who seeks to illuminate his intelligence by
the Torch of his own divinity. Let him whose quest is the gratification
of a selfish intellectualism beware its pages, for this is a book of
hidden mystery and power. Therefore let the mind be pure that it may
invite the approach of the Pilgrim Soul and come into a new realisation
of God's Omnipotence and Justice.
