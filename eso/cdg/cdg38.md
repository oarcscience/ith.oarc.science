### CURTIUS RUFUS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_BB">BB</span></span>"Of the birth of
Curtius Rufus, whom some affirm to have been the son of a gladiator, I
would not publish a falsehood, while I shrink from telling the truth. On
reaching manhood he attached himself to a quæstor to whom Africa had
been allotted, and was walking alone at midday in some unfrequented
arcade in the town of Adrumetum, when he saw a female figure of more
than human stature, and heard a voice, 'Thou, Rufus, art the man who
will one day come into this province as proconsul.' Raised high in hope
by such a presage, he returned to Rome, where, through the lavish
expenditure of his friends and his own vigorous ability, he obtained the
quæstorship, and, subsequently, in competition with well-born
candidates, the prætorship, by the vote of the emperor Tiberius, who
threw a veil over the discredit of his origin, saying, 'Curtius Rufus
seems to me to be his own ancestor.' Afterwards, throughout a long old
age of surly sycophancy to those above him, of arrogance to those
beneath him, and of moroseness among his equals, he gained the high
office of the consulship, triumphal distinéions, and, at last, the
province of Africa. There he died, and so fulfilled the presage of his
destiny." "ANNALS OF TACITUS," BOOK XI §2I. CHURCH AND BRODRIBB'S
TRANSLATION.
