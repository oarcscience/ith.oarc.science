The core of this book is an anonymous English translation of a French
'novel of ideas' originally published in 1670. The Abbé de Villars, the
author, was a French clergyman born in 1635 in Alet, near Toulouse in
the south of France. He came to Paris in 1667, where he wrote a number
of books, most of which other than this work which have been forgotten
or lost. He was assassinated in 1673 or (by some accounts) 1675 while on
the road from Lyons to his native Languedoc.

The book describes an encounter with a mysterious Comte de Gabalis, who
is a master of the occult sciences. Gabalis initiates de Villars into
the secrets of the elemental beings: the Sylphs of the Air, the Undines
of the Water, the Gnomes of the Earth and the Salamanders of Fire. The
Abbé is not sure whether the elementals are demons, while Gabalis
encourages him to symbolically (?) marry one of the elementals.

Of course there is a lot more going on here than the dialog would
indicate. There are profuse classical and esoteric references. This
particular edition wraps the translation in a heavy cloak of parallel
commentary, footnotes, endnotes and sub-footnotes. The additional
material will be of much interest by itself, as a miscellany of esoteric
topics including a whole section of prophecies. And even though there
are hints, neither the original text nor the commentary ever discloses
exactly *who* the Comte de Gabalis is...

Production Notes. The first portion of this edition, the 'Discourses'
section, has commentary on facing pages; these were turned into
footnotes instead of trying to reproduce the page layout. For a number
of reasons, it was impossible to run a full spellcheck on this text, so
there are undoubtedly more OCR errors left in this text than usual. As
usual, I welcome any comments about typographical errors.
