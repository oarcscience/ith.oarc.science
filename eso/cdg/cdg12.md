### HARMONY OF THE WORLD.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_B">B</span></span>Throughout the
universe there vibrates a resonant tone known to Occultists as the
Bindery Note. When man, by discipline of the mind, is able to shut off
all sense perception, he becomes conscious of an ever-vibrating rhythmic
throb or pulsation which manifests as a distinct and audible sound. As
the earth and planets . have each their own note or sound vibration,
this pulse of the universe creates a respondent chord from the spheres.
When the different planets approach the earth their respective notes are
apparent to the consciousness of the Adept as distinct tones predominant
in the Harmony of the World.
