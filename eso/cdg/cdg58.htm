<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_UU">UU</A></FONT></span>A Master is an evolved being who has perfected a mental body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> in which he can function consciously while out of his physical vehicle. A Master, through that degree of Divine Force&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> which his rapidly-evolving Solar Body enables him to contact, has power to understand and to apply many of the laws governing the so-called phenomena of Nature.</p>  
<p>Dante Alighieri makes mention of his first meeting with his Master in these words, "for there appeared to be in my room a mist of the colour of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed therewithal to rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking he said many things, among the which I could understand but few; and of these, this: <i>Ego dominus tuus</i> (I am thy Master)." <small>LA VITA NUOVA. TRANSLATED BY DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</small></p>
