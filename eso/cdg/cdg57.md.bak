### HERCULES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_TT">TT</span></span>Throughout the
world's history, the life stories of the supreme Spiritual teachers, or
Saviours of mankind, have been so identical in incident that a
thoughtful comparison of them leads inevitably to the conclusion that to
be *"a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek " is to fill a
definite office and to perform a predetermined work in the transmission
of spiritual force for the liberation of human souls*. For example, the
parallelism between the lives of Hercules and of Christ

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

is so close that orthodox writers admit Hercules to have been a type of
that which the Christ was to accomplish and to endure. And the Rev. Mr.
Faber identifies the Greek with the Christian Theology in the following
passage: "On the sphere he (Hercules) is represented in the act of
contending with the serpent, the head of which is placed under his foot:
and this serpent, we are told, is that which guarded the tree with
golden fruit in the midst of the garden of the Hesperides. But the
garden of the Hesperides, as we have already seen, was no other than the
garden of Paradise: consequently, the serpent of that garden, the head
of which is crushed beneath the heel of Hercules, and which itself is
described as incircling with its folds the trunk of the mysterious tree,
must necessarily be a transcript of that serpent whose form was assumed
by the tempter of our first parents. We may observe the same ancient
tradition in the Phenician fable respecting Ophion or Ophioneus." <span
