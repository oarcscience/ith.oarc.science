<p>The Moslem world acknowledges and reverences the divine mission of Jesus, "And to Jesus, son of Mary, gave we clear proofs <em>of his mission</em>, and strengthened him by the Holy Spirit," (Koran Sura 2,) and holds that he was miraculously born. A statement of this belief is to he found in the Koran Sura 19.</p>
<p>"And make mention in the Book, of Mary, when she went apart from her family, eastward,</p>
<p>And took a veil to shroud herself from them: and we sent our spirit to her, and he took before her the form of a perfect man.</p>
<p>She said: 'I fly for refuge from thee to the God of Mercy I If thou fearest Him, begone from me.'</p>
<p>He said: 'I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a holy son.'</p>
<p>She said: 'How shall I have a son, when man bath never touched me? and I am not unchaste.'</p>
<p>He said: 'So shall it be. Thy Lord path said 'Easy is this with me;' and we will make him a sign to mankind, and a mercy from us. For if is a thing decreed.'</p>
<p>And she conceived him, and retired with him to a far-off place.</p>
<p>__________________</p>
<p>This is Jesus, the son of Mary; this is a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt</p>
<p>It beseemeth not God to beget a son. Glory he to Him! When he decreeth a thing, He only saith to it,</p>
<p>Be, and it IS."</p>
