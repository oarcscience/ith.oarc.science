### GIOVANI FRANCESCO PICO DELLA MIRANDOLA,

### 1463 A.D.--1494. A.D.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_LL">LL</span></span>In the year
1486, this celebrated Italian Philosopher, fell in with an impostor who
showed him sixty Hebrew Codices and persuaded him that they had been
compiled by order of Esdra, and contained the most recondite mysteries
of religion and philosophy. In his "Apologia," the Prince de Mirande
writes, "When I had bought these books at no moderate price, and had
read them with utmost diligence and with indefatigable toil, I saw in
them as God is my witness not so much Mosaic. as Christian religion."
