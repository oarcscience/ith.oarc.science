### MAGICIANS SENT BY GRIMALDUS, DUKE OF BENEVENTUM.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_GGG">GGG</span></span>A few years
ago a certain folly was spread abroad. There had been a great mortality
among cattle; and it was said that Grimaldus, Duke of Beneventum, had
sent men with powders to scatter over fields, mountains, meadows and
springs, for the reason that he was an enemy to the most Christian
Emperor Charles, and that the cattle had died by this same powder. For
this cause many were arrested, as we heard and indeed saw; some were
killed, most fastened to boards, thrown into the river, and so sent to
death. And what is highly astonishing, the persons arrested testified
against themselves, stating that they had had such a powder and had
scattered it. <span class="small">AGOBARDUS, LIBER DE GRANDINE ET
