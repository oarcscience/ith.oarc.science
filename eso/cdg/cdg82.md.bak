### THE MESSENGER.

### PROPHECY OF THE MESSENGER AND OF THE STONE THAT SHALL BE SET UP IN EGYPT.

In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of
Canaan, and swear to the Lord of Hosts; one shall be called "The City of
the Sun."

In that day shall there be an altar <span
id="fr_267"></span>[\*](#fn_266.md) to the Lord in the midst of the land of
Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord.

And it shall be for a Sign and for a Witness unto the Lord of Hosts in
the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the Lord because of the
oppressors, and He shall send them a Saviour, and a great one, and he
shall deliver them.

And the Lord shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the
Lord in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall
vow a vow unto the Lord, and perform it.

And the Lord shall smite Egypt: He shall smite and heal it <span
id="fr_268"></span>[§](#fn_267.md): and they shall return even to the Lord,
and He shall be intreated of them, and shall heal them.

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, <span
id="fr_269"></span>[†](#fn_268.md) and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt,
and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the
Assyrians.

In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even
a blessing in the midst of the land: whom the Lord of Hosts shall bless,
saying, "Blessed be Egypt, my people, and Assyria the work of my hands,
and Israel mine inheritance." <span class="small">ISAIAH, CHAPTER xix,
VERSES 18-25</span>.
