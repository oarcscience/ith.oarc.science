*The Art of Worldly Wisdom*, by Balthasar Gracian, tr. by Joseph Jacobs,
\[1892\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

l *Never lose Self-respect*,

or be too familiar with oneself. Let your

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

own right feeling be the true standard of your rectitude, and owe more
to the strictness of your own self-judgment than to all external
sanctions. Leave off anything unseemly more from regard for your own
self-respect than from fear of external authority. Pay regard to that
and there is no need of Seneca's imaginary tutor.

li *Know how to Choose well*.

Most of life depends thereon. It needs good taste and correct judgment,
for which neither intellect nor study suffices. To be choice, you must
choose, and for this two things are needed: to be able to choose at all,
and then to choose the best. There are many men of fecund and subtle
mind, of keen judgment, of much learning, and of great observation who
yet are at a loss when they come to choose. They always take the worst
as if they had tried to go wrong. Thus this is one of the greatest gifts
from above.

lii *Never be put out*.

’Tis a great aim of prudence never to be embarrassed. It is the sign of
a real man. of a noble heart, for magnanimity is not easily put

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

out. The passions are the humours of the soul, and every excess in them
weakens prudence; if they overflow through the mouth, the reputation
will be in danger. Let a man therefore be so much and so great a master
over himself that neither in the most fortunate nor in the most adverse
circumstances can anything cause his reputation injury by disturbing his
self-possession, but rather enhance it by showing his superiority.

liii *Diligent and Intelligent*.

Diligence promptly executes what intelligence slowly excogitates. Hurry
is the failing of fools; they know not the crucial point and set to work
without preparation. On the other hand, the wise more often fail from
procrastination; foresight begets deliberation, and remiss action often
nullifies prompt judgment. Celerity is the mother of good fortune. He
has done much who leaves nothing over till to-morrow. *Festina lente* is
a royal motto.

liv *Know how to show your Teeth*.

Even hares can pull the mane of a dead lion. There is no joke about
courage. Give way

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

to the first and you must yield to the second, and so on till the last,
and to gain your point at last costs as much trouble as would have
gained much more at first. Moral courage exceeds physical; it should be
like a sword kept ready for use in the scabbard of caution. It Is the
shield of great place; moral cowardice lowers one more than physical.
Many have had eminent qualities, yet, for want of a stout heart, they
passed inanimate lives and found a tomb in their own sloth. Wise Nature
has thoughtfully combined in the bee the sweetness of its honey with the
sharpness of its sting.

lv *Wait*.

It's a sign of a noble heart dowered with patience, never to be in a
hurry, never to be in a passion. First be master over yourself if you
would be master over others. You must pass through the circumference of
time before arriving at the centre of opportunity. A wise reserve
seasons the aims and matures the means. Time's crutch effects more than
the iron club of Hercules. God Himself chasteneth not with a rod but
with time. He <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) spake a great word who
said, "Time and I against any two."

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fortune herself
rewards waiting with the first prize.

lvi *Have Presence of Mind*.

The child of a happy promptitude of spirit. Owing to this vivacity and
wideawakeness there is no fear of danger or mischance. Many reflect much
only to go wrong in the end: others attain their aim without thinking of
it beforehand. There are natures of Antiperistasis who work best in an
emergency. They are like monsters who succeed in all they do offhand,
but fail in aught they think over. A thing occurs to them at once or
never: for them there is no court of appeal. Celerity wins applause
because it proves remarkable capacity; subtlety of judgment, prudence in
action.

lvii *Slow and Sure*.

Early enough if well. Quickly done can be quickly undone. To last an
eternity requires an eternity of preparation. Only excellence counts;
only achievement endures. Profound intelligence is the only foundation
for immortality. Worth much costs much. The precious metals are the
heaviest.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

lviii *Adapt Yourself to your Company*.

There is no need to show your ability before every one. Employ no more
force than is necessary. Let there be no unnecessary expenditure either
of knowledge or of power. The skilful falconer only flies enough birds
to serve for the chase. If there is too much display to-day there will
be nothing to show to-morrow. Always have some novelty wherewith to
dazzle. To show something fresh each day keeps expectation alive and
conceals the limits of capacity.

lix *Finish off well*.

In the house of Fortune, if you enter by the gate of pleasure you must
leave by that of sorrow and *vice versâ*. You ought therefore to think
of the finish, and attach more importance to a graceful exit than to
applause on entrance. ’Tis the common lot of the unlucky to have a very
fortunate outset and a very tragic end. The important point is not the
vulgar applause on entrance—that comes to nearly all—but the general
feeling at exit. Few in life are felt to deserve an encore. Fortune
rarely accompanies any one to the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

door: warmly as she may welcome the coming, she speeds but coldly the
parting guest.

lx *A Sound Judgment*.

Some are born wise, and with this natural advantage enter upon their
studies, with a moiety already mastered. With age and experience their
reason ripens, and thus they attain a sound judgment. They abhor
everything whimsical as leading prudence astray, especially in matters
of state, where certainty is so necessary, owing to the importance of
the affairs involved., Such men deserve to stand by the helm of state
either as pilots or as men at the wheel.

lxi *To Excel in what is Excellent*.

A great rarity among excellences. You cannot have a great man without
something pre-eminent. Mediocrities never win applause. Eminence in some
distinguished post distinguishes one from the vulgar mob and ranks us
with the elect. To be distinguished in a Small post is to be great in
little: the more comfort, the less glory. The highest eminence in great
affairs has the royal characteristic of exciting admiration and winning
goodwill.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

lxii *Use good Instruments*.

Some would have the subtlety of their wits proven by the meanness of
their instruments. ’Tis a dangerous satisfaction, and deserves a fatal
punishment. The excellence of a minister never diminished the greatness
of his lord. All the glory of exploits reverts to the principal actor;
also all the blame. Fame only does business with principals. She does
not say, "This had good, that had bad servants," but, "This was a good
artist, that a bad one." Let your assistants be selected and tested
therefore, for you have to trust to them for an immortality of fame.

lxiii *To he the First of the Kind is an Excellence*,

and to be eminent in it as well, a double one. To have the first move is
a great ad-vantage when the players are equal. Many a man would have
been a veritable Phœnix if he had been the first of the sort. Those who
come first are the heirs of Fame; the others get only a younger
brother's allowance: whatever they do, they cannot persuade the world
they are anything more than parrots. The skill of prodigies may find a
new path to

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

eminence, but prudence accompanies them all the way. By the novelty of
their enterprises sages write their names in the golden book of heroes.
Some prefer to be first in things of minor import than second in greater
exploits.

lxiv *Avoid Worry*.

Such prudence brings its own reward. It escapes much, and is thus the
midwife of comfort and so of happiness. Neither give nor take bad news
unless it can help. Some men's ears are stuffed with the sweets of
flattery; others with the bitters of scandal, while some cannot live
without a daily annoyance no more than Mithridates could without poison.
It is no rule of life to prepare for yourself lifelong trouble in order
to give a temporary enjoyment to another, however near and dear. You
never ought to spoil your own chances to please another who advises and
keeps out of the affair, and in all cases where to oblige another
involves disobliging yourself, ’tis a standing rule that it is better he
should suffer now than you afterwards and in vain.

lxv *Elevated Taste*.

You can train it like the intellect. Full

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

knowledge whets desire and increases enjoyment. You may know a noble
spirit by the elevation of his taste: it must be a great thing that can
satisfy a great mind. Big bites for big mouths, lofty things for lofty
spirits. Before their judgment the bravest tremble, the most perfect
lose confidence. Things of the first importance are few; let
appreciation be rare. Taste can be imparted by intercourse: great good
luck to associate with the highest taste. But do not affect to be
dissatisfied with everything: ’tis the extreme of folly, and more odious
if from affectation than if from Quixotry. Some would have God create
another world and other ideals to satisfy their fantastic imagination.

lxvi *See that Things end well*.

Some regard more the rigour of the game than the winning of it, but to
the world the discredit of the final failure does away with any
recognition of the previous care. The victor need not explain. The world
does not notice the details of the measures employed; but only the good
or ill result. You lose nothing if you gain your end. A good end gilds
everything, however unsatisfactory the means. Thus at times it is part
of the art of

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

life to transgress the rules of the art, if you cannot end well
otherwise.

lxvii *Prefer Callings "en Evidence."*

Most things depend on the satisfaction of others. Esteem is to
excellence what the zephyr is to flowers, the breath of life. There are
some callings which gain universal esteem, while others more important
are without credit. The former, pursued before the eyes of all, obtain
the universal favour; the others, though they are rarer and more
valuable, remain obscure and unperceived, honoured but not applauded.
Among princes conquerors are the most celebrated, and therefore the
kings of Aragon earned such applause as warriors, conquerors, and great
men. An able man will prefer callings *en evidence* which all men know
of and utilise, and he thus becomes immortalised by universal suffrage.

lxviii *It is better to help with Intelligence than with Memory*.

The more as the latter needs only recollection, the former νοῦς. Many
persons omit the *à propos* because it does not occur to them; a
friend's advice on such occasions may enable

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

them to see the advantages. ’Tis one of the greatest gifts of mind to be
able to offer what is needed at the moment: for want of that many things
fail to be performed. Share the light of your intelligence, when you
have any, and ask for it when you have it not, the first cautiously, the
last anxiously. Give no more than a hint: this *finesse* is especially
needful when it touches the interest of him whose attention you awaken.
You should give but a taste at first, and then pass on to more when that
is not sufficient. If he thinks of No, go in search of Yes. Therein lies
the cleverness, for most things are not obtained simply because they are
not attempted.

lxix *Do not give way to every common Impulse*.

He is a great man who never allows himself to be influenced by the
impressions of others. Self-reflection is the school of wisdom. To know
one's disposition and to allow for it, even going to the other extreme
so as to find the *juste milieu* between nature and art. Self-knowledge
is the beginning of self-improvement. There be some whose humours are so
monstrous that they are always under the influence of one or other of
them, and put them in place of their real inclinations. They

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

are torn asunder by such disharmony and get involved in contradictory
obligations. Such excesses not only destroy firmness of will; all power
of judgment gets lost, desire and knowledge pulling in opposite
directions.

lxx *Know how to Refuse*.

One ought not to give way in everything nor to everybody. To know how to
refuse is therefore as important as to know how to consent. This is
especially the case with men of position. All depends on the *how*. Some
men's No is thought more of than the Yes of others: for a gilded No is
more satisfactory than a dry Yes. There are some who always have No on
their lips, whereby they make everything distasteful. No always comes
first with them, and when sometimes they give way after all, it does
them no good on account of the unpleasing herald. Your refusal need not
be point-blank: let the disappointment come by degrees. Nor let the
refusal be final; that would be to destroy dependence; let some spice of
hope remain to soften the rejection. Let politeness compensate and fine
words supply the place of deeds. Yes and No are soon said, but give much
to think over.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

lxxi *Do not Vacillate*.

Let not your actions be abnormal either from disposition or affectation.
An able man is always the same in his best qualities; he gets the credit
of trustworthiness. If he changes, he does so for good reason or good
consideration. In matters of conduct change is hateful. There are some
who are different every day; their intelligence varies, still more their
will, and with this their fortune. Yesterday's white is to-day's black:
to-day's No was yesterday's Yes. They always give the lie to their own
credit and destroy their credit with others.

lxxii *Be Resolute*.

Bad execution of your designs does less harm than irresolution in
forming them. Streams do less harm flowing than when dammed up. There
are some men so infirm of purpose that they always require direction
from others, and this not on account of any perplexity, for they judge
clearly, but from sheer incapacity for action. It needs some skill to
find out difficulties, but more to find a way out of them. There are
others who are never in straits . their clear judgment and determined
character

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

it them for the highest callings: their intelligence tells them where to
insert the thin end of the wedge, their resolution how to drive it home.
They soon get through anything: as soon as they have done with one
sphere of action, they are ready for another. Affianced to Fortune, they
make themselves sure of success.

lxxiii *Utilise Slips*.

That is how smart people get out of difficulties. They extricate
themselves from the most intricate labyrinth by some witty application
of a bright remark. They get out of a serious contention by an airy
nothing or by raising a smile. Most of the great leaders are well
grounded in this art. When you have to refuse, it is often the polite
way to talk of something else. Sometimes it proves the highest
understanding not to understand.

lxxiv *Do not be Unsociable*.

The truest wild beasts live in the most populous places. To be
inaccessible is the fault of those who distrust themselves, whose
honours change their manners. It is no way of earning people's goodwill
by being ill-tempered

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

with them. It is a sight to see one of those unsociable monsters who
make a point of being proudly impertinent. Their dependants who have the
misfortune to be obliged to speak with them, enter as if prepared for a
fight with a tiger armed with patience and with fear. To obtain their
post these persons must have ingratiated themselves with every one, but
having once obtained it they seek to indemnify themselves by disobliging
all. It is a condition of their position that they should be accessible
to all, yet, from pride or spleen, they are so to none. ’Tis a civil way
to punish such men by letting them alone, and depriving them of
opportunities of improvement by granting them no opportunity of
intercourse.

lxxv *Choose an Heroic Ideal*;

but rather to emulate than to imitate. There are exemplars of greatness,
living texts of honour. Let every one have before his mind the chief of
his calling not so much to follow him as to spur himself on. Alexander
wept not on account of Achilles dead and buried, but over himself,
because his fame had not yet spread throughout the world. Nothing
arouses ambition so much in the heart as the trumpet-clang of another's
fame. The same

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

thing that sharpens envy, nourishes a generous spirit.

lxxvi *Do not always be Jesting*.

Wisdom is shown in serious matters, and is more appreciated than mere
wit. He that is always ready for jests is never ready for serious
things. They resemble liars in that men never believe either, always
expecting a lie in one, a joke in the other. One never knows when you
speak with judgment, which is the same as if you had none. A continual
jest soon loses all zest. Many get the repute of being witty, but
thereby lose the credit of being sensible. Jest has its little hour,
seriousness should have all the rest.

lxxvii *Be all Things to all Men*

—a discreet Proteus, learned with the learned, saintly with the sainted.
It is the great art to gain every one's suffrages; their goodwill gains
general agreement. Notice men's moods and adapt yourself to each, genial
or serious as the case may be. Follow their lead, glossing over the
changes as cunningly as possible. This is an indispensable art for
dependent persons. But this *savoir faire* calls for great cleverness.
He only will find no difficulty who has a

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

universal genius in his knowledge and universal ingenuity in his wit.

lxxviii *The Art of undertaking Things*.

Fools rush in through the door; for folly is always bold. The same
simplicity which robs them of all attention to precautions deprives them
of all sense of shame at failure. But prudence enters with more
deliberation. Its forerunners are caution and care; they advance and
discover whether you can also advance without danger. Every rush forward
is freed from danger by caution, while fortune some-times helps in such
cases. Step cautiously where you suspect depth. Sagacity goes cautiously
forward while precaution covers the ground. Nowadays there are
unsuspected depths in human. intercourse, you must therefore cast the
lead at every step.

lxxix *A Genial Disposition*.

If with moderation ’tis an accomplishment, not a defect. A grain of
gaiety seasons all. The greatest men join in the fun at times, and it
makes them liked by all. But they should always on such occasions
preserve their dignity, nor go beyond the bounds of decorum. Others,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

again, get themselves out of difficulty quickest by a joke. For there
are things you must take in fun, though others perhaps mean them in
earnest. You show a sense of placability, which acts as a magnet on all
hearts.

lxxx *Take care to get Information*.

We live by information, not by sight. We exist by faith in others. The
ear is the area-gate of truth but the front-door of lies. The truth is
generally seen, rarely heard; seldom she comes in elemental purity,
especially from afar; there is always some admixture of the moods of
those through whom she has passed. The passions tinge her with their
colours wherever they touch her, sometimes favourably, sometimes the
reverse. She always brings out the disposition, therefore receive her
with caution from him that praises, with more caution from him that
blames. Pay attention to the intention of the speaker; you should know
beforehand on what footing he comes. Let reflection assay falsity and
exaggeration.

lxxxi *Renew your Brilliance*.

’Tis the privilege of the Phœnix. Ability is wont to grow old, and with
it fame. The

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

staleness of custom weakens admiration, and a mediocrity that's new
often eclipses the highest excellence grown old. Try therefore to be
born again in valour, in genius, in fortune, in all. Display startling
novelties, rise afresh like the sun every day. Change too the scene on
which you shine, so that your loss may be felt in the old scenes of your
triumph, while the novelty of your powers wins you applause in the new.

lxxxii *Drain Nothing to the Dregs, neither Good nor Ill*.

A sage once reduced all virtue to the golden mean. Push right to the
extreme and it becomes wrong: press all the juice from an orange and it
becomes bitter. Even in enjoyment never go to extremes. Thought too
subtle is dull. If you milk a cow too much you draw blood, not milk.

lxxxiii *Allow Yourself some venial Fault*.

Some such carelessness is often the greatest recommendation of talent.
For envy exercises ostracism, most envenomed when most polite, It counts
it to perfection as a failing that it has no faults; for being perfect
in all it condemns

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

it in all. It becomes an Argus, all eyes for imperfection: ’tis its only
consolation. Blame is like the lightning; it hits the highest. Let Homer
nod now and then and affect some negligence in valour or in
intellect—not in prudence—so as to disarm malevolence, or at least to
prevent its bursting with its own venom. You thus leave your cloak on
the horns of Envy in order to save your immortal parts.

lxxxiv *Make use of your Enemies*.

You should learn to seize things not by the blade, which cuts, but by
the handle, which saves you from harm: especially is this the rule with
the doings of your enemies. A wise man gets more use from his enemies
than a fool from his friends. Their ill-will often levels mountains of
difficulties which one would otherwise not face. Many have had their
greatness made for them by their enemies. Flattery is more dangerous
than hatred, because it covers the stains which the other causes to be
wiped out. The wise will turn ill-will into a mirror more faithful than
that of kindness. and remove or improve the faults referred to. Caution
thrives well when rivalry and ill-will are next-door neighbours.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

lxxxv *Do not play Manille*.

It is a fault of excellence that being so much in use it is liable to
abuse. Because all covet it, all are vexed by it. It is a great
misfortune to be of use to nobody; scarcely less to be of use to
everybody. People who reach this stage lose by gaining, and at last bore
those who desired them before. These Manilles wear away all kinds of
excellence: losing the earlier esteem of the few, they obtain discredit
among the vulgar. The remedy against this extreme is to moderate your
brilliance. Be extraordinary in your excellence, if you like, but be
ordinary in your display of it. The more light a torch gives, the more
it burns away and the nearer ’tis to going out. Show yourself less and
you will be rewarded by being esteemed more.

lxxxvi *Prevent Scandal*.

Many heads go to make the mob, and in each of them are eyes for malice
to use and a tongue for detraction to wag. If a single ill report
spread, it casts a blemish on your fair fame, and if it clings to you
with a nickname, your reputation is in danger. Generally it is some
salient defect or ridiculous trait that gives rise to the rumours. At
times these are

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

malicious additions of private envy to general distrust. For there are
wicked tongues that ruin a great reputation more easily by a witty sneer
than by a direct accusation. It is easy to get into bad repute, because
it is easy to believe evil of any one: it is not easy to clear yourself.
The wise accordingly avoid these mischances, guarding against vulgar
scandal with sedulous vigilance. It is far easier to prevent than to
rectify.

lxxxvii *Culture and Elegance*.

Man is born a barbarian, and only raises himself above the beast by
culture. Culture therefore makes the man; the more a man, the higher.
Thanks to it, Greece could call the rest of the world barbarians.
Ignorance is very raw; nothing contributes so much to culture as
knowledge. But even knowledge is coarse If without elegance. Not alone
must our intelligence be elegant, but our desires, and above all our
conversation. Some men are naturally elegant in internal and external
qualities, in their thoughts, in their address, in their dress, which is
the rind of the soul, and in their talents, which is its fruit. There
are others, on the other hand, so *gauche* that everything about them,
even their very excellences,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

is tarnished by an intolerable and barbaric want of neatness.

lxxxviii *Let your Behaviour be Fine and Noble*.

A great man ought not to be little in his behaviour. He ought never to
pry too minutely into things, least of all in unpleasant matters. For
though it is important to know all, it is not necessary to know all
about all. One ought to act in such cases with the generosity of a
gentleman, conduct worthy of a gallant man. To overlook forms a large
part of the work of ruling. Most things must be left unnoticed among
relatives and friends, and even among enemies. All superfluity is
annoying, especially in things that annoy. To keep hovering around the
object or your annoyance is a kind of mania. Generally speaking, every
man behaves according to his heart and his understanding.

lxxxix *Know Yourself*

—in talents and capacity, in judgment and inclination. You cannot master
yourself unless you know yourself. There are mirrors for the face but
none for the mind. Let careful thought about yourself serve as a
substitute.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When the outer
image is forgotten, keep the inner one to improve and perfect. Learn the
force of your intellect and capacity for affairs, test the force of your
courage in order to apply it, and keep your foundations secure and your
head clear for everything.

xc *The Secret of Long Life*

Lead a good life. Two things bring life speedily to an end: folly and
immorality. Some lose their life because they have not the intelligence
to keep it, others because they have not the will. Just as virtue is its
own reward, so is vice its own punishment. He who lives a fast life runs
through life in a double sense. A virtuous life never dies. The firmness
of the soul is communicated to the body, and a good life is long not
only in intention but also in extension.

xci *Never set to work at anything if you have any doubts of its
Prudence*.

A suspicion of failure in the mind of the doer is proof positive of it
in that of the onlooker, especially if he is a rival. If in the heat of
action your judgment feels scruples, it will afterwards in cool
reflection condemn it as a piece

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

of folly. Action is dangerous where prudence is in doubt: better leave
such things alone. Wisdom does not trust to probabilities; it always
marches in the mid-day light of reason. How can an enterprise succeed
which the judgment condemns as soon as conceived? And if resolutions
passed *nem. con.* by inner court often turn out unfortunately, what can
we expect of those undertaken by a doubting reason and a vacillating
judgment?

xcii *Transcendant Wisdom*.

I mean in everything. The first and highest rule of all deed and speech,
the more necessary to be followed the higher and more numerous our
posts, is: an ounce of wisdom is worth more than tons of cleverness. It
is the only sure way, though it may not gain so much applause. The
reputation of wisdom is the last triumph of fame. It is enough if you
satisfy the wise, for their judgment is the touchstone of true success.

xciii *Versatility*.

A man of many excellences equals many men. By imparting his own
enjoyment of life to his circle he enriches their life. Variety in

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

excellences is the delight of life. It is a great art to profit by all
that is good, and since Nature has made man in his highest development
an abstract of herself, so let Art create in him a true microcosm by
training his taste and intellect.

xciv *Keep the extent of your Abilities unknown*.

The wise man does not allow his knowledge and abilities to be sounded to
the bottom, if he desires to be honoured by all. He allows you to know
them but not to comprehend them. No one must know the extent of his
abilities, lest he be disappointed. No one ever has an opportunity of
fathoming him entirely. For guesses and doubts about the extent of his
talents arouse more veneration than accurate knowledge of them, be they
ever so great.

xcv *Keep Expectation alive*.

Keep stirring it up. Let much promise more, and great deeds herald
greater. Do not rest your whole fortune on a single cast of the die. It
requires great skill to moderate your forces so as to keep expectation
from being dissipated.

xcvi *The highest Discretion*.

It is the throne of reason, the foundation of

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

prudence: by its means success is gained at little cost. It is a gift
from above, and should be prayed for as the first and best quality. ’Tis
the main piece of the panoply, and so important that its absence makes a
man imperfect, whereas with other qualities it is merely a question of
more or less. All the actions of life depend on its application; all
require its assistance, for everything needs intelligence. Discretion
consists in a natural tendency to the most rational course, combined
with a liking for the surest.

xcvii *Obtain and preserve a Reputation*.

It is the usufruct of fame. It is expensive to obtain a reputation, for
it only attaches to distinguished abilities, which are as rare as
mediocrities are common. Once obtained, it is easily preserved. It
confers many an obligation, but it does more. When it is owing to
elevated powers or lofty spheres of action, it rises to a kind of
veneration and yields a sort of majesty. But it is only a well-founded
reputation that lasts permanently.

xcviii *Write your Intentions in Cypher*.

The passions are the gates of the soul. The most practical knowledge
consists in disguising

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

them. He that plays with cards exposed runs a risk of losing the stakes.
The reserve of caution should combat the curiosity of inquirers: adopt
the policy of the cuttlefish. Do not even let your tastes be known, lest
others utilise them either by running counter to them or by flattering
them.

xcix *Reality and Appearance*.

Things pass for what they seem, not for what they are. Few see inside;
many take to the outside. It is not enough to be right, if right seem
false and ill.
