# *To the Reader*

*No laws for the just, no counsels for the wise. Yet no one ever knew as
much as he had need. One thing you must forgive, another, thank me for.
I have called this manual of worldly wisdom an Oracle, for it is one in
curtness and sententiousness. On the other hand, I offer you in one all
the twelve works of Gracian. Each of these is so highly thought of that
his Prudent Man had scarcely appeared in Spain than it was enjoyed among
the French, in whose language it was translated and at whose court it
was printed. May this be Wisdom's bill of fare at the banquet of her
sages, in which she inscribes the items of the feast of reason to be
found in Gracian's other works*.

*DON VINCENCIO JUAN DE LASTANOSA*.
