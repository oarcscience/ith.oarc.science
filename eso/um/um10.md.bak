### CHAPTER VI

### *Buried Cities of the Amazon*

A SHORT time later, I was working intently one evening, when I heard
Saint Germain's voice distinctly.

"Be ready," he said, "tonight at nine o'clock, and I will come for you."

I was alert in an instant, hurried through my work, bathed, and was
preparing for an early dinner.

"I will bring you the proper nourishment," he explained, so I waited and
entered into the deepest meditation of which I could be aware,
recognizing only—God's Perfect Manifestation.

Promptly at nine o'clock, he appeared in my room—wearing garments of
Glistening Metallic-like Substance that looked, as if made of burnished
steel—but felt like a combination of very soft silk and rubber—extremely
light in weight. I touched the beautiful, wonderful fabric and was so
fascinated that—I stepped forth from my physical body, and was unaware
of it, until I turned and saw it lying in bed. Stepping forward to a
large mirror in the door, I saw—my—garments were exactly like those of
Saint Germain. I wondered at this, and did not understand—why they were
different from the—ones—in

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

which we had gone forth before. He saw that question in my mind and
answered it.

"Try to realize, my son, that in the—Ascended Condition of Life—we
are—always free—to use the Pure, Universal Substance for whatever
purpose we choose, and give it any specific quality—we desire—for the
requirement at hand.

"If we wish to use material that is—imperishable—we impose that quality
upon the Pure, Universal Substance, and It—responds accordingly. If we
wish a form to be manifest only a definite length of time, we give the
Substance, of which it is composed—that quality or command—and the form
manifests accordingly. In the present instance, we are going to
pass—through water—and the Radiation from the material in your garment
so surrounds your finer body—as to insulate you from the natural
qualities and activities—of the water element.

"Try to think upon this Power, which is—within—you. Call into use the
great sea of Universal Substance from which you may draw without limit.
It obeys—without exception—the direction of thought, and records any
quality imposed upon it, through the activity of the—feeling nature in
mankind.

"Universal Substance is—obedient—to your conscious will at—all—times. It
is constantly responding to humanity's thought and feeling—whether they
realize it or not. There is no instant—at which human

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

beings are not giving—This Substance—one quality or another, and it is
only through the—knowledge that the individual has conscious control and
manipulation of a limitless sea of It—that he begins to understand—the
possibilities of his own Creative Powers, and
the—responsibilities—resting upon him in the—use—of his thought and
feeling.

"Mankind—through the centuries has qualified the Universal Substance
with perishability and limitation—and the bodies it uses today are
expressing—those characteristics. The entire human race has storms of
hate, anger, revenge et cetera within its feelings—and the four
elements—which have recorded those qualities—return them to man through
the world of nature—as storms. The people of earth have cataclysms of
thought and feeling—as resentment against each other, against injustice,
against places and things—knowingly and unknowingly sending out the
feeling of—revenge. The great sea of Universal Substance—upon which
these qualities have been recorded—and imposed—expresses them back to
their source—the individual—by means of the four elements—as
cataclysms—in Nature.

"Such activities are but Nature's ways of purifying and shaking
herself—free—from the contamination of—human—discordant thought and
feeling, and returning—to her Pristine Condition—of God's Purity.

"Every moment, each individual is receiving into

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

his—mind and body—the Pure and Perfect Life of God. Each moment, he is
also giving quality of some kind to the Pure Universal Substance of God.
This quality—he alone creates and generates—and he must receive it back
into—his mind and body—for all things in the Universe move in circles,
and thus, return unto their—source.

"The Ascended Masters—have learned the—'Law of the Circle'—'The Law of
the One.' Hence, we impose upon the Pure Universal Substance—only—the
quality we wish to use, for the special work in hand. If we desire a
manifestation to express a certain length of time—we set the time—give
the command—and the Substance of which that special manifestation is
composed—responds accordingly.

"In the case of the records—at the Royal Teton—and certain retreats
throughout the world—it is necessary for our work—that certain things be
made imperishable, in order to be maintained during the centuries. We
decree—that quality—into them, and they record exactly our decree,
for—Nature never lies. She is a Truthful recorder of the qualities
playing upon Her. She obeys us, and also obeys man, but there is a
certain activity within Her—that mankind is either in ignorance of—or
else stubbornly refuses—to acknowledge. For this ignorance and
stubbornness—it pays—and pays—and pays—continually, until the individual
personal self learns and does acknowledge—

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

this—Fundamental Eternal Truth: It is—'The Law of the One'—'The Law of
Love'—'The Law of Harmony'—'The Law of the Circle'—'The Law of
Perfection.'

"When humanity really does learn that 'Fact' and obeys—Its Everlasting
Decree—the discords of earth and the destructive activities of the four
elements—will cease.

"There is a Self-generating and Self-purifying Force within Nature that
rises, and throws off all that disagrees with the—'Law of the One.' This
force or Energy is a Pushing Activity from within out, and is—the One
Power—expanding. If discord is imposed upon Pure Universal Substance,
the electronic energy becomes temporarily damned up within it. When such
accumulated energy reaches a certain pressure—expansion takes
place—shattering the discord and limitation. Thus, 'The Great Life of
the One.'—'The Ever-Expanding Luminous Essence of Creation'—'God in
Action'—overpowers whatever seeks to oppose It, and goes on Its
appointed Way the—Supreme Ruler—of the Universe. The Ascended Masters of
Light—know this—and are 'One' with that knowledge.

"Mankind may know it, and be at 'One' also—if they only will. It is
within the capabilities and possibilities of every individual—for It is
the Innate Eternal Principle—Within—Self-Conscious Life. All

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

human beings are—Self-Conscious Life. This Principle plays no favorites,
and—all—can express Its fulness—if they really so desire.

"Within the—Life—of every human being is the—Power—by which he can
express—all—that the—Ascended Masters express—every moment—if he but
chooses to do so. All Life contains—Will—but only—Self-Conscious Life—is
free to determine—upon its own course of expression. Hence, the
individual has—free choice—to express either in the human, limited body
or the—Super-Human, Divine Body. He is the chooser of his own—field of
expression. He is the Self-determining—Creator. He has willed and chosen
to live as—Self-Conscious Life.

"When one individualizes—within the Absolute, All-Pervading Life he
chooses of his own free will to become an—intensified individual
focus—of Self-Conscious Intelligence. He is the conscious director of
his future activities. Thus, having once made his choice—he is the—only
one—who can fulfill that destiny—which is—not inflexible
circumstance—but a definitely—designed—plan of Perfection. It is—a blue
print—which he elects to express in the realm of form and action. So you
see, my son, a human being may at any time determine to rise out of his
human qualities or limitations—and if he will give—all—of his Life, his
Energy, to that determination he will succeed. Those of us who have
raised the body accomplished

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the—'Ascension'—by giving—all—unto the God-Self Within—and hence, It
expresses through us Its Perfect Qualities—'The Divine Plan of Life.'
Come, let us go."

As we started on our journey, I was conscious of going south and east.
We passed over Salt Lake City, New Orleans, the Gulf of Mexico, The
Bahama Islands, and then came to a silver ribbon which I knew to be a
river. This we followed to its mouth. As we proceeded the God-Voice
Within me said:

"It is the Amazon."

"Now, be conscious," instructed Saint Germain, "that the God in you is
always directing and—Master—of every situation."

Just at that moment, we began to descend, and in an instant touched the
surface of the water. It seemed firm—as solid earth—under our feet, and
I experienced a feeling of surprise at the contact. He explained
further—that we could go under water quite as well as to remain on
top—for the garments we wore—radiated a protective aura—for a
considerable distance around our bodies—and contained the conditions we
needed—which enabled us to explore the subterranean stratas of earth and
things—under water.

"This," he continued, "is due to what the scientific world would call—an
'electrical force-field' around our bodies—but the electronic force with
which

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

these garments are charged—is of a higher, finer electricity than that
known in your-physical world. Some day, even your men of science—will
stumble upon it and realize—it has always existed in the atmosphere—but
they have not known how—to direct and control it—for the service of
mankind.

"It is much more easily directed—by the mind—than by physical apparatus
of any kind, yet it can be drawn and controlled through mechanical
means. That which the outer world knows as—electricity—is but a crude
form of the—Great Spiritual Energy of Life. It exists throughout
Creation. As man raises and keeps his consciousness in contact with his
Inner God-Self, he will become aware of the gigantic possibilities in
the use of this higher power and force. Its service to him
is—Infinite—in the creative work that he can do in all phases of
activity."

We then entered the water, passing through it with—no resistance—at all.
I was slightly startled at the novelty of the experience but remembered
instantly the admonition to be conscious only of the—God Within me—as
the Master—of every condition. Presently, we came near the shore and
passed over many crocodiles—who saw us—but were undisturbed by our
presence. Proceeding inland, we came to what looked like the top of a
monument.

"This is the top of a sixty foot obelisk," explained Saint Germain.
"There is only about ten feet above

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

ground. It marked the highest point in a city of importance that was
buried during the last cataclysm—when Atlantis was submerged. The
obelisk is made of Imperishable metal and covered with hieroglyphics of
that period. Notice, they are—very clear and will remain so—because of
the Indestructibility of the metal. The city was originally built ten
miles from the edge of the river—but at the time it was submerged—the
mouth of the river was widened many miles."

We raised above the earth, and passed forward, following the Amazon to a
point—fifty-six degrees west longitude. There, we took observations, and
then proceeded to a point—seventy degrees west. Saint Germain
explained—here was the locality for further observation and research.
The section he indicated—covered the Amazon between these two points,
and also two of its principle tributaries, the Jurua and Madeira rivers.

"This civilization," said Saint Germain, "was built during the
period—between twelve and fourteen thousand years ago. The portion of
the country we are concerned with is that section reaching from
where—the Madeira River empties into the Amazon—to a point west—where
the Amazon touches Columbia and Peru.

"Thirteen thousand years ago, the Amazon—was held within great dykes of
stone. The entire country

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

around it lay at an altitude of at least five thousand feet, and instead
of the tropical climate it has today, a semi-tropical temperature
existed the year round.

"For a great distance in this locality, the country formed a table land
or plateau. Near the mouth of the Amazon were wide beautiful falls. The
city, in which the obelisk stood, was built between the falls and the
sea coast—about ten miles south of the river. There were great reptiles
and vicious animals to be found in the Orinoco River—to the north." We
came to a place near the Madeira River, and Saint Germain continued:

"This is the site of an ancient city—the capital of the empire and most
important place in the civilization of that period." Here, he raised his
hand, and it became as clearly visible, as any physical city is today.

"Notice," he explained, "how it was built in a series of circles and the
business streets go out from its center, like the spokes from the hub of
a wheel. The outer circles were pleasure drives built every third mile.
There were seven of these making the city forty-six miles in diameter
including the central circle. Thus, the business activities did not
interfere with the beauty and convenience of the drives.

"The inmost circle was four miles in diameter, and within it were placed
the executive buildings of the whole empire. The streets were all
beautifully paved, and constructed eighteen inches to two feet below the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

surrounding buildings and grounds. They were flooded every morning, and
washed thoroughly clean before the activities of the day began.

"Observe, the unusual magnificence of the pleasure drives, and how
gorgeously beautiful were the plants and flowers forming the banks on
both sides. One very predominant feature of their architectural design
was that on the top floor of almost all the buildings, especially
residences, were built adjustable domes. These could be opened or closed
at will—as they were constructed in four sections and arranged so as to
serve—for either sleeping or entertaining purposes. The days were never
uncomfortably warm, and at evening the wonderful cool air from the
mountains came as regularly as day appeared."

We entered the capital, an enormous structure of great beauty. The
interior was finished in cream colored marble veined in green, and the
floor, made of a dark moss green stone resembling jade in its texture,
had been laid—so perfectly—as to seem almost like one piece. There were
large tables in the rotunda—of the same kind of green stone as the
floor—but lighter in shade. These had heavy bronze pedestals placed
about three feet from each end. Here, Saint Germain again held out his
hand—and we were among living people—moving through the buildings and
grounds.

I held my breath astonished—for I saw an entire

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

race of golden haired people—with beautiful pink and white complexions.
The men stood fully six feet two to six feet four inches in height and
the women averaged about five feet ten. Their eyes were a most beautiful
violet blue, very clear and brilliant, expressing great, calm
Intelligence. We passed through a door at our right, and entered the
throne-room of the emperor. It was evidently his audience day—for he was
receiving foreign and local guests.

"This was the emperor, Casimir Poseidon," said Saint Germain, in
explanation. "He was truly God Incarnate. Note the kindly nobility of
his face and—yet the tremendous power within him. He—was and is—an
Ascended Master—Blessed and greatly beloved. For many centuries in myth
and fable his memory was kept alive and the perfection of his kingdom
described in epic poems, but as time passes into eternity the memory of
such great accomplishments fades, and is often forgotten by succeeding
generations."

Casimir Poseidon was every inch a Magnificent Ruler. He was fully six
feet four inches in height, well built and straight as an arrow. When he
stood, he towered above those around him and—the very atmosphere seemed
charged—with Mastery. His golden hair was heavy and hung full to the
shoulders. The royal robe was made of a material that looked like violet
colored silk velvet trimmed in gold and under it he wore a close fitting
garment of soft golden

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

fabric. His crown was a simple band of gold with—an immense diamond—in
the center of the forehead.

"These people," said Saint Germain, "were in direct contact with all
parts of the world through marvelous aerial navigation that had been
brought forth for their use. All light, heat and power were taken
directly—from the atmosphere. Atlantis—during this period—was in a
wonderful state of progress—because she had been governed and—shown the
way to Perfection by various Ascended Masters—appearing from time to
time and—ruling for the spiritual uplift of the people.

"Again and again all the way down the ages, whenever a great
civilization has arisen it has been founded—on Spiritual Principles in
the beginning—and maintained obedience to those Laws of Life—during the
time of its ascendency. However, the moment any government or the people
themselves begin to drift into lax ways, so that injustice and the
unclean use of Life become habits either of officials or the
people—disintegration begins and continues—until they either return—to
the Fundamental Laws of Balance and Purity—or are wiped out by their own
discord, that—the Balance may be re-established—and a new start given.

"Casimir Poseidon was a direct descendant—of the Mighty Ascended Master
Rulers of Atlantis. In fact, the civilization over which he ruled was—a
child

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

of the Atlantean culture and attainment. His capital city was famous
throughout the world—for its magnificence and beauty.

"As the rural districts are shown, watch the method by which objects are
transported—for the power these people used was generated in an
instrument-like box—two feet square and three feet long—attached to the
mechanism of the implement in use. The water supply from the streams was
placed under control and its power also utilized. There was no need for
police or military organization of any kind because of the method—by
which the people were reminded of—'The Law'—and the wonderful sustaining
power that was radiated—enabling them to give obedience unto It."

To the east in the park, stood a magnificent building. We approached it.
Over the entrance were placed the words—"God's Living Temple To Man." We
entered, and found it much larger within than seemed apparent from the
outside. There must have been seating capacity for at least—ten thousand
people.

In the center of this immense temple—stood a pedestal about two feet
square and twenty high—made of a Self-luminous milk-white Substance—that
gave off—a White Light—with a breath of pink in it. Upon it stood—a
crystal globe—two feet in diameter made of some kind
of—Substance—holding a soft Self-luminous White Light—within. It was
very

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

soft, and yet so—Intensely Luminous—that the entire building was
brilliantly lighted.

"That sphere," remarked Saint Germain, "was made of a Precipitated
Material enclosing an Intense Focus of 'Light.' It was drawn—and placed
in the temple at that period, by one of the—Great Cosmic Masters—as a
sustaining and Life-giving activity for the People. It continually sent
forth not only the—'Light'—but an Energy and Power which stabilized
their activities and the empire.

"The sphere of 'Light' was focused by the—Great Being—and the building
erected around it afterward. It was—really—a Precipitated Focus and
Concentrated Activity of the Supreme God 'Presence.' The Great Cosmic
Master—who established It—appeared once a month beside the 'Light' and
proclaimed 'The Law of God'—'The Law of Government'—and The Law of Man.'
Thus, he decreed—the Divine Way of Life—and was the Focus of the Christ
Activity—for the people of that Age."

Here, Saint Germain stretched forth his hand again, and living, talking
pictures of this—Great Being—passed before us. It is absolutely
impossible to describe in words the—Glory—of that "Presence." I can only
say—he was truly the—Son of God—in Perfect Expression. In a moment, I
heard the—Great Cosmic Master—proclaiming—"The Law"—to the people.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

The Record and Majesty of his "Presence" and "Decree" are burned into my
memory for eternity—so clearly do they remain in my consciousness. I
give His Decree to you—just as it still stands before me.

"Beloved Children of the One Mighty God—knowest thou not the Life thou
art using is from the 'One Supreme Presence'—Eternally Pure, Holy, and
Perfect? If thou dost aught to mar the Beauty and Perfection of that—One
Life—thou cuttest thyself off from the Gifts of Thy God. Thy Life is
the—Sacred Jewel—of Thy God's Love—the 'Source' of the Secrets of the
Universe.

"Thy God dost trust thee with—His Own Heart's 'Light.' Cherish It—Adore
It—and let It ever expand unto greater—Light—and greater—Glory. Thy Life
is the—Pearl of Great Price. Thou art the—Keeper of God's wealth. See
thou use It for Him only and—know—thou hast received the 'Light of
Life'—for whose use—thou shalt give an accounting.

"Life is a continuous Circle—the Principle upon which thy city is
builded. If thou dost create—That—which is like unto Thy 'Source'—and
knowest His Love and Peace within thee, if thou dost use Thy Powers of
Creation to bless only—then as thou dost move around thy circle of
existence—thou wilt know the Joy of Life—and unto It shall be added
Greater Joy. If thou createst not like thy 'Source', thine evil shall
return unto thee—with more of its kind.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

"Thou alone dost choose thy destiny—and thou alone—answerest to Thy
God—for the use thou dost make of 'Life'—Thy Being. The Great Law—no one
can escape. Long, have I proclaimed this 'Law of Life.' The Law of
'Thyself—Thou are unto thyself, because thou canst always come unto Thy
God—if thou desirest the Perfection of Life.

"I come not always as now—to hold thy straying feet upon the Pathway of
Truth—nor to remind thee of—Thy Eternal 'Light'—set upon a mountain top
for thy guidance. In a far distant day—I will speak within the Heart of
man, and if thou dost Love Life—thou wilt call unto Me—abiding in many
selves. Let this not confound thee, my children. If thou wouldst know
Me—The Light'—thou wilt have to seek Me—find Me—and having found, abide
within Me always.

"In that day, the 'Father—Mother—Son' will be 'One' in the Heart of man.
The Son is forever the Door—the Way unto God. In thy mind and in thy
heart is 'My Light'—ever reminding thee of 'My Presence'—for in the time
to come, I will be present only in—That Light.'

"Then, will I Be Wisdom in thy Mind to govern the Love in thy heart—that
thou mayest be filled with the Peace of The One Life—God. Thy body is
but the instrument of thy Soul, and into thy Soul must stream—'My
Light'—or thou wilt perish.

"My Light—in thy mind is 'The Way' into the

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Heart of All
Light. Only by My Light in thee—canst thou expand—the Light in every
cell of thy Being—into greater and greater Being. In thy throat is My
Light—which is Thy Power to speak—My Words. Through these—I always
illumine, protect, and perfect my children. Words that do not this
three-fold mission—are not My Words—and can only bring misery—when
spoken.

"Meditate upon My Light in thy mind—in thy heart, and thou shalt See
within all things—know all things—and do all things. Then that which is
not of Me can never confound thee.

"I speak these words now—and they shall be engraved upon the tablets of
earth and the memory of its children. In the far off day of which I
speak—one of God's children shall receive—these my words—and shall give
them forth to bless the world.

"In that time, when thou hast fully received 'My Presence'—and art
letting It always act in thy Life and thy world—thou wilt find the cells
of the body—thou dost then occupy—becoming bright with 'My Light' and
thou wilt realize thou canst continue on into that 'Eternal Body of
Light'—the Seamless Robe of Christ. Then and then only, wilt thou be
free from the wheel of re-birth. Having traveled thy long journey
through human experience, and fulfilled the Law of Cause and Effect—thou
shalt transcend all conditions governed by—Law—and

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

shalt Thyself have become 'The Law'—All Love-'The One.'"

"Such is the Eternal Ascended Body of Christ," said Saint Germain
turning to me, "in which one is able to wield the Scepter of
Dominion—and be Free. My son, even now you can ascend into—'The Light of
the One'—for—The Light—is in your mind—The Light—is in your heart, and
if you will stand in It firmly, you can and will raise your physical
body of limitation into your 'Pure Eternal Body of Light'—forever
youthful and free, transcending time, place, and space.

"Your Glorious Self stands ever waiting for you. Come into—Its Light—and
receive Eternal Peace and rest—in action. It—needs no preparation.
It—has All-Power. Come fully into the embrace of your 'Light-Self' and
that moment—even today—your present body can become Ascended."

As he finished speaking, the pictures ceased. We went a short distance
further on, and stopped at a place where a large flat stone lay on the
ground. As Saint Germain focused his power upon it—the stone raised from
the earth and moved aside—disclosing an opening with steps leading
downward. We descended about forty feet, and came to a sealed door. He
passed his hand quickly over the door, unsealing it, and revealing
certain hieroglyphics. "Center your attention on this writing," he
instructed.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

I did so, and saw the words—"God's Living Temple To Man,"—stand out
clearly on the door before me. There—in front of me—stood the physical
door—we had just seen a short while previously—in the living pictures.

The door opened, and we entered a room under one of the small domes
built at each corner. In this, were a great number of metal boxes about
two feet long, fourteen inches wide and six inches deep. Saint Germain
opened one, and I saw they contained sheets of gold—on which the records
of that civilization had been written with a stylus.

I realized—there must be rooms which had been sealed and preserved—under
each of the four small domes, and that the large central dome had been
built over the "Sphere of Light." We found a secret passage connecting
the four small rooms, passed on to the second of these and saw the
containers filled with—jewels belonging to the temple.

The third room contained golden and jeweled ornaments, the throne chair,
and other chairs of gold. The throne chair was a striking example of the
goldsmith's magnificent workmanship. The back formed into a shell making
a canopy over the head of the ruler, and from its sides, hung golden
drapes made of tiny golden links each forming a figure eight. These were
looped back against the chair making a delicate and extremely graceful
effect.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

In the center of the room, was a table about fourteen feet long and four
feet wide made of—real jade—resting upon a golden bronze pedestal. Near
it—stood fourteen jade chairs—whose feet were tipped with gold, the
seats curved and—the backs beautifully carved. On top of the back of
each chair, as though standing guard—rested a beautiful phoenix made of
gold—the eyes set with yellow diamonds. This design symbolized the
immortality of the Soul, and the—Perfected Divine Being—each individual
becomes, as he rises through the fire of suffering—from the ashes of his
human creation.

The fourth room contained seven different types of power boxes—as I
called them—that received and transmitted the force—drawn from the
Universal, for lighting, heating, and propelling power. The
records—showed these people were in contact with—all parts of the world
through wonderful airships. Following this civilization came one known
as the Pirua—and after that the Incas—both stretching over a period of
thousands of years.

Shortly before the city, just described was buried, it reached the
height of its glory and the Great Cosmic Master, who had drawn the Light
by which it was developed and sustained—appeared for the last time to
that empire. He came to warn of impending disaster, and would have saved
its inhabitants—had they heeded him.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

He foretold the cataclysm that swept the empire into oblivion before
five years had passed and announced, it was his last appearance among
them. Those—who wished to save themselves—were instructed to leave that
part of the country—and were directed where to go with the warning—that
the final activity would be sudden and complete.

As he finished the prophecy—his body faded rapidly from sight—and to the
consternation of the people—the pedestal and the crystal globe holding
the—Eternal Light—disappeared with him. For a time the populace were
disturbed by the forecast of events affecting their empire—but after a
year passed and nothing occurred, the memory of—His Presence—became
dulled, and doubt began to creep in—as to the fulfillment of his decree.

The emperor—and those more advanced in spiritual growth left the
kingdom—and came to a certain place in the western part of the United
States—where they remained in safety until the change had taken place.

The great mass of the people who remained became more and more
skeptical, and after two years one among them more aggressive than the
rest attempted to set himself up as emperor. When the real emperor had
left the kingdom—he sealed both the palace—and the temple—in which the
"Light" had been maintained. The would-be-emperor attempted

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

to force an entrance to the sealed temple and fell—lifeless—at its door.

Near the end of the fifth year at noon on the fateful day—the sun was
darkened—and an awful terror filled the very atmosphere. At sundown,
terrible quakes shook the earth and demolished the buildings into
unbelievable chaos.

The land—which is now South America lost its equilibrium—and rolled to
the east—submerging the entire eastern coast one hundred and sixty feet.
It remained so for several years—and then gradually righted itself to
within sixty feet of the original position—where it remains today.

That activity caused the widening of the Amazon. Previously the river
was eighteen miles wide, deeper than it is today, and navigable from end
to end. It flowed from what is now Lake Titicaca in Peru to the Atlantic
Ocean. In a former time, there had been a canal built from the Pacific
to Lake Titicaca, and this connecting with the Amazon formed an entire
waterway between the two oceans.

The name of the continent at that time was Meru, it having been given
the name of—a Great Cosmic Master—whose principle focus of activity was
at Lake Titicaca. The meaning of the name Amazon, is—"boat
destroyer"—which has come down the centuries from the cataclysmic
period—referred to above.

The rolling of the entire continent of South

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> America explains
many conditions on its western coast—that geologists and men of science
have been unable to explain—from the scientific data they have
discovered—up to the present time.

Thus, do the great cataclysms of Nature draw the cosmic veil over
civilizations of splendid achievement, and only fragments of these come
to light as time passes into eternity. This Truth—may be doubted by the
outer world—but the records, of that civilization—now reposing in the
Royal Teton—will one day be its proof—reveal its existence, and the
accomplishment—of that former age.

As I was shown these tremendous activities, I wondered why a
civilization could be brought forth so wonderful, beautiful, and perfect
in every way, and then go down—through the terrible destructive
activities of a cataclysm. Saint Germain saw the question in my mind and
volunteered the following explanation:

"You see," he said, "when a group of mankind is fortunate enough to come
under the instruction and Radiation of—a Great Master of Light—such as
this Great Cosmic Being is—they are given an opportunity of seeing—what
the Plan of Life is for humanity, and the Perfection they are intended
to bring forth and live in—by their own conscious effort. However,
unfortunately, and it has been so many times down the centuries—the
people will not try to understand

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —Life—but let
themselves drop into a state of lethargy. They do not exert the
necessary effort required to accomplish these things—by the power of
God—within the individual. They begin to lean—on the One giving the
Radiation. The sustaining power is only withdrawn, when the individual
ceases to make conscious effort to understand—Life—and willingly work in
harmonious co-operation with it.

"They rarely realize—most of their blessings are the result of the
sustaining power—from the One giving the Radiation. If a certain group
of souls have been taught the—Way of Mastery—and reminded lifetime after
lifetime of their Divine Birthright—the hour arrives—when no more
assistance is permitted. It is then—the Radiation of the Ascended
Masters is withdrawn—and those souls are compelled to come face to face
with the fact—the sustaining and accomplishing power was not due—to
their own effort.

"These must understand—they can only receive that—for which an effort is
made. In such activity, the experiences passed through—compel them to
make the necessary self-conscious application—and when that is
accomplished—expansion and God-Dominion begin to express.

"There is no failure for anyone—who continues to make self-conscious
effort to express Dominion of the Divine over the human—because failure
only

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

comes—when self-conscious effort ceases. All experience—through which
the individual passes—exists for one purpose only, and that is to make
him—aware of his 'Source.' He—must learn—who he is, recognize himself as
a Creator and—as such—Master of what he creates.

"Everywhere throughout the Universe—whenever the power to create is
given to a Being—the responsibility of creating is always
co-existent—with the power. All creation is by Self-conscious effort,
and if the individual upon whom this—Great Gift of Life—has been
bestowed refuses to take his responsibility—and do his duty, his
experiences in Life will prod him with misery—until he does, for mankind
never was created in a condition of limitation and it can have—no
rest—until the Perfection—with which it was endowed in the beginning—is
Fully expressed. Perfection—Dominion—Harmonious use—and Control of All
Substance and Force is the 'Way of Life,'—the Original Divine Blue Print
for humanity.

"God Within the individual—is—that Perfection and Dominion. It is that
'Presence' within the heart of everyone which is the—Source of Life—the
Giver of every good and perfect thing. When the individual looks to and
recognizes his—Source—as the Outpouring of All Good, he that moment
automatically starts the flow of All Good things unto him and his world
because—his attention—to his 'Source' is the—

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Golden Key—that
opens every good thing unto him.

"The Life in every person is—God—and only by the Self-conscious effort
to understand Life, and express the Fulness of good through himself—can
the discord in the outer experience cease. Life—the Individual—and The
Law—are 'One' and so it is—unto Eternity.

"Come," he continued, "we will go to a buried city near the Jurua
River."

We traveled west, and soon came to a slight elevation. Saint Germain
extended his hand, and again vivified—the Etheric Records of those
people. The place we observed was—the second city of importance in the
empire. The one from which we had just come was—the focus of spiritual
power and activity, while the second, we were now to see, was the seat
of commercial and governmental operations concerned with the physical
welfare of the population. Here, was located the national treasury,
mint, governmental, experimental, and inventive activities.

Not far distant from this city, rose the Mighty Andes, the source of the
immense mineral wealth of the empire. I noticed one thing among these
people that seemed most remarkable. All—were so completely at peace—and
thoroughly contented. They expressed quiet and exquisite rhythm as they
moved about. The pictures came to an end, and we proceeded to the only
rocky spot visible.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Saint Germain touched one of the rocks. It moved aside, and we saw a
flight of twenty metal steps leading down. These we descended and came
to a metal door. We passed through, went down twenty steps more, and
found ourselves before a massive sealed bronze door. He reached to the
right, and unsealed a square opening—in which were metal stops like
those of an organ. He pressed two of these, the great mass slowly
opened, and we stood in an immense room—with everything just as it had
been in that far off time. It had been used as a display room for
inventions et cetera—to which the public had access. All the fixtures
were made of metal—combined with what looked like opalescent glass.

"This," said Saint Germain, "was made by a fusing process combining
certain metals with glass in such a way—as to make the metal—strong as
steel and Imperishable. One man in the present age came very near the
discovery of the same process—for he had all but one element, and
that—would have made it imperishable."

The entire room was lined with the same peculiar metal and three massive
doors led from it. Saint Germain went to a box of stops, pressed three
of them, and all the doors opened at once. We entered the first one and
found a passage long and narrow, more like a vault than a room. It was
lined with containers—filled with discs of gold about the size

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

of a silver dollar, stamped with the head of the emperor and an
inscription that read—"God's Blessing to Man."

Entering the second door, we found similar containers filled with—uncut
jewels of all kinds. In the third room, the containers were flat, and
held—thin sheets of gold—on which were written—the formulas and secret
processes—used in that period

"Among these," said Saint Germain, "are many formulas and
processes—which were not used in that former time. They will be given
into the use of the present age."

He went back to the box of stops and pressed another. A fourth door
opened—which I had not noticed before. This led into an arched tunnel or
passage-way—connecting the treasury with the mint. It must have been at
least a quarter of a mile long—and at the far end we entered—an enormous
room.

It was the main part of the mint, and was filled with a maze of
machinery—of most wonderful construction. Among many things I saw were
machines used for stamping the gold and cutting and polishing the
jewels. They simply fascinated one—so perfect was their operation. Here,
Saint Germain showed me a specimen of malleable glass, clear as crystal.

In this room were great quantities of native gold nuggets—gold-dust—and
gold ingots—weighing eight and ten pounds each. I was speechless—at such
an

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

amazing quantity of wealth in one place—and Saint Germain knowing how I
felt, remarked:

"It is utterly impossible—for such quantities of wealth as you see
before you—to be released unto the mass of mankind—because the
selfishness within the commercial world at the present time—makes it the
height of folly—to let humanity—waste more of Nature's gifts.

"God and Nature bestow their wealth lavishly upon the earth—for the use
and blessing of the Souls who incarnate here but—the selfishness and
lust for power—within the feelings of mankind—make them forget the
'Higher Way of Life,' and cause man's inhumanity to man.

"The few—who rise to control of the mass should have the Intelligence to
know that—what helps the mass—helps the individual most—but if they
refuse to recognize this—'Law'—self-destruction follows—brought about—by
their own selfishness. Selfishness and the feeling of power to control
others—blind the reason—and dull the perception—of the outer mind to its
own dangers—and such individuals—ride headlong to ruin in every
case—ruin spiritually—mentally—morally and physically—extending many
times—into the third and fourth embodiment following.

"Only when mankind rises out of the mire of its own selfishness and
lust—in all its forms—can human beings be entrusted—with all that God
and Nature

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

hold ready—for Right Use; but any individual, as he cleanses himself of
his own selfishness and lust—may have the fullest use of all these
riches, when he will use them harmoniously—and for the blessing of
others. Individuals—can—make themselves ready to be custodians of these
gifts—for in the age that is already ushered in—only those will have
unlimited use of wealth—who have made themselves worthy—to be Trusted
Keepers and Dispensers of this treasure. God and Nature provide these
Gifts for man to use rightly and Right use alone—is the condition on
which they may be received." Saint Germain crossed his hands upon his
chest and continued:

"Mighty God—enter so firmly into the hearts of Thy children—that they
want—Only Thee, then none shall want—for any of Thy Great Gifts."

He sealed everything as we had found it, and we returned to my
body—which I re-entered quickly.

He again gave me the crystal cup filled with Living Substance, and said:

"My beloved son, you will be a very valuable helper and may God always
bless you." With that blessing, he bowed and was gone.
