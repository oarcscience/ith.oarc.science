### CHAPTER V

### *Inca Memories*

THE next ten days passed uneventfully. Through past training, I never
went to sleep without holding my attention upon—the Great God Self
Within and sending a thought of loving gratitude to Saint Germain. On
the evening of the eleventh day while retiring, I heard his voice say
distinctly:

"Come!" I had learned to obey that call and immediately stood outside of
my body, passed quickly through space, and in a few moments came to the
Royal Teton. He stood upon its side awaiting my arrival. This time, he
had called me to come to where he was. I obeyed and saluted him.

"At your service," I said, stepping to his side, and smiling at me he
replied:

"We have work to do. Let us go!"

I was fully aware of the direction in which we traveled—certain we were
going a little west of south. Soon, we saw the lights from a city, and
Saint Germain, directing my attention to them, remarked:

"Los Angeles." After traveling some distance farther on, we passed over
another lighted section and this time to my inquiry, he answered:

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

"Mexico City." We then came to a tropical forest and began to descend.
Presently we stood upon an old ruins.

"These are the ruins of the ancient temple of Mitla in the state of
Oaxaca, Mexico," he explained. "You three came into embodiment to give
assistance, as the Inca civilization reached its apex. With the approval
of the Ascended Masters who were directing your own growth, you chose to
come into the Inca family to give the service needed at that time.

"Here, you were born as the children of an Inca ruler who was a strong
soul of great growth and illumination. In deep love for his people, he
called to the One Supreme God for—'Light'—abundance, and perfection to
bless them and the land.

"The Inca's devotion to his Source was—very great—for he knew and
consciously acknowledged—the power of the—'Great Central Sun.' This True
Understanding was taught to the Incan people and, because they knew to
what the—Great Central Sun—referred, used the Sun as the symbol of
the—Godhead. They had—Real—Inner Understanding, and acknowledged the
Fulness of the power from this—Great Central Sun—which today we call
the—'Christ'—for it is the—Heart—of the Christ Activity in the Universe.

"Because of the Inca ruler's devotion to both his Source and the people,
his deep desire for blessing

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

and Light to guide and help them was granted, and—fourteen—from the
Golden City—over the Sahara Desert—responded to give him assistance.
You, Lotus and your Son were three of that fourteen.

"When you were ten, Lotus twelve, and your Son fourteen, all were placed
under my care and direction—to be prepared and trained—for the work you
did later. At that time, I resided in the Golden City—but after the
preliminary attunement had taken place, I came to the palace daily and
gave the necessary radiation and instruction. This continued for four
years—before it was revealed to your father.

"The Inca ruler was amazed at the wisdom of the children, and constantly
poured out his praise and gratitude to God for thus blessing him. When
you were fourteen, the same—Great Cosmic Master—who had taken us all to
the Golden City at the end of the embodiment in the Sahara
Civilization—appeared to the Inca and told him his petition had been
granted—in a very Real manner.

"It was from this time on for over seventy years, that the Incan
civilization came to its greatest height. I came daily from the time you
were fourteen—instructed and attuned the Inca Ruler as well as you
three. You were referred to as the Inca children from the—'Sun.' His
gratitude, love and co-operation were wonderful indeed, and he was
taught to understand and use the—Great Cosmic Law.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

"Your childhood and youth were wonderful for no cloud came to mar the
beauty of that training. Your son was taught the—Laws of Government and
the—Divine Duties—of a Ruler; Lotus the Inner Work and given the Full
Law and consecration of Priestess in the—'Temple of the Sun.' You were
taught the Cosmic Laws of the priesthood, also secretly, the generalship
of Armies.

"After ten years of special training in Peru—all three of you were sent
north to one of the new colonies of the Incan Empire; for the purpose of
helping the people to expand their activities and stimulate their
progress. You went forth with all the love, honor, and blessing the Inca
ruler knew how to give, and established the Capital of the Colony at
what is now—Mitla—in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico.

"Here, you built a great temple under the direction of—Those in the
Golden City—by whom you had been instructed and helped. Lotus was
called—Mitla—in that life, and it was in honor of her that the city was
named. Here she served as—priestess—for more than—forty years. It was
one of the most magnificent temples of that period, and no expense was
spared, for the secret part of it—built below the surface of the
earth—was to remain, and bear witness to that splendid
civilization—centuries later. You knew this at the time it was built,
and certain definite orders were given and fulfilled concerning it;

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

because the entire construction was directed—by one of the Great
Ascended Masters from the Golden City.

"The outer part was made of massive stones, some of which may still be
seen—today—among the ruins. The interior was lined with marble, onyx,
and jade. The jade came from—a secret source—in the Andes Mountains that
has never been revealed to any one. The coloring of the interior
decorative work was most artistic and beautiful, the main color scheme
being—gold, purple, rose and shell pink.

"The Inner Sanctuary was gold—with designs in purple and white. The
chair—in which the priestess officiated—was also of gold. Here—the
Spiritual Power—was focused and maintained—which radiated out to the
empire and its people. With this explanation as a preliminary, we will
now enter the subterranean temple—in which a room has been
preserved—amidst the ruins—of a once great glory." We went some distance
farther away—when Saint Germain commanded:

"Stand back!"

He focused a—Ray of Mighty Power—on a pile of great rocks before us.
Suddenly—they were thrown in every direction—uncovering a cube of—rose
colored granite. He stepped forward and placed his hand upon it. Slowly
it turned, as if on a pivot, revealing an opening about three feet wide
with well defined steps leading downward. We descended

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

twenty-one steps to a door that—seemed to be made of copper—but Saint
Germain said it was—a combination of metals alloyed—so as to make it
imperishable.

Pressing on a cube of rock to the right of the entrance, the door swung
slowly open and admitted us into a small room. At the farther side was a
great archway—closed by another massive door. This time, he pressed his
foot upon a stone of peculiar design in the floor, and the door moved
back—disclosing a chamber of immense proportions—that seemed very much
in need of cleansing and ventilation. No sooner had the thought entered
my mind—than the place became filled with—a powerful violet
light—followed by a soft white haze—becoming brilliant as the noon day
sun. The cleansing was complete, for everything was fresh, clean, and
filled with the—fragrance of roses.

As we entered the great room, my attention was held by a number—of the
most remarkable portraits—I have ever seen. They were etched on solid
gold—in colors—true to life.

"These," Saint Germain explained, "are also—Indestructible. Five of them
are of the Inca Ruler, Lotus, your son, you and myself—all in the
likeness of the bodies we used at that time. It was only during
the—Incan period—that this particular kind of art has ever been
expressed. Through the devotion of—Lotus to her own God-Flame—at that
time, she attracted

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

a—Great Master from Venus—who taught her. That kind of art was different
from anything known on earth—in any age. The Master from Venus—only
allowed a certain number to be made—because this particular type of art
was centuries ahead of its time, and therefore was not permitted to be
used at that period of the world's development. However, it will come
forth in the present—Golden Age we have now entered.

"My son—Oh, that the people of America could only—understand—what
tremendous possibilities stand before them—waiting, waiting, waiting—for
them to turn away from creeds, cults, dogmas, isms and all else that
binds and limits—by keeping their attention—from the Great God
'Presence'—within their own hearts. Oh, that they might—realize—what
freedom, power, and Light await their service, dependent—only—on their
recognition and use of the—Great Loving 'Presence' Within—breathing
through them each moment—know and feel—the Almighty Control—it has over
all manifestation. Oh, could they only realize that their—bodies—are
the—'Temples of the Most High Living God'—who is—Ruler—of heaven and
earth; that they might know what it means—to love—that Mighty Self, talk
to it, acknowledge it—in all things, and—feel—the Reality of That
'Presence'—with at least as great a certainty as they do other persons
and things. If they could

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

only—feel—the closeness and Reality of the—'Great Presence'—deeply, even
for a moment, nothing could ever again stand between them and the—Same
Mighty Supreme Accomplishment—as Jesus—and other Ascended Masters have
attained.

"O America—Beloved Children of the 'Light'—let—this Great God
'Presence,' its wisdom and power surge through you—now—and see how
quickly God's Kingdom—can and will—manifest upon earth. America is the
Way Shower among the nations—bearing the—'Light'—that heralds the
incoming Golden Age. Regardless of her present conditions—'That Light'
shall burst forth and consume the shadows that seek to disrupt
her—Ideals and Love—for the Great God Self."

We then passed through a door at the right where we found more
imperishable records—this time of the Incan civilization and the
important part it played in that cycle.

"You recalled the process for making these records from the memory of
your life fourteen thousand years ago," remarked Saint Germain. "They
will be transported to the Royal Teton together with the portraits—for
this secret temple has completely fulfilled its usefulness and is—now—to
be dissolved."

Soon Beautiful Glistening Beings appeared and removed the portraits and
records. When they had finished, we returned to the entrance and walked

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

some distance away. Saint Germain—focused—his attention for a few
moments upon the position of the secret temple and—stood very silent. I
felt a sudden stillness—grip and hold me—motionless. There was a great
rumbling—like an earthquake. In a moment—all was over—and the secret
temple, which had been the most magnificent creation of its
day—collapsed into ruins.

I could but gasp at Saint Germain's—stupendous power. Truly—the Great
Ascended Masters are—Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the
ancients that—their activities—have been brought down to us in the guise
of myth and fable. They wield Tremendous God Power at—all—times because
they hold with—unwavering determination—to the Great God—"Presence"—and
hence all power is given unto them—for they are—All—Perfection.

"When Jesus said, 'All these things I have done, ye shall do and even
greater things shall ye do,' he knew whereof he spoke," continued Saint
Germain.

"He came forth to—reveal—the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it—is
possible—for every human being to attain and express—while still here on
earth. He showed the—Dominion of the Ascended Master—and—proved—to
mankind that it—is—possible for everyone to so call forth his—God
Self—that he can consciously control—all—things human.

"The Great Ascended Masters of Love, Light, and

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Perfection—who
have guided the growth of humanity on this planet from the beginning—are
no figment of anyone's imagination. They are
Real—visible—tangible—glorious—living—breathing—Beings—of such Love,
Wisdom, and Power that the human mind—gasps—at the immensity of it. They
work—everywhere—in the universe with complete freedom and limitless
power, to do—naturally—all that the average individual
considers—super-natural.

"They are wielders of such Power and manipulators of such Force as to
stagger the imagination of the person—in the outer world. They are
the—Guardians—of the race and, as in the world of physical education
various grades of teachers are provided—to guide the development of the
individual's growth—from childhood to maturity, and then beyond
preparing him for special work; so do the—Ascended Masters of
Perfection—exist to educate and help the individual that he too may grow
beyond—ordinary, human expression. Thus, he develops his Super-Human
Attributes, until like the student graduating from college—the one under
the care and instruction of an Ascended Master—graduates out of his
humanity—into the—Full—Continuous—Expression—of his Divinity.

"The Ascended Master is an individual—who by self-conscious effort—has
generated enough Love and Power—within himself—to snap the chains of all

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

human limitation, and so he stands—free and worthy—to be trusted with
the use of forces—beyond—those of human experience. He; feels
himself—'One'—with Omnipresent God—'Life.' Hence, all forces and things
obey his command because he is a Self-Conscious Being of free will
controlling all—by the manipulation of the 'Light' within—Himself.

"It is through the radiation or outpouring of this 'Light'—which is
really his own—'Luminous Essence of Divine Love'—that an Ascended Master
is able—to help—those who come under his care and direction.

"When such an—Outpouring—to a student takes place, his own Inner
bodies—and by that I mean his emotional, mental, and Causal
bodies—absorb the—Master's Luminous Essence—and the 'Light' within them
glows and expands like a spark—which one fans into a—flame.

"This 'Luminous Essence' has within It the Highest Force in the
Universe—for it dissolves all discord—and establishes—Perfect Balance—in
all manifestation. The Ascended Master's—Body—is constantly pouring out
Rays of his 'Light Essence'—upon the discords of earth—dissolving them
as—the rays of force—which we call light and heat from our physical
sun—dissolve a fog.

"The Radiation—they pour out to humanity of earth is—Consciously Drawn
Energy to which they

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

give—quality—and again send it out to accomplish a—definite result. In
this way, they give protection thousands and thousands of times to
persons, places, conditions, and things of which mankind is totally
oblivious, going on its appointed way—serenely unconscious—of its
Protectors and Benefactors.

"In this kind of activity—the Ascended Masters—are able to change the
bodies they function in—like one ordinarily changes his clothes—for the
cellular structure is always under conscious control, and—every atom—is
obedient to their slightest direction. They are free to use one or more
bodies, if the work they desire to do requires it, for their—ability—to
assemble or dissolve an atomic body—is absolutely—Unlimited. They are
All-Powerful Manifestors—of All Substance and Energy for the forces in
Nature—which mean the four elements—are their willing and obedient
servants.

"These Glorious Beings—who guard and help the evolving human race, are
called the Ascended Masters of Love, Light, and Perfection. They are all
the word—Master—implies because—by bringing forth the Love, Wisdom, and
Power of the God Self Within—they manifest their—Mastery—over all that
is human. Hence, they have—'Ascended'—into the next expression above the
human—which is the Super-human—Divinity—Pure and Eternally, All-Powerful
'Perfection.'

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

"The humanity of earth frequently, in its ignorance and limitation,
presumes to pass judgment upon and express various opinions about Jesus
and many others of the Ascended Host. That practice is one of the most
binding things it can indulge in, for in such activity—the criticism and
judgment sent forth in this way simply return—to its generator—and thus
mankind is bound more tightly to its self-created suffering and
limitation. The activity of the Law is that—the Ascended Masters—having
freed themselves from human limitations—have become a—Blazing Outpouring
of Light—into which—no human thought of discord can possibly enter. This
compels all destructive—thought creation and feeling—to return to its
sender and—bind him—still more closely in the chains of his own
creation.

"If human beings could see their own thoughts, feelings, and words go
out into the atmosphere—upon the ethers—gather and gather more of their
kind and return—they would not only be amazed at what they give birth
to—but would scream for deliverance—and if for no other reason than to
blot such creation out of mind—they would with full determination—face
their own Divinity—and enter into it. Thoughts and
feelings—are—living—pulsating—things. The individual who—knows that—will
use his wisdom—and control himself—accordingly.

"Jesus is to mankind gaining its experience on this

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

earth—as the Great God Self—within every human being—is to the personal
or outer self. He—revealed the—Master Record—to the outer world,
and—He—is still the—Living Proof—of the individual's ability to free
himself from—all—limitation and to express Divinity—as was originally
intended—for the first condition in which humanity existed was—wholly
harmonious and free.

"When some of those individuals—who study Life and the Laws of the
Universe, more deeply than the mass of earth's children—become aware of
the fact that there are Ascended Masters—they often desire to go to
these Great Ones for instruction. While, in many instances, this is an
unconscious upreaching of the soul within to the—Greater Light—yet the
personal self little realizes in what relation it stands to those—Great
Beings—who are Wholly Divine.

"There is a way by which an intensely earnest and determined student may
make contact with one of them but that can only be through the activity
of enough Love and discipline of the personality. If the motive for such
contact be for the gratification of curiosity thinking to prove or
disprove the Ascended Masters' existence—to merely solve a problem—or to
convince a doubt in the personality—it will never come about—rest
assured of that—for the Ascended Host are never concerned with
satisfying the—human side—of any student. Their entire effort is with
the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —expansion of the
God Self Within—so that Its Power may be released forcefully enough—to
snap the limitations in the human self that do not give it a Perfect
Vehicle for use in the mental, emotional, and physical worlds of
manifestation. These are the realms of thought, feeling, and action.

"Human weaknesses and limitation simply impair the vehicle—that should
be trained and kept in the best possible condition—as an efficient
servant—for the use of the Great Inner God Self. The human body with its
faculties—is—God's Temple of Energy—which the 'Great God Presence'
provides—and through this outer self—It wishes to express a Perfect
Divine Plan or Design. If the uncontrolled sense appetites—and demands
of the personality—waste the God energy—so the 'Inner Presence' is not
given command of the vehicle—It steadily withdraws—the human self loses
the power to manipulate mind and body—and the temple collapses into
decrepitude and dissolution. We then have the condition the world calls
death.

"The person—who seeks to contact an Arisen Master—in the visible,
tangible, living, breathing body without the preparation needed—to
gradually attune his own outer structure and mind—is in the same
position a child in kindergarten would be—were he to see a college
professor and insist on learning the A. B. C's under him.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

"The Ascended Masters are—Really—Great Batteries of Tremendous Power and
Energy and whatever touches their—Radiance—becomes highly charged with
their—'Light Essence'—through the same activity—that makes a needle—kept
in contact with a magnet—take on its qualities—and become a magnet also.
All their help and Radiation is forever a free gift of Love. This is the
reason they—never—use any of their force to compel.

"The Law of Love—the Law of the Universe—and the Law of the
individual—does not permit the Ascended Master to interfere—with the
free will of the individual—except at those periods of Cosmic
Activity—in which the Cosmic Cycle supersedes that of the—individual. It
is during these times—the Ascended Master may give—more—than ordinary
assistance. The earth has entered such a Cycle now, and the greatest
Outpouring of the—'Light'—the earth has ever known is being and will
continue to be shed upon humanity—to purify it and re-establish the
Order and Love that is—imperative—for the future maintenance of our
planet and the system of worlds to which we belong. All that does not—or
will not—come into the action of Order—Balance—Peace—must of necessity
pass into some other school-room of the universe—and work out its own
understanding of this Law—in some other way—than is to be the expression
of the future Life upon our earth.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

"There is only one passport into the 'Presence,' of these—Great Ones—and
that is—Enough Love—poured out to one's own—God Self—and to—Them—united
with the determination to root out of the human all discord and
selfishness. When an individual becomes determined—enough—to serve only
the Constructive Plan of Life, he disciplines—perfectly—his human
nature, no matter how unpleasant the task. Then he will automatically
draw to himself the attention of an—Ascended Master—who will take note
of his struggles and pour out courage, strength, and Love—sustaining
him—until he maintains—permanent contact—with the Inner God Self.

"The Ascended Master knows and sees all concerning the student—for he
reads clearly the record—which the student has made in his own aura.
This reveals the state of the disciple's development—his strength as
well as his weakness. The Ascended Master—is—the All-Knowing Mind and
the All-Seeing Eye of God—for from him—nothing—can be hidden. The one
who wishes to come into the visible, tangible—'Presence'—of the Ascended
Host—should understand that unless he makes himself a Radiating Sun of
Love, Light, and Perfection—which the Master can expand, and use as a
part of Himself—that he can direct to any place consciously at will—he
would be useless—merely a barnacle and drain upon the Master's work and
world.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

"If the student has not, be not willing to, or does not discipline the
personal self—so it is calm in mind—peaceful and loving in feeling—and
strong in body—he is not material that the Ascended Master can use in
the—more-than-human work that he does. When the student has not a
strong, controlled, well developed vehicle—he is unable to co-operate
with an Ascended Master, and thus do—work—of a kind which is beyond
that—of the ordinary human experience.

"Were one of these—Perfected Beings—to take a student without such
qualities into his field of work—he would be making the same mistake one
does in building a machine or home, if he constructs it of imperfect
material.

"That kind of material—naturally could not stand unusual strain, under
sudden need, or prolonged service. Thus, it would not be the part of
either wisdom, love, nor mercy to subject anyone to an experience for
which he has—neither the training—nor is strong enough to bear. As the
Ascended Masters are the Acme of Perfection—they naturally would not do
anything except that which is just, loving and wise.

"The attitude of one who wishes to work in conscious co-operation with
the Ascended Host should not be—'I wish I could go to them for
instruction'—but rather—'I will so purify, discipline, and perfect

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

myself, become such expression of Divine Love, wisdom, and power that I
can assist in their work—then I will automatically be drawn unto them. I
will love so constantly, so infinitely, so divinely, that the very
intensity of my own—"Light"—will open the way for them to accept me.'

"My son, self-correction and control of the forces within the use of
human consciousness—is not the work of a moment—nor a path of ease,
lethargy, and self-gratification—for the senses riot within the average
human being—and he rebels furiously against the restraint of his—lower
nature—which is imperative—if he is to govern these forces properly
within himself—especially in his feelings—so they may be used and
act—only—under the conscious Dominion of his God-Mind.

"The saying that—'Many are called but few are chosen,'—is very true. All
are constantly being called but—few—are awake enough—to realize—the
Ecstatic Joy and Perfection within—the God-Self—and to hear Its Voice in
the 'Light' forever and forever calling everyone back into the Father's
House.

"Every individual on earth is free each moment to 'Arise and go unto the
Father'—his God Self—if he will but turn his back upon the creation of
the human senses and—hold his attention—on the—Only Source—in the
Universe from which peace, happiness, abundance, and—Perfection—can
come.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

"There is a way for all to come into contact with the Ascended Masters,
and that is to—think—upon them—call unto them—and they will answer every
call with their own 'Presence' of Love—but the motive for the call must
be—Love of the One Source—Love of the Light—Love of Perfection.

"If this be real, determined, and steadfast, the student—will—receive
greater and greater—Light—for the 'Light' knows Its own and gives of
Itself, unceasingly, unconditionally, every moment. Ask and ye shall
receive—knock and it shall be opened unto you—seek and ye shall
find—call unto the 'Light' and the—Ascended Masters will answer you—for
they are the 'Light' of this world.

"Lotus served as a priestess in the temple of Mitla—for more than forty
years with you and your son. By the combined efforts of you three, the
various cities in the colonies were brought to a state of great
perfection. You established industries and directed the agriculture,
until prosperity abounded in the land.

"It was revealed to the Inca Ruler, when he was to finish his earthly
pilgrimage and service in that civilization. It was then—he called the
three of you home to him. Others were appointed to take your places and
with blessings and love to your people, you bade them farewell.

"On your arrival home, the King was much surprised

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

to find—none of you had aged during the long absence. Your youthful
appearance was the result of training received in childhood, and still
greater proof that his children had been divinely sent in answer to his
prayer. Deep gratitude, to the One Mighty God for blessing him, his
children, and the people, always filled his heart."

At this point, as Saint Germain described the Incan embodiments—living
pictures began to appear in the atmosphere before me—all in
their—original—color and activity. They lasted for nearly three hours,
and. he revealed those ancient experiences as a—Living Reality in Peru
and Mitla.

The Inca Ruler—called the fourteen from the Golden City together—in
preparation for the—most important event—of his earthly pilgrimage. He
knew the hour of passing was near, and the affairs of the empire had to
be transferred into the control of the elder son—whom he was to appoint
his successor at the banquet.

The palace—was famous for centuries, as the most magnificent building of
the period—because the King had tremendous resources at his command
throughout the entire reign. He lived close to his God Self at all
times—and wealth untold flowed into his use. The interior of the palace
was most ornate, the private rooms of the royal family being decorated
in—pure gold set with jewels—and the symbol of the

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sun—used wherever
possible, as a constant reminder of the God Self Within.

The banquet hall was set with five tables of—carved jade—resting on
white onyx pedestals, each seating twenty people, with the exception of
the royal table at which were sixteen—these being the fourteen from the
Golden City, the King, and—the Master Saint Germain—who was then known
as "Son Uriel." The chairs at the King's table were made of gold,
slightly canopied with gorgeous ostrich plumes in magnificent colors. In
the Inca's chair, the plumes were a beautiful violet; in Saint Germain's
an intense gold; the daughter's pink; the eldest son's violet; but of a
lighter shade than the ruler's—and those in the chair of the younger
son—white—representing the authority—of the priesthood. The plumes in
the chairs of the rest of the fourteen from the Golden City were
of—varying colors—beautiful beyond description, the color in each
case—representing the office and service—that each occupant gave—to the
empire.

Cloths of a very soft material, heavily embroidered with thread of
remarkable brilliancy, covered the tops of the tables. The entire palace
was lighted by—self-luminous, crystal globes—that Saint Germain gave to
the Incan ruler, when his instruction first began.

The King wore a royal robe of golden, metallic-like

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

fabric with a marvelous jeweled breastplate representing the—"Sun." Over
this was his robe of office, made of rich, purple fabric trimmed with
magnificent ostrich plumes around the entire edge, and deep collar. His
crown was a band of diamonds, that held three violet plumes at the back.
These three plumes in the Inner Life of the ruler symbolized the three
activities of the Godhead—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—acting through man
as Love, Wisdom, and Power. The two sons were clothed in garments
similar to their father's, except for the long robe of state, each
wearing the symbol of the—"Great Sun"—formed by a breastplate of jewels.
The crown of the elder son was set with emeralds and the plumes at the
back were violet like the king's, but of a lighter shade. The head-dress
of the other son was set with pearls, and his plumes were white—another
symbol of his office—as priest.

The king's daughter was robed in a golden fabric—fine as gossamer
silk—with an over-drape of opalescent material, dazzling to behold—that
changed color with every movement of the body. She wore a jeweled girdle
of diamonds and emeralds with its panel reaching nearly to the floor. On
her head was a close-fitting cap of woven material, and around the neck
a chain—on which hung the symbol of the "Great Sun" set in diamonds,
rubies, and emeralds. Her sandals were of gold—also jeweled.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Just as the King left his private chambers on the way to the banquet
hall, a—Blazing Light—flashed through the rooms, and Saint Germain stood
before us—looking like a God. The "Light" about him was almost blinding
in its Brilliance and we were a few seconds becoming accustomed to it.

His beautiful golden hair hung to the shoulders, and was held in place
by a band of—blue diamonds—around the forehead. His own Intense Radiance
shone through the color of the hair—until it looked like sunlight. The
piercing, sparkling violet of his eyes contrasted strongly against his
skin—that revealed the soft pink color of youth and perfect health. His
features were very regular—like those of the ancient Greeks.

He wore a robe of—marvelous—dazzling white fabric—entirely different
from anything—in our modern world. It fitted the body slightly at the
waist around which was clasped a—girdle of yellow diamonds and
sapphires—with a panel reaching to his knees. On the third finger of his
left hand was a ring set with a—gorgeous yellow diamond—and on the
middle finger of his right a—sapphire almost as brilliant—both blazing
tremendously because of his own great Radiation—as he had just come from
the—Golden City.

The King was surprised and overjoyed at his appearance—and making the
sign of the heart, the head,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

and the hand—bowed low before him and offered the Master his arm. They
proceeded thus into the banquet hall.

Here, the tables had been laid with an entire service of gold, crystal,
and jade. The children of the king soon entered and, when they beheld
their beloved Master, were almost overcome with joy. However, they did
not forget the dignity of the occasion and, making the Divine Sign he
had taught them—bowed low before their father and Distinguished Guest.

The signal was given and all were seated. The King sat at the head of
the table, the Master, Saint Germain, at his right and next to him his
daughter. The elder son was placed at his left and the younger son next,
then the rest from the Golden City.

At the close of the banquet, the Ruler arose and all gave complete
attention. He stood silent a moment, and extending his hand to the
beloved Saint Germain—introduced him to the guests. The Master bowed
graciously, and the King told them how the Higher Spiritual Law had been
taught to him and his children, and how the great blessings which had
come to the land and its people, were the result of the Master's Great
Love. He explained further that the banquet had been given for him to
appoint his—successor to the throne.

He signaled to the elder son to rise and announced him—as their future
ruler. Removing the Royal

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Robe—he placed it
upon the son's shoulders and Saint Germain raising his hands above him
in blessing, said:

"I bless you my son, in the Name and Power of the One Mighty God—in man
and governing the Universe—whose Supreme Wisdom shall direct you—whose
'Light' shall Illumine you—whose Love shall bless and enfold you—the
land—and its people."

Touching the thumb of his right hand to the forehead of the son, the
Beloved Master raised his left hand and a Blinding Flash of "Light"
enfolded them.

The king then appointed those who were to take the place of his daughter
and two sons in the temple at Mitla. Saint Germain, the king, his
children, and the rest of those from the Golden City, proceeded into the
throne room, where the Master turned and again addressed them saying:

"Beloved ones of Light, your brother, the King, will soon pass to his
well deserved rest and higher instruction. Until that time—I will remain
with you. Your civilization will reach its apex under the rulership of
this our beloved brother, and you will need much added wealth to
accomplish all that is to be done. In the heart of the mountains not far
distant, is great treasure of gold and precious stones.

"The younger son of your ruler has not so far recalled a faculty—he used
formerly. I will quicken it into action again, that the requirement of
your future

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

activities be supplied." He stepped toward the younger son and touched
his forehead with the thumb of his right hand. A tremor passed over the
body and his—Inner Sight—became opened.

He saw—in the mountain fastness a certain location—which held such vast
wealth—he knew they would need no other supply for whatever might be
required to produce the things—they were to use in the outer activities.
The son made obeisance to his Beloved Master and promised that—with his
assistance—the plan for its use would be fulfilled. Three of the mines
which he opened and operated were closed and sealed—when the reign of
those from the Golden City was finished. They have remained closed—to
this day.

Archaeologists—in various ways from time to time—are finding evidence
and proof—of the tremendous height to which this civilization reached
and the—splendor of its attainment. The fragments of the Incan
activities—they have discovered so far—are of the civilization during
its decline—but the day will come, when that which was expressed at
its—apex—will be revealed to the blessing, enlightenment, and service of
posterity.

The following day, messengers were sent to the principal points in the
empire, announcing the ascension to the throne of the King's son. His
reputation had preceded him from the City of Mitla, for his

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

wisdom, nobility of character, and justice were known throughout the
kingdom during the years he served there.

A few days later, the younger son directed the head mining engineer to
prepare equipment, men, and supplies for going into the mountains and
opening the mine he had been shown through the use of his—Inner Sight.

When they were ready to start, the son remained alone and held his
attention fixed steadily on the God Self Within, knowing that he would
be directed unerringly in finding the mine, and because of this—had no
difficulty or delay in going directly to the location shown him in the
vision. He put a large number of men to work, and in sixty days had
opened the mine to the point where they made contact with the—richest
gold vein that has ever been located in South America—before or since
that time. The discovery and operation of that mine—has come down to the
present day—in legend among the people. The younger son returned from
his achievement amidst the warm welcome of the people, and received the
blessings of his father, Saint Germain, his older brother and sister.

The location of the mine was at an altitude of eight thousand feet, and
during the time the king's son was there he became highly sensitized—an
activity that—always occurs—at high elevations. Upon his

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

return to the palace, he felt clearly—the time had arrived—for the Inca
Ruler to make the great change, and knew his passing was near.

The day arrived for the coronation of the King's son, when he was to
legally and publicly assume the responsibility and duties of the realm.
The royal family asked their Beloved Master and Friend to perform the
act of crowning the new ruler—to which he graciously agreed.

Elaborate preparation for the important event had been completed, and
the ceremony had progressed to the moment—when the crown—was to be
placed upon the head of the new ruler. All noticed—that Saint Germain
made no effort—to receive it.

Suddenly—there came a Blinding Flash of—"Light"—and before them stood
a—Most Wonderful Being. She seemed to be a girl of only eighteen—but
from her eyes and "Presence" shone forth a Dazzling Radiance, filled
with the Love, Wisdom, and Power of a Goddess. The—Light—that filled the
atmosphere around her, was crystal-white—sparkling within Itself—and
scintillating—constantly.

Extending her dainty hands to the crown bearer—she lifted the crown—and
with infinite grace—placed it upon the head of the King's son, and in a
voice—that was the very soul of music said:

"Beloved of the Golden City—I crown you with Love, Light, and Wisdom of
which—this crown—is

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the symbol. May your justice, honor, and nobility ever continue. By
a—Divine Order—I shall reign with you invisible to all—but those of the
Golden City—who are here."

The new ruler knelt to receive the crown and the—Wondrous Being—stooped
and kissed his forehead. She then turned to the assembled guests,
extended her hands, and blessed them. Immediately—a soft rose
colored—Light—filled the entire place—It being the Outpouring of Her
Love to them. She blessed the former king and turning to his daughter
held her in a fond embrace. To the younger son she extended her hand—and
he kneeling—kissed it with deep reverence.

The new king ascended the throne and bowed to his guests. Offering his
arm to the Beautiful Being, he led the way to the banquet hall and here
they celebrated the coronation by a feast. He gave the signal to be
seated and then addressed them.

"My greatly beloved people," he said, "I know there is but One Mighty
'Presence'—God—in mankind and the Universe, governing all. It is my
desire, as it ever has been, to so live that my mind and body are clear
channels and perfect expressions of the—One Great Indwelling 'Presence.'
May you my friends, my people, our land, and its activity be always
blessed with God's greatest love, peace, health, and happiness. May this
empire—which is God's domain—

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

and of which we are but the custodians, continue in abundant prosperity.
The Love of God in me shall always enfold you, and I ask God's
Eternal—'Light'—to raise you into His Divine Perfection."

As the banquet progressed, the Former King grew very pale. The new ruler
signaled his brother who stepped to his father's side, and assisted him
to the private rooms of the royal family. The King lay down and remained
motionless nearly four hours. His children, the Master Saint Germain,
and the Beautiful Being remained at his side.

When the final moment of his earth span arrived, the Beautiful Being
stepped forward to the head of the couch on which he lay, and addressed
him, saying:

"Brother Inca—thou hast thought to leave thy form to the action of the
four elements—but I say to thee—it shall be Raised—Transmuted—and
Illumined—into that Eternal 'Temple of God' that expresses All
Perfection. Thy great service has freed thee from the wheel of birth and
death. Be thou—now—received by the Ascended Host of Light—with whom thou
art forever—One."

Slowly—the body began to fade from sight—dissolving into a fine mist—and
then completely disappeared. Saint Germain turned to those who stood by.

"My work here is finished," he said, and stepping forward, placed a
ring—of most unusual design

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

upon the third finger of the king's right hand. Its jewel was
a—miniature self-luminous globe—of some kind of precipitated
substance—that looked like pearl, and directly within the center was
a—tiny blue Flame. It was a focus of "Light"—the same as the globes
Saint Germain had given the king's father—with which the palace was
lighted.

"Accept this," he continued, "from the—Master of the Golden City. It is
his request—that you wear it upon your person—always." Bidding them
farewell and bowing graciously, he disappeared from sight.

The Inca's three children had perfect physical bodies, due—to the
instruction they had received in childhood—from the Master Saint
Germain, when he came daily from the Golden City to prepare them for
their life service to the people. All had most beautiful golden hair and
violet blue eyes. The two sons were fully six feet three inches in
height and the daughter about five feet seven. There was a great natural
dignity of bearing—suggesting the Inner Dominion, which they had gained
under his instruction. When the elder son ascended the throne, he was
sixty-eight years old, yet looked not more than twenty-five. Even at the
time they left the earth—none looked more than that age. The new king
reigned forty-seven years, living to the age of one hundred fifteen. The
daughter lived to be one hundred thirteen and the younger son one
hundred eleven.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

The Incan people of that period were all dark eyed and dark haired—with
skins like the American Indian. Those, who incarnated as the mass of the
Incan people, were not souls of previous advanced knowledge, as was the
case in some of the former civilizations such as Egypt, Atlantis, and
the Sahara Desert. For this reason—the Great Host of Ascended
Masters—who direct the evolution of humanity on this earth, placed the
Incan ruler, his children, and the rest of the fourteen from the Golden
City in charge of the government and its people—to establish the
pattern—upon which the later activities were to be molded. They designed
a form of government and a plan of development which—if adhered to—would
have enabled the entire civilization to reach a great height of outer
accomplishment—and at the same time—receive tremendous Inner
Illumination.

As the time drew near to select a ruler from among the Incas themselves,
to succeed the king and his assistants, great care was taken to choose
those whose—Inner Growth was most advanced. Fourteen were found to take
the places of those from the Golden City. The Beautiful Being had made
herself visible to the king—every day—for forty-seven years, giving
advice, and assistance through Her Radiation that wisdom and strength
might be the directing power of the people.

The successors to the king and the fourteen from

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the Golden City were called into the presence of the much loved and wise
ruler, and-the Beautiful Being—who had been invisible—made herself
visible to all. The "Light" about her grew very bright—and she addressed
them saying:

"For over ninety years—the Great Ascended Masters of Light—have taught,
enlightened, blessed, and prospered the people and this empire. The
example is before you. If you follow it, all will continue to prosper
and bless your land. If you do not keep the Love for the One Supreme God
Self—first—in your hearts and acknowledge him—always—as the Ruler of the
empire and its inhabitants, decay will set in, and the glorious
perfection, enjoyed for over a century, will be forgotten. I commend you
to the care of the Great Supreme 'Presence' in all. May he ever protect,
direct, and enlighten you."

Here—a visible proof of the existence of the—Inner God-Self—of each
human being was revealed—to those who were to guide the destiny of the
empire—during the succeeding years. This same example—will again be
given—to the present people of America.

Then—in the presence of the new ruler and his associates—the king and
the fourteen from the Golden City—stepped out of their bodies—and
revealed—the Divine Self of each—visible—to all assembled. In a few
moments the physical bodies disappeared—dissolving in ambient air.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

"Thus," explained Saint Germain, "is revealed to you the record of
another life, the blessing and achievement which results from—loving
acceptance—of the Supreme 'Presence' of the One God-Self Within. Let us
now go back to the Royal Teton."

We returned to the entrance and passed forward to the audience chamber.
There—on its walls—were the portraits done on gold—transferred from the
ancient temple of Mitla. We went on to the record room, and saw the
records carried by the Beautiful Glistening Beings. Other things too had
been brought—which I have not permission—to reveal.

As these experiences ended, I realized at least partially, something of
what Real Love is, for no one can possibly explain the—intense feeling
of love and gratitude—one has for the—Ascended Masters—after being
permitted the experiences I had passed through since—first meeting Saint
Germain. It can never be put in words. There is only one overwhelming
desire in Life—after such contact—and that is to "BE" what they are.

Then, one comes to realize what Jesus meant by the Father's House, and
where the home of the Soul—really is. Once he has really—even for the
fraction of a second—experienced the Ecstatic Bliss Radiating from an
Ascended Being—there is nothing in human experience he would not endure
or sacrifice—in order to reach that height of attainment—and work for

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

in order to express such Dominion and Love also.

One—Really knows—such Perfection—is—for all of God's children and is
as—Real—as Reality can be. Even the happiest life lived—by the average
human being—is certainly the husks of existence, compared to
the—Ascended State—of these Great Ones. The most beautiful and, so
called perfect, creation of human beings with all their boasted power
and accomplishment is coarse and crude, compared to the Freedom, Beauty,
Glory and Perfection that is the—daily—continual—experience—of every
one—who has raised the body—as Jesus did.

I was almost overwhelmed by a feeling of gratitude and love to Saint
Germain, as it came time to return to my body. He realized how I felt
and understood my position.

"My son," he said, "you cannot receive what has not been earned. You
deserve this and much more—which will become evident—as we advance.
Remember, however, what seems mysterious—only appears so—because it is
unexplained. When understood, all unusual occurrences will be
found—natural—and according to—Law. The following Truth shall remain
engraved on your memory forever. It is this:

"Every one of God's children who will—acknowledge and accept—the
'Presence' of the—One Mighty God—anchored Within his heart and brain—and
feel that Truth deeply—many times a day, realizing and

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

knowing God fills his mind and body—so full of—'Light'—there is no room
for anything else—he can be free. The One All-Powerful 'Presence' is the
Mighty Harmonious Activity of one's Life and affairs, and if his
attention be fixed firmly—with determination—on this Eternal Truth—no
height of attainment is—too great—for him to reach.

"There is but—One Source and Principle of Life—to which we should give
our undivided attention—that is the—God Self—Within—every—individual. To
the Great Harmonious Self—the personal self should give—conscious
recognition at all times—and keep in constant Inner Communion with It—no
matter what the outer activity of the mind is.

"This One Great Self is the Life-Energy flowing through every human body
each moment—by Which—all—are enabled to move about in the world of form.
It is the Wisdom flowing through the mind—the Will directing all
constructive activities—the Courage and Strength sustaining every
one—the Feeling of Divine Love with Which—all force—can be qualified as
it flows through the individual—and the Only Power—that can ever
accomplish any good thing. It is the—All-Victorious, Conscious
Dominion—over every condition of human activity, when released through
the personal self—without resistance or interruption.

"This Mighty God Self is Within you, is the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Supreme Ruler of
all creation, and the only Dependable, Permanent and Eternal Source of
Help in existence. Only through—Its—Love, Wisdom, and Power can anyone
ever rise into the Ascended Mastery—for
constant—conscious—communion—with It—is Freedom—and Dominion over all
human creation. When I say human creation—I mean all that is discordant
and less than Perfect."

We returned to my body, and as soon as I had reentered it, Saint Germain
took my hands and poured a stream of his Divine Energy through me to
sustain and give strength. I instantly felt revivified in both mind and
body. I sat down, fixed my attention with deep intensity upon my own God
"Presence," and offered up a prayer of gratitude for the tremendous
blessings I had been privileged to receive. He bowed graciously and
disappeared.
