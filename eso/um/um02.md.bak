### FOREWORD

IT WAS through Saint Germain's assistance that I was privileged to have
the experiences re  corded in this series of books, and that permission
has been granted for them to be put in a form which can be given to the
public. No one can realize, unless he too has had similar assistance,
how great and eternal is my love and gratitude to him and those other
Ascended Masters, whose assistance I had.

With the exception of Saint Germain, the real names of the Ascended
Masters, exact locations, records, and treasure herein described are
withheld intentionally at his command, for reasons that are obvious
because only by the Service of Love and invitation from the Ascended
Masters is the right earned to be with them in visible, tangible,
living, breathing bodies. Any other way of approach is bound to meet
with disappointment and failure, for the Great "Presence" and Power
which has guarded through the centuries, guards them still.

One's own Inner purity, strength, and attainment are the only passports
by which one enters into these activities, and association with the
Ascended Masters comes about. When an individual, by conscious
self-correction of his weaknesses, reaches a certain point, nothing in
the universe can keep him from them.

In America is one of the most Ancient Foci of the Great White
Brotherhood which has been working for man's freedom since his advent
upon this planet. Some of the activities within this retreat are
revealed to the reader that he may, if he be ready, make conscious
contact, through his own Inner Light, with the Greater Light pouring out
through this powerful center of God-radiation, and thereby drink once
again at the Fountain of the Ancient Wisdom and carry the Crystal Cup of
Peace, Love, and Strength to his weary brothers.

The purpose of putting this book into the hands of the public is to
convey to the individual the encouragement and strength that will lift
and sustain him through the transition period we are now in, and reveal
something of the sane and sound foundation upon which the future of our
country and the coming age is this hour being built.

This book is written in the embrace of the majestic, towering presence
of Mount Shasta, whose apex is robed forever in that pure, glistening
white, the symbol of the "Light of Eternity." Its pages are a record of
the way by which I was brought in touch with the Beloved Master, Saint
Germain, and those other Great Ascended Masters who labor ceaselessly to
assist the humanity of this earth, as it struggles on the path to Peace,
Love, Light, and Everlasting Perfection.

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

I, whose experience it was, held steadfastly to a great dominant desire
from Within to see, to hear, and to know, infallibly, the Truth of Life.
I was led step by step to realize and accept the Mighty God "Presence"
within my own Being—the "Light that lighteth every man that cometh into
the world"—the "Christ." A way to make contact with the Christ—"Light,"
Its All-Knowing Omnipresence, and Unerring Activity was revealed to me,
and I give it to the reader in these pages.

I can record only a part of the events that took place and the
instruction I received. One by one, my great desires have been fulfilled
because those desires were unselfish. My quest for Truth and Happiness
has been long and steady but I have found both, and no human being can
take them from me because they are Eternal and come from my own Great
God Self.

In presenting this experience, it is with the deepest prayer that the
reader may receive the "Light," be blest, and prospered on his way, as
he walks the Path of Truth which is the only place where permanent
happiness can be found. There, and there only, will the Seeker after
"Light" find Eternal Peace and Activity in the Service of Love. If my
present effort in sending these books forth into the world can carry
some of the Love, Light, and Happiness I have received to those of
earth, who also have been

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

seeking the "Light," I shall have been amply rewarded.

The saying that Truth is stranger than fiction applies to this book. It
is for the reader to accept or reject as he chooses but the Ascended
Masters, whose help I have received, have said to me often;—"The more
humanity can accept our 'Presence,' the wider they open the door for us
to pour greater and greater help to them; but the rejection of us, by
those who do not agree with this Truth, does not remove us or that Truth
from existence and activity in the universe."

Those, who do accept the Truth herein recorded, will find a new and
powerful "Force" entering their lives. Each copy carries with it this
Mighty "Presence," Its Radiation, and Sustaining Power. All, who study
these pages honestly, deeply, sincerely, and persistently, will know and
make contact with the Reality of that "Presence" and Power. To those who
read this work, I wish to say, that these experiences are as Real and
True as mankind's existence on this earth today, and that they all
occurred during August, September, and October of 1930 upon Mount
Shasta, California, U. S. A.
