*The Divine Pymander*, by Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, tr. by John
Everard, \[1650\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PREFACE**

JUDICIOUS READER,

This Book may justly challenge the first place for antiquity, from all
the Books in the World, being written some hundreds of years before
Moses his time, as I shall endeavour to make good. The Original (as far
as is known to us) is Arabic, and several Translations thereof have been
published, as Greek, Latin, French, Dutch, etc., but never English
before. It is pity the Learned Translator \[Dr. Everard\] had not lived,
and received himself, the honour, and thanks due to him from the
Englishmen for his good will to, and pains for them, in translating a
Book of such infinite worth, out of the Original, into their
Mother-tongue.

Concerning the Author of the Book itself, Four things are considerable,
viz., His Name, Learning, Country, and Time.

1\. The name by which he was commonly styled, is Hermes Trismegistus,
i.e., Mercurius ter Maximus, or, The thrice greatest Intelligencer. And
well might he be called Hermes, for he was the first Intelligencer in
the World (as we read of) that communicated Knowledge to the sons of
Men, by Writing, or Engraving. He was called Ter Maximus, for some
Reasons, which I shall afterwards mention.

2\. His Learning will appear, as by his Works; so by the right
understanding the Reason of his Name.

3\. For his Country, he was King of Egypt.

4\. For his Time, it is not without much Controversy, betwixt those that
write of this Divine, ancient Author, what time he lived in. Some say he
lived after Moses his time, giving this slender Reason for it, viz.,
Because he was named Ter Maximus: for being preferred \[Franciscus
Flussas\] (according to the Egyptian Customs) being chief Philosopher,
to be chief of the Priesthood: and from thence, to be chief in
Government, or King. But if this be all their ground, you must excuse my
dissent from then, and that for this reason, Because according to the
most learned of his followers \[Geber, Paracelsus: Henricus Nollius in
Theoria Philosophia Hermeticae, tractatu priimo.\], he was called Ter
Maximus; for having perfect, and exact Knowledge of all things contained
in the World; which things he divided into Three Kingdoms (as he calls
them), viz., Mineral, Vegetable, Animal; which Three, he did excel in
the right understanding of; also, because he attained to, and
transmitted to Posterity (although in an Ænigmatical, and obscure style)
the Knowledge of the Quintessence of the whole Universe (which Universe,
as I said before, he divided into Three Parts) otherwise called, The
great Elixir of the Philosophers; which is the Receptacle of all
Celestial and Terrestrial Virtues; which Secret, many ignorantly deny,
many have chargeably sought after, yet few, but some, yea, and the
Englishmen have happily found \[Ripley, Bacon, Norton, etc.\]. The
Description of this great Treasure, is said to be found engraved upon a
Smaragdine Table, in the Valley of Ebron, after the Flood. So that the
Reason before alleged to prove this Author to live after Moses, seem
invalid: neither doth it any way appear, that he lived in Moses his
time, although it be the opinion of some, as of John Functius, who saith
in his Chronology, That he lived Twenty-one years before the Law was
given by Moses in the Wilderness; But the Reasons that he, and others
give, are far weaker than those that I shall give, for his living before
Moses his time. My reasons for that are these:—

First, Because it is received amongst the Ancients, that he was the
first that invented the Art of communicating Knowledge to the World, by
Writing or Engraving. Now if so, then in all probability he was before
Moses; for it is said of Moses that he was from his childhood \[Acts
vii.22\] skilled in all the Egyptian Learning, which could not well have
been without the help of Literature, which we never read of any before
that invented by Hermes \[Chapter x.\].

Secondly, he is said by himself, to be the son of Saturn and by others
to be the Scribe of Saturn. Now Saturn according to Historians, lived in
the time of Sarug, Abraham’s great Grand-Father \[Sanchoniathon\]. I
shall but take in Suidas his judgment, and so rest satisfied, that he
did not live only before, but long before Moses; His words are these,
Credo Mercurium Trismegistum sapientem Egyptium floruisse ante Pharaonem
\[Suidas\].

In this Book, though so very old, is contained more true knowledge of
God and Nature, than in all the Books in the World besides, except only
Sacred Writ; And they that shall judiciously read it, and rightly
understand it, may well be excused from reading many Books; the Authors
of which, pretend so much to the knowledge of the Creator, and Creation.
If God ever appeared in any man, he appeared in him, as it appears by
this Book. That a man who had not the benefit of his Ancestors’
knowledge, being as I said before, The first inventor of the Art of
Communicating Knowledge to Posterity by writing, should be so high a
Divine, and so deep a Philosopher, seems to be a thing more of God than
of Man; and therefore it was the opinion of some That he came from
Heaven, not born upon Earth \[Goropius Becanus\]. There is contained in
this Book, that true Philosophy, without which, it is impossible ever to
attain to the height, and exactness of Piety, and Religion. According to
this Philosophy, I call him a Philosopher, that shall learn and study
the things that are, and how they are ordered, and governed, and by
whom, and for what cause, or to what end; and he that doth so, will
acknowledge thanks to, and admire the Omnipotent Creator, Preserver, and
Director of all these things. And he that shall be thus truly thankful,
may truly be called Pious and Religious: and he that is Religious, shall
more and more know where and what the Truth is: And learning that, he
shall yet be more and more Religious.

The glory and splendour of Philosophy, is an endeavoring to understand
the chief Good, as the Fountain of all Good: Now how can we come near
to, or find out the Fountain, but by making use of the Streams as a
conduct to it? The operations of Nature, are Streams running from the
Fountain of Good, which is God. I am not of the ignorant, and foolish
opinion of those that say, The greatest Philosophers are the greatest
Atheists: as if to know the works of God, and to understand his goings
forth in the Way of Nature, must necessitate a man to deny God. The
\[Job\] Scripture disapproves of this as a sottish tenet, and experience
contradicts it: For behold! Here is the greatest Philosopher, and
therefore the greatest Divine.

Read understandingly this ensuing Book (and for thy help thou mayest
make use of that voluminous Commentary written upon it \[Hanbal Offeli
Alabar\] ) then it will speak more for its Author, than can be spoken by
any man, at least by me.

Thine in the love of Truth, J.F.
