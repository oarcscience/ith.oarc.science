**THE EIGHTH BOOK, THE GREATEST EVIL IN MAN IS** **THE NOT KNOWING GOD**

WHITHER are you carried, O Men, drunken with drinking strong Wine of
Ignorance? which seeing you cannot bear, why do you vomit it up again?

2\. Stand, and be sober, and look up again with the Eyes of your heart,
and if you cannot all do so, yet do so many as you can.

3\. For the malice of Ignorance surroundeth all the Earth, and
corrupteth the Soul, shut up in the Body, not suffering it to arrive at
the Havens of Salvation.

4\. Suffer not yourselves to be carried with the Great Stream, but stem
the tide you that can lay hold of the Haven of Safety, and make your
full course towards it.

5\. Seek on that may lead you by the hand, and conduct you to the door
of Truth and Knowledge, where the clear Light is that is pure from
Darkness, where there is not one drunken, but all are sober, and in
their heart look up to him, whose pleasure it is to be seen.

6\. For he cannot be heard with ears, nor seen with eyes, nor expressed
in words; but only in mind and heart.

7\. But first thou must tear to pieces, and break through the garment
thou wearest, the web of Ignorance; the foundation of all Mischief; the
bond of Corruption; the dark Coverture; the living Death; the sensible
Carcass; the Sepulchre, carried about with us; the domestical Thief,
which in what he loves us, hates us, envies us.

8\. Such is the hurtful Apparel, wherewith thou art clothed, which draws
and pulls thee downward by its own self, lest looking upward and seeing
the beauty of Truth, and the Good that is reposed therein, thou shouldst
hate the wickedness of this Garment and understand the traps and
ambushes which it had laid for thee.

9\. Therefore doth it labour to make good those things that seem, and
are by the senses, judged and determined; and the things that are truly,
it hides, and envelopeth in much matter, filling what it presents unto
thee, with hateful pleasure, that thou canst neither hear what thou
shouldst hear, nor see what thou shouldst see.

The End of the Eighth Book,  
THE GREATEST EVIL IN MAN IS  
THE NOT KNOWING GOD.
