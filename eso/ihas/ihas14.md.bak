### CHAPTER XI

#### THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE MYSTERIES

The participants in the mysteries are generally known, and no secret has
been made of the general personnel and procedure. It is only sought here
to impart a greater sense of reality to the data already given by a
fuller exposition and a more pointed reference to the parts played by
such during the ceremony. At this stage the student would be wise to
bear in mind certain things as he ponders upon the mysteries touched
upon here:—

That care must be taken to interpret all here given in terms of spirit
and not of matter or form. We are dealing entirely with the subjective
or consciousness aspect of manifestation, and with that which lies back
of the objective form. This realisation will save the student from much
later confusion.

That we are considering facts which are substantial and real on the
*mental plane*—the plane on which all the major initiations take
place—but which are not materialised on the physical plane, and are not
physical plane phenomena. The link between the two planes exists in the
continuity of consciousness which the initiate will have developed, and
which will enable him to bring through to the physical brain,
occurrences and happenings upon the subjective planes of life.

Corroboration of these occurrences, and proof of the accuracy of the
transmitted knowledge will demonstrate as follows:—

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

*In and through the etheric centres*. These centres will be greatly
stimulated, and will, through their increased inherent energy, enable
the initiate to accomplish more in the path of service than he ever
before dreamed possible. His dreams and ideals become, not
possibilities, but demonstrating facts in manifestation.

The *physical centres*, such as the pineal gland and the pituitary body,
will begin to develop rapidly, and he will become conscious of the
awakening of the "siddhis," or powers of the soul, in the higher
connotation of the words. He will be aware of the process of conscious
control, and of the self-initiated manipulations of the above powers. He
will realise the methods of egoic contact and the right direction of
force.

*The nervous system*, through which the emotional body or astral nature
works, will become highly sensitised, yet strong withal. The brain will
become ever more rapidly an acute transmitter of the inner impulses.
This fact is of real importance, and will bring about—as its
significance becomes more apparent—a revolution in the attitude of
educators, of physicians and others, to the development of the nervous
system and the healing of nervous disorders.

*Occult memory*. The initiate finally becomes aware increasingly of the
growth of that inner recollection, or "occult memory," which concerns
the work of the Hierarchy and primarily his share in the general plan.
When the initiate, who occultly recalls, in his waking consciousness, a
ceremonial fact, finds all these manifestations of increased growth and
conscious realisation in himself, then the truth of his inner assurance
is proven and substantiated to him.

It must be remembered that this inner substantiation is of no value to
anyone but the initiate. He has to prove himself to the outer world
through his life of service and the work accomplished, and thereby call
forth from all his

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

environing associates a recognition that will show itself in a
sanctified emulation and a strenuous effort to tread the same path,
actuated ever by the same motive,—that of service and brotherhood, not
self-aggrandisement and selfish acquirement. It should also be
remembered that if the above is true in connection with the work, it is
still more true in connection with the initiate himself. *Initiation is
a strictly personal matter with a universal application*. It rests upon
his inner attainment. The initiate will know for himself when the event
occurs and needs no one to tell him of it. The expansion of
consciousness called initiation must include the physical brain or it is
of no value. As those lesser expansions of consciousness which we
undergo normally every day, and call "learning" something or other, have
reference to the apprehension by the physical brain of an imparted fact
or apprehended circumstance, so with the greater expansions which are
the outcome of the many lesser.

At the same time, it is quite possible for men to be functioning on the
physical plane and to be actively employed in world service who have no
recollection of having undergone the initiatory process, yet who,
nevertheless, may have taken the first or second initiation in a
previous or earlier life. This is the result, simply, of a lack of
"bridging" from one life to another, or it may be the outcome of a
definite decision by the Ego. A man may be able better to work off
certain karma and to carry out certain work for the Lodge if he is free
from occult occupation and mystic introspection during the period of any
one earth life. There are many such amongst the sons of men at this time
who have previously taken the first initiation, and a few who have taken
the second, but who are nevertheless quite unaware of it, yet their
centres and nervous organisation carry proof to those who have the inner
vision. If initiation is taken for

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the first time in any life, the recollection of it extends to the
physical brain.

Curiosity, or even ordinary good living, never brought a man to the
Portal of Initiation. Curiosity, by arousing a strong vibration in a
man's lower nature, only serves to swing him away from, instead of
towards the goal he is interested in; whilst ordinary good living, when
not furthered by a life of utter sacrifice for others, and by a
reticence, humility, and disinterestedness of a very unusual kind, may
serve to build good vehicles which will be of use in another
incarnation, but will not serve to break down those barriers, outer and
inner, and overcome those opposing forces and energies which stand
between a "good" man and the ceremony of initiation.

The Path of Discipleship is a difficult one to tread, and the Path of
Initiation harder still; an initiate is but a battle-scarred warrior,
the victor in many a hard-won fight; he speaks not of his achievements,
for he is too busy with the great work in hand; he makes no reference to
himself or to all that he has accomplished, save to deprecate the
littleness of what has been done. Nevertheless, to the world he is ever
a man of large influence, the wielder of spiritual power, the embodier
of ideals, the worker for humanity, who unfailingly brings results which
succeeding generations will recognise. He is one who, in spite of all
this great achievement, is seldom understood by his own generation. He
is frequently the butt of men's tongues, and frequently all that he does
is misinterpreted; he lays his all—time, money, influence, reputation,
and all that the world considers worth while—upon the altar of
altruistic service, and frequently offers his life as a final gift, only
to find that those whom he has served throw his gift back to him, scorn
his renunciation, and label him with unsavory names. But the initiate
cares not, for his is the privilege to see somewhat

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

into the future, and therefore he realises that the force he has
generated will in due course of time bring to fulfilment the plan; he
knows also that his name and effort are noted in the archives of the
Lodge, and that the "Silent Watcher" over the affairs of men has taken
notice.

*Planetary Existences*.

In considering now the personalities taking part in the initiation
ceremonies, the first to be dealt with are Those Who are termed
Planetary Existences. This refers to those great Beings who, for a
period of planetary manifestation, overshadow or stay with our humanity.
They are not very many in number, for the majority of the Great Ones
pass on steadily and increasingly to other and higher work, as Their
places can be taken and Their functions carried on by members of our
earth evolution, both deva and human.

Among Those directly connected with our Lodge of Masters in its various
divisions upon the planet, the following might be enumerated:—

The "*Silent Watcher*," that great Entity Who is the informing life of
the planet, and Who holds the same position to the Lord of the World,
Sanat Kumara, as the Ego does to the lower self of man. Some idea of the
high stage of evolution of this Great Being may be gathered from the
analogous degree of evolutionary difference existing between a human
being and a perfected adept. From the standpoint of our planetary
scheme, this great Life has no greater, and He is, as far as we are
concerned, a correspondence to the personal God of the Christian. He
works through His representative on the physical plane, Sanat Kumara,
Who is the focal point for His life and energy. He holds the world
within His aura. This great Existence is only contacted directly by the
adept who has taken the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

fifth initiation, and is proceeding to take the other two, the sixth and
seventh. Once a year, at the Wesak Festival, the Lord Buddha, sanctioned
by the Lord of the World, carries to the assembled humanity a dual
stream of force, that emanating from the Silent Watcher, supplemented by
the more focalised energy of the Lord of the World. This dual energy He
pours out in blessing over the people gathered at the ceremony in the
Himalayas, and from them in turn it flows out to all peoples and tongues
and races. It may not perhaps be generally known that at a certain
crisis during the Great War the Hierarchy of our planet deemed it well
nigh necessary to invoke the aid of the Silent Watcher, and—employing
the great mantram whereby the Buddha can be reached—called the attention
of the latter, and sought his agency with the Planetary Logos. In
consultation between the Planetary Logos, the Lord of the World, one of
the Buddhas of Activity, the Buddha, the Mahachohan, and the Manu (these
names are given in order of their relative evolutionary stage) it was
decided to watch proceedings a little longer before interfering with the
trend of affairs, as the karma of the planet would have been delayed
should the strife have been ended toc soon. Their confidence in the
ability of men duly to adjust conditions was justified, and interference
proved needless. This conference took place at Shamballa. This is
mentioned to show the close scrutiny given to everything concerning the
affairs of men by the various Planetary Existences. It is literally
true, in an occult sense, that "not a sparrow falleth" without its fall
being noticed.

It may be asked why the Bodhisattva was not included in the conference.
The reason was that the war was in the department of the Manu, and
members of the Hierarchy concern Themselves with that which is strictly
Their own business; the Mahachohan, being the embodiment of the

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

intelligent or manasic principle, participates in all conferences. In
the next great strife the department of religions will be involved, and
the Bodhisattva intimately concerned. His Brother, the Manu, will then
be relatively exempt, and will proceed with His own affairs. And yet
withal there is the closest co-operation in all departments, with no
loss of energy. Owing to the unity of consciousness of those who are
free from the three lower planes, what transpires in one department is
known in the others.

As the Planetary Logos is only concerned in the two final initiations,
which are not compulsory as are the earlier five, it serves no purpose
to enlarge upon His work. These initiations are taken upon the buddhic
and atmic planes, whereas the first five are taken upon the mental.

The *Lord of the World*, the One Initiator, He Who is called in the
Bible "The Ancient of Days," and in the Hindu Scriptures the First
Kumara, He, Sanat Kumara it is, Who from His throne at Shamballa in the
Gobi desert, presides over the Lodge of Masters, and holds in His hands
the reins of government in all the three departments. Called in some
Scriptures "the Great Sacrifice," He has chosen to watch over the
evolution of men and devas until all have been occultly "saved." He it
is Who decides upon the "advancements" in the different departments, and
Who settles who shall fill the vacant posts; He it is Who, four times a
year, meets in conference with all the Chohans and Masters, and
authorises what shall be done to further the ends of evolution.

Occasionally, too, He meets with initiates of lesser degree, but only at
times of great crises, when some individual is given the opportunity to
bring peace out of strife, and to kindle a blaze whereby rapidly
crystallising forms are destroyed and the imprisoned life consequently
set free.

At stated periods in the year the Lodge meets, and at

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

the Wesak Festival gathers under His jurisdiction for three purposes:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. To contact planetary force through the medium of the Buddha.

2\. To hold the principal of the quarterly conferences.

3\. To admit to the ceremony of initiation those who are ready in all
grades.

</div>

Three other initiation ceremonies take place during the year:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. For the minor initiations administered by the Bodhisattva, all of
which are in the department of the Mahachohan, and on one or other of
the four lesser rays, the rays of attribute.

2\. For the major initiations on one or other of the three major rays,
the rays of aspect, which are administered by the Bodhisattva, and are
therefore the first two initiations.

3\. For the higher three initiations at which Sanat Kumara wields the
Rod.

</div>

At all initiations the Lord of the World is present, but at the first
two He holds a position similar to that held by the Silent Watcher, when
Sanat Kumara administers the oath at the third, fourth and fifth
initiations. His power streams forth and the flashing forth of the star
before the initiate is the signal of His approval, but the initiate does
not see Him face to face until the third initiation.

The function of the *three Kumaras*, or the three Buddhas of Activity at
initiation is interesting. They are three aspects of the one aspect, and
the pupils of Sanat Kumara. Though Their functions are many and varied,
and concern primarily the forces and energies of nature, and the
direction

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

of the building agencies, They have a vital connection with the
applicant for initiation, inasmuch as They each embody the force or
energy of one or other of the three higher subplanes of the mental
plane. Therefore at the third initiation one of these Kumaras transmits
to the causal body of the initiate that energy which destroys third
subplane matter, and thus brings about part of the destruction of the
vehicle; at the fourth initiation another Buddha transmits second plane
force, and at the fifth, first subplane force is similarly passed into
the remaining atoms of the causal vehicle, producing the final
liberation. The work done by the second Kumara, with second subplane
force, is in this solar system the most important in connection with the
egoic body, and produces its complete dissipation, whereas the final
application causes the atoms themselves (which formed that body) to
disperse.

During the initiation ceremony, when the initiate stands before the Lord
of the World, these three great Beings form a triangle, within whose
lines of force the initiate finds himself. At the first two initiations,
wherein the Bodhisattva functions as the Hierophant, the Mahachohan, the
Manu, and a Chohan who temporarily represents the second department
perform a similar office. At the highest two initiations, those three
Kumaras who are called "the esoteric Kumaras" form a triangle wherein
the initiate stands, when he faces the Planetary Logos.

These facts are imparted to teach two things, first, the unity of the
method, second, that the truism "as above so below" is an occult fact in
nature.

At the final two initiations many members of the Hierarchy who are, if
one might so express it, extra-planetary, and who function outside the
dense physical and the etheric globe of our planet, take part, but a
stricter enumeration is needless. Sanat Kumara is still the Hierophant,
yet in a

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

very esoteric manner it is the Planetary Logos Himself who officiates.
They are merged at that time into one Identity, manifesting different
aspects.

Suffice it to say, in concluding this brief statement, that the making
of an initiate is an affair with a dual effect, for it involves ever a
passing on of some adept or initiate to a higher grade or to other work,
and the coming in under the Law of some human being who is in process of
attainment. Therefore it is a thing of great moment, involving group
activity, group loyalty, and united endeavour, and much may depend upon
the wisdom of admitting a man to high office and to a place in the
council chambers of the Hierarchy.

*The Departmental Heads*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Manu.

The Bodhisattva.

The Mahachohan.

</div>

As has been said, these three great Beings, represent the triplicity of
all manifestation, and might be expressed under the following form,
remembering that all this deals with subjectivity, and therefore with
the evolution of consciousness and primarily with self-consciousness in
man.

<div align="center">

|               |                   |                       |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
|               | *Consciousness*   |                       |
| *The Manu*    | *The Bodhisattva* | *The Mahachohan*      |
| Matter aspect | Spirit aspect     | Intelligence aspect.  |
| Form          | Life              | Mind.                 |
| The Not-Self  | The Self          | The relation between. |
| Body          | Spirit            | Soul.                 |

</div>

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

Or, in words strictly dealing with self-conscious realisation.

<div align="center">

|            |          |               |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Politics   | Religion | Science.      |
| Government | Beliefs  | Civilisation. |
| Races      | Faiths   | Education.    |

</div>

All human beings belong to one or other of these three departments, and
all are of equal importance, for Spirit and matter are one. All are so
interdependent, being but expressions of one life, that the endeavour to
express the functions of the three departments in tabular form is liable
to lead to error.

The three Great Lords closely co-operate in the work, for that work is
one, just as man, though a triplicity, is yet an individual unit. The
human being is a form through which a spiritual life or entity is
manifesting, and employing the intelligence under evolutionary law.

Therefore the Great Lords are closely connected with the initiations of
a human unit. They are too occupied with greater affairs and with group
activities to have any relationship with a man until he stands upon the
probationary path. When he has, through his own effort, brought himself
on to the Path of Discipleship, the particular Master Who has him under
supervision reports to the Head of one of the three departments (this
being dependent upon a man's ray) that he is nearing the Portal of
Initiation and should be ready for the great step during such and such a
life. Each life, and later each year, report is made, until the final
year upon the Path of Probation, when closer and more frequent reports
are handed in. During this final year also, the applicant's name is
submitted to the Lodge, and after his own Master has reported upon him,
and his record has been briefly summarised, his name is balloted, and
sponsors are arranged.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

During the initiation ceremony the important factors are:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. The Initiator.

2\. The triangle of force formed by three adepts or three Kumaras.

3\. The sponsors.

</div>

In the case of the first two initiations, two Masters stand, one on each
side of the applicant, within the triangle; at the third, fourth and
fifth initiations, the Mahachohan and the Bodhisattva perform the
function of sponsor; at the sixth and seventh initiations two great
Beings, Who must remain nameless, stand within the esoteric triangle.
The work of the sponsors is to pass through Their bodies the force or
electrical energy emanating from the Rod of Initiation. This force,
through radiation, circles around the triangle and is supplemented by
the force of the three guardians; it next passes through the centres of
the sponsors, being transmitted by an act of will to the initiate.

Enough has been said elsewhere in this book anent the Lodge of Masters
and Their relation to the applicant for initiation, whilst the work of
the initiate himself has been likewise touched upon. That work is not
unknown to the children of men everywhere, but remains as yet an ideal
and a far-off possibility. Yet when a man strives to reach that ideal,
to make it a demonstrating fact within himself, he will find that it
becomes not only a possibility, but something attainable, provided he
strives sufficiently. The first initiation is within the reach of many,
but the necessary one-pointedness and the firm belief in the reality
ahead, coupled to a willingness to sacrifice all rather than turn back,
are deterrents to the many. If this book serves no other purpose than to
spur some one to renewed believing effort, it will not have been written
in vain.
