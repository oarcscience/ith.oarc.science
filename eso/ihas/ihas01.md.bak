### THE LORD BUDDHA HAS SAID

that we must not believe in a thing said merely because it is said; nor
traditions because they have been handed down from antiquity; nor
rumors, as such; nor writings by sages, because sages wrote them: nor
fancies that we may suspect to have been inspired in us by a Deva (that
is, in presumed spiritual inspiration); nor from inferences drawn from
some haphazard assumption we may have made; nor because of what seems an
analogical necessity; nor on the mere authority of our teachers or
masters. But we are to believe when the writing, doctrine, or saying is
corroborated by our own reason and consciousness. "For this," says he in
concluding, "I taught you not to believe merely because you have heard,
but when you believed of your consciousness, then to act accordingly and
abundantly."

(Secret Doctrine, Vol. III, page 401.)

### FOREWORD

The subject of Initiation is one that has a great fascination for
thinkers of all schools of thought, and even those who remain sceptical
and critical would like to believe that this ultimate attainment is
possible. To those who do not believe that such a goal is possible this
book is offered for what it may be worth as a formulation of an
interesting hypothesis. To those who anticipate such a consummation of
all their endeavours, this book is tendered in the hope that it may
prove an inspiration and a help.

Among occidental thinkers at this time there is a wide diversity of view
upon this momentous subject. There are those who think that it is not of
sufficient immediate importance to engross their attention, and that if
the average man adheres to the path of duty and high-minded attention to
the business in hand, he will duly arrive at his destination. This is
undoubtedly true, yet as capacity for increased service, and the
development of powers to be used in the helping of the race are the
reward of the man who is willing to make the increased effort and to pay
the price which initiation demands, perhaps this book may spur some on
to attainment who might otherwise have drifted slowly towards their
goal. They will then become givers, and not the recipients of help.

There are those again who consider that the teaching hitherto given out
in various books concerning initiation, vii

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

is erroneous. Initiation has been made out to be fairly easy of
attainment, and to call for no such rectitude of character as might have
been anticipated. The following chapters may serve to show that the
criticism is not unmerited. Initiation is profoundly difficult of
attainment, and calls for a strenuous discipline of the entire lower
nature, and a life of self-effacing and self-abnegating devotion. At the
same time, it must be remembered that the earlier teaching is right in
essence, though belittled in interpretation.

Again, there are some who are interested, yet who feel the possibilities
involved are too far advanced for them. and that they need not occupy
themselves with them at this stage of their evolution. This book seeks
to make it apparent that here and now the average man may begin to build
that character and to lay those foundations of knowledge which are
necessary before even the Path of Discipleship can be trodden. Due
preparation may now be made, and men and women everywhere may—if they
choose—fit themselves for the condition of discipleship and tread the
Probationary Path.

Hundreds in the East and in the West are pressing onwards towards this
goal. and in the unity of the one ideal, in their common aspiration and
endeavour, they will meet before the one Portal. They will then
recognise themselves as brothers, severed by tongue and apparent
diversity of belief, hut fundamentally holding to the same one truth and
serving the same God.

Alice A. Bailey.
