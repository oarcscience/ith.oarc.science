# The Fraternity of the Rose Cross

WHO were the Rosicrucians? Were they an organization of profound
thinkers rebelling against the inquisitional religious and philosophical
limitations of their time or were they isolated transcendentalists
united only by the similarity of their viewpoints and deductions? Where
was the "House of the Holy Spirit, " in which, according to their
manifestoes, they met once a year to plan the future activities of their
Order? Who was the mysterious person referred to as "Our Illustrious
Father and Brother C.R.C."? Did those three letters actually stand for
the words "Christian Rosie Cross"? Was Christian Rosencreutz, the
supposed author of the *Chymical Nuptials*, the same person who with
three others founded "The Society of the Rose Cross"?

What relationship existed between Rosicrucianism and mediæval
Freemasonry? Why were the destinies of these two organizations so
closely interwoven? Is the "Brotherhood of the Rose Cross" the
much-sought-after link connecting the Freemasonry of the Middle Ages
with the symbolism and mysticism of antiquity, and are its secrets being
perpetuated by modern Masonry? Did the original Rosicrucian Order
disintegrate in the latter part of the eighteenth century, or does the
Society still exist as an organization, maintaining the same secrecy for
which it was originally famous? What was the true purpose for which the
"Brotherhood of the Rose Cross" was formed? Were the Rosicrucians a
religious and philosophic brotherhood, as they claimed to be, or were
their avowed tenets a blind to conceal the true object of the
Fraternity, which possibly was the political control of Europe? These
are some of the problems involved in the study of Rosicrucianism.

There are four distinct theories regarding the Rosicrucian enigma. Each
is the result of a careful consideration of the evidence by scholars who
have spent their lives ransacking the archives of Hermetic lore. The
conclusions reached demonstrate clearly the inadequacy of the records
available concerning the genesis and early activities of the "Brethren
of the Rose Cross."

### THE FIRST POSTULATE

It is assumed that the Rosicrucian Order existed historically in
accordance with the description of its foundation and subsequent
activities published in its manifesto, the *Fama Fraternitatis*, which
is believed to have been written in the year 1610, but apparently did
not appear in print until 1614, although an earlier edition is suspected
by some authorities. Intelligent consideration of the origin of
Rosicrucianism requires a familiarity with the contents of the first and
most important of its documents. The *Fama Fraternitatis* begins with a
reminder to all the world of God's goodness and mercy, and it warns the
intelligentsia that their egotism and covetousness cause them to follow
after false prophets and to ignore the true knowledge which God in His
goodness has revealed to them. Hence, a reformation is necessary, and
God has raised up philosophers and sages for this purpose.

In order to assist in bringing about the reformation, a mysterious
person called "The Highly Illuminated Father C.R.C.," a German by birth,
descended of a noble family, but himself a poor man, instituted the
"Secret Society of the Rose Cross." C.R.C. was placed in a cloister when
only five years of age, but later becoming dissatisfied with its
educational system, he associated himself with a brother of Holy Orders
who was setting forth on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. They started out
together, but the brother died at Cyprus and C.R.C! continued alone to
Damascus. Poor health prevented him from reaching Jerusalem, so he
remained at Damascus, studying with the philosophers who dwelt there.

While pursuing his studies, he heard of a group of mystics and
Qabbalists abiding in the mystic Arabian city of Damcar. Giving up his
desire to visit Jerusalem, he arranged with the Arabians for his
transportation to Damcar. C.R.C. was but sixteen years of age when he
arrived at Damcar. He was received as one who had been long expected, a
comrade and a friend in philosophy, and was instructed in the secrets of
the Arabian adepts. While there, C.R.C. learned the Arabic tongue and
translated the sacred book *M* into Latin; and upon returning to Europe
he brought this important volume with him.

After studying three years in Damcar, C.R.C. departed for the city of
Fez, where the Arabian magicians declared further information would be
given him. At Fez he was instructed how to communicate with the
Elementary inhabitants \[probably the Nature spirits\], and these
disclosed to him many other great secrets of Nature. While the
philosophers in Fez were not so great as those in Damcar, the previous
experiences of C.R.C. enabled him to distinguish the true from the false
and thus add greatly to his store of knowledge.

After two years in Fez, C.R.C. sailed for Spain, carrying with him many
treasures, among them rare plants and animals accumulated during his
wanderings. He fondly hoped that the learned men of Europe would receive
with gratitude the rare intellectual and material treasures which he had
brought for their consideration. Instead he encountered only ridicule,
for the so-called wise were afraid to admit their previous ignorance
lest their prestige be impaired. At this point in the narrative is an
interpolation stating that Paracelsus, while not a member of the
"Fraternity of the Rose Cross," had read the book *M* and from a
consideration of its contents had secured information which made him the
foremost physician of mediæval Europe.

Tired, but not discouraged, as the result of the fruitlessness of his
efforts, C.R.C. returned to Germany, where he built a house in which he
could quietly carry on his study and research. He also manufactured a
number of rare scientific instruments for research purposes. While he
could have made himself famous had he cared to commercialize his
knowledge, he preferred the companionship of God to the esteem of men.

After five years of retirement he decided to renew his struggle for a
reformation of the arts and sciences of his day, this time with the aid
of a few trusted friends. He sent to the cloister where his early
training had been received and called to himself three brethren, whom he
bound by an oath to preserve inviolate the secrets he should impart and
to write down for the sake of posterity the information

THE GOLDEN AND ROSY CROSS.  

From *Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer*.

It is said of this cross that it is made of spiritual gold and that each
Brother wears it upon his breast. It bears the alchemical symbols of
salt, sulphur, and mercury; also a star of the planets; and around it
are the four words FAITH, HOPE, LOVE, and PATIENCE. The double-headed
eagle, or Phœnix, subtly foreshadows the ultimate androgynous state of
the human creature. Rosicrucian alchemy was not concerned with metals
alone. Man's own body was the alchemical laboratory, and none could
reach Rosicrucian adeptship until he had performed the supreme
experiment of transmutation by changing the base metals of ignorance
into the pure gold of wisdom and understanding.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

he should dictate. These four founded the "Fraternity of the Rose
Cross." They prepared its secret cipher language and, according to the
*Fama*, a great dictionary in which all forms of wisdom were classified
to the glorification of God. They also began the work of transcribing
the book *M*, but found the task too difficult because of the demands of
the great numbers of sick who came to them for healing.

Having completed a newer and larger building, which they called the
"House of the Holy Spirit," they decided to include four new members in
the Fraternity, thus increasing the number to eight, seven of whom were
German. All were unmarried. Working industriously together, they
speedily completed the arduous labor of preparing the documents,
instructions, and arcana of the Order. They also put the house called
"Sancti Spiritus" in order.

They then decided to separate and visit the other countries of the
earth, not only that their wisdom might be given to others who deserved
it but also that they might check and correct any mistakes existing in
their own system. Before separating, the Brethren prepared six rules, or
by-laws, and each bound himself to obey them. The first rule was that
they should take to themselves no other dignity or credit than that they
were willing to heal the sick without charge. The second was that from
that time on forever they should wear no special robe or garment, but
should dress according to the custom of the country wherein they dwelt.
The third stated that every year upon a certain day they should meet in
the "House of the Holy Spirit," or, if unable to do so, should be
represented by an epistle. The fourth decreed that each member should
search for a worthy person to succeed him at his own demise. The fifth
stated that the letters "R.C." should be their seal, mark, and character
from that time onward. The sixth specified that the Fraternity should
remain unknown to the world for a period of one hundred years.

After they had sworn to this code five of the Brothers departed to
distant lands, and a year later two of the others also went their way,
leaving Father C.R. C. alone in the "House of the Holy Spirit." Year
after year they met with great joy, for they had quietly and sincerely
promulgated their doctrines among the wise of the earth.

When the first of the Order died in England, it was decided that the
burial places of the members should be secret. Soon afterward Father
C.R.C. called the remaining six together, and it is supposed that then
he prepared his own symbolic tomb. The Fama records that none of the
Brothers alive at the time of its writing knew when Father C.R.C. died
or where he was buried. His body was accidentally discovered 120 years
after his death when one of the Brothers, who possessed considerable
architectural skill, decided to make some alterations in the "House of
the Holy Spirit." \[It is only suspected that the tomb was in this
building.\]

While making his alterations, the Brother discovered a memorial tablet
upon which were inscribed the names of the early members of the Order.
This he decided to transfer to a more imposing chapel, for at that time
no one knew in what country Father C.R.C. had died, this information
having been concealed by the original members. In attempting to remove
the memorial tablet, which was held in place by a large nail, some
stones and plastering were broken from the wall, disclosing a door
concealed in the masonry. The members of the Order immediately cleared
away the rest of the débris and uncovered the entrance to a vault. Upon
the door in large letters were the words: POST CXX ANNOS PATEBO. This,
according to the mystic interpretation of the Brethren, meant, "In 120
years I shall come forth."

The following morning the door was opened and the members entered a
vault with seven sides and seven corners, each side five feet broad and
eight feet high. Although the sun never penetrated this tomb, it was
brilliantly illuminated by a mysterious light in the ceiling. In the
center was a circular altar, upon which were brass plates engraved with
strange characters. In each of the seven sides was a small door which,
upon being opened, revealed a number of boxes filled with books, secret
instructions, and the supposedly lost arcanum of the Fraternity.

Upon moving the altar to one side a brass cover was disclosed. Lifting
this revealed a body, presumedly that of C.R.C., which, although it had
lain there 120 years, was as well preserved as though it had just been
interred. It was ornamented and attired in the robes of the Order, and
in one hand was clasped a mysterious parchment which, next to the Bible,
was the most valued possession of the Society. After thoroughly
investigating the contents of the secret chamber, the brass plate and
altar were put back in place, the door of the vault was again sealed,
and the Brothers went their respective ways, their spirits raised and
their faith increased by the miraculous spectacle which they had beheld.

The document ends by saying in effect, "In accordance with the will of
Father C.R.C., the *Fama* has been prepared and sent forth to the wise
and learned of all Europe in five languages, that all may know and
understand the secrets of the august Fraternity. All of sincere soul who
labor for the glory of God are invited to communicate with the Brethren
and are promised that their appeal shall be heard, regardless of where
they are or how the messages are sent. At the same time, those of
selfish and ulterior motives are warned that only sorrow and misery will
attend any who attempt to discover the Fraternity without a clean heart
and a pure mind."

Such, in brief, is the story of the *Fama Fraternitatis*. Those who
accept it literally regard Father C.R.C. as the actual founder of the
Brotherhood, which he is believed to have organized about 1400. The fact
that historical corroboration of the important points of the Fama has
never been discovered is held against this theory. There is no proof
that Father C.R.C. ever approached the learned men of Spain. The
mysterious city of Damcar cannot be found, and there is no record that
anywhere in Germany there existed a place where great numbers of the
halt and sick came and were mysteriously healed. A. E. Waite's *The
Secret Tradition in Freemasonry* contains a picture of Father C.R.C.
showing him with a long beard upon his breast, sitting before a table
upon which burns a candle. One hand is supporting his head and the other
is resting the tip of its index finger on the temple of a human skull.
The picture, however (see plate at head of chapter), proves nothing.
Father C.R.C. was never seen by other than members of his own Order, and
they did not preserve a description of him. That his name was Christian
Rosencreutz is most improbable, as the two were not even associated
until the writing of the *Chymical Nuptials*.

### THE SECOND POSTULATE

Those Masonic brethren who have investigated the subject accept the
historical existence of the "Brotherhood of the Rose Cross" but are
divided concerning the origin of the Order. One group holds the society
originated in mediæval Europe as an outgrowth of alchemical speculation.
Robert Macoy, 33°, believes that Johann Valentin Andreæ, a German
theologian, was the true founder, and he also believes it possible that
this divine merely reformed and amplified an existing society which had
been founded by Sir Henry Cornelius Agrippa. Some believe that
Rosicrucianism represented the first European invasion of Buddhist and
Brahmin culture. Still others hold the opinion that the "Society of the
Rose Cross" was founded in Egypt during n the philosophic supremacy of
that empire, and that it also perpetuated the Mysteries of ancient
Persia and Chaldea.

In his *Anacalypsis*, Godfrey Higgins writes: "The Rosicrucians of
Germany are quite ignorant of their origin; but, by tradition, they
suppose themselves descendants of the ancient Egyptians, Chaldeans,
Magi, and Gymnosophists." (The last was a name given by the followers of
Alexander the Great to a caste of naked Wise Men whom they found
meditating along the river banks in India.) The consensus among these
factions is that the story of Father C.R.C., like the Masonic legend of
Hiram Abiff, is an allegory and should not be considered literally. A
similar problem has confronted students of the Bible, who have found not
only difficult, but in the majority of cases impossible, their efforts
to substantiate the historical interpretation of the Scriptures.

Admitting the existence of the Rosicrucians as a secret society with
both philosophic and political ends, it is remarkable that an
organization with members in all parts of Europe could maintain absolute
secrecy throughout the centuries. Nevertheless, the "Brothers of the
Rose Cross" were apparently able to accomplish this. A great number of
scholars and philosophers, among them Sir Francis Bacon and Wolfgang von
Goethe, have been suspected of affiliation with the Order, but their
connection has not been established to the satisfaction of prosaic
historians. Pseudo-Rosicrucians abounded, but the true members of the
"Ancient and Secret Order of The Unknown Philosophers" have successfully
lived up to their name; to this day they remain unknown.

During the Middle Ages a number of tracts appeared, purporting to be
from the pens of Rosicrucians. Many of them, however, were spurious,
being issued for their self-aggrandizement by unscrupulous persons who
used the revered and magic name Rosicrucian in the hope of gaining
religious or political power. This has greatly complicated

<span id="img_13800"></span>

[![THE CRUCIFIED ROSE.](tn/13800.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/13800.jpg.md)  
THE CRUCIFIED ROSE.  

The original symbol of the Rosicrucian Fraternity was a hieroglyphic
rose crucified upon a cross. The cross was often raised upon a
three-stepped Calvary. Occasionally the symbol of a cross rising from a
rose was used in connection with their activities. The Rosicrucian rose
was drawn upon the Round Table of King Arthur, and is the central motif
for the links forming the chain from which the "Great George" is
suspended among the jewels of The Order of the Garter. Hargrave Jennings
suspects this Order of having some connection with the Rosicrucians.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

the work of investigating the Society. One group of pseudo-Rosicrucians
went so far as to supply its members with a black cord by which they
were to know each other, and warned them that if they broke their vow of
secrecy the cord would be used to strangle them. Few of the principles
of Rosicrucianism have been preserved in literature, for the original
Fraternity published only fragmentary accounts of its principles and
activities.

In his *Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians*, Dr. Franz Hartmann
describes the Fraternity as "A secret society of men possessing
superhuman--if not supernatural--powers; they were said to be able to
prophesy future events, to penetrate into the deepest mysteries of
Nature, to transform Iron, Copper, Lead, or Mercury into Gold, to
prepare an *Elixir of Life*, or *Universal Panacea*, by the use of which
they could preserve their youth and manhood; and moreover it was
believed that they could command the *Elemental Spirits of Nature*, and
knew the secret of the *Philosopher's Stone*, a substance which rendered
him who possessed it all-powerful, immortal, and supremely wise."

The same author further defines a Rosicrucian as "A person who by the
process of spiritual awakening has attained a *practical knowledge* of
the secret significance of the *Rose* and the *Cross*. \* \* \* To call
a person a Rosicrucian does not make him one, nor does the act of
calling a person a Christian make him a Christ. The real Rosicrucian or
Mason cannot be made; he must grow to be one by the expansion and
unfoldment of the divine power within his own heart. The inattention to
this truth is the cause that many churches and secret societies are far
from being that which their names express."

The symbolic principles of Rosicrucianism are so profound that even
today they are little appreciated. Their charts and diagrams are
concerned with weighty cosmic principles which they treat with a
philosophic understanding decidedly refreshing when compared with the
orthodox narrowness prevalent in their day. According to the available
records, the Rosicrucians were bound together by mutual aspirations
rather than by the laws of a fraternity. The "Brothers of the Rose
Cross" are believed to have lived unobtrusively, laboring industriously
in trades and professions, disclosing their secret affiliation to no
one--in many cases not even to their own families. After the death of
C.R.C., most of the Brethren apparently had no central meeting place.
Whatever initiatory ritual the Order possessed was so closely guarded
that it has never been revealed. Doubtless it was couched in chemical
terminology.

Efforts to join the Order were apparently futile, for the Rosicrucians
always chose their disciples. Having agreed on one who they believed
would do honor to their illustrious fraternity, they communicated with
him in one of many mysterious ways. He might receive a letter, either
anonymous or with a peculiar seal, usually bearing the letters "C.R.C.
"or "R.C. "upon it. He would be instructed to go to a certain place at
an appointed time. What was disclosed to him he never revealed, although
in many cases his later writings showed that a new influence had come
into his life, deepening his understanding and broadening his intellect.
A few have written allegorically concerning what they beheld when in the
august presence of the "Brethren of the Rose Cross."

Alchemists were sometimes visited in their laboratories by mysterious
strangers, who delivered learned discourses concerning the secret
processes of the Hermetic arts and, after disclosing certain processes,
departed, leaving no trace. Others declared that the "Brothers of the
Rose Cross" communicated with them through dreams and visions, revealing
the secrets of Hermetic wisdom to them while they were asleep. Having
been instructed, the candidate was bound to secrecy not only concerning
the chemical formulæ which had been disclosed to him but also concerning
the method by which he had secured them. While these nameless adepts
were suspected of being ''Brothers of the Rose Cross," it could never be
proved who they were, and those visited could only conjecture.

Many suspect the Rosicrucian rose to be a conventionalization of the
Egyptian and Hindu lotus blossom, with the same symbolic meaning as this
more ancient symbol. The *Divine Comedy* stamps Dante Alighieri as being
familiar with the theory of Rosicrucianism. Concerning this point,
Albert Pike in his *Morals and Dogma* makes this significant statement:
"His Hell is but a negative Purgatory. His heaven is composed of a
series of Kabalistic circles, divided by a cross, like the Pantacle of
Ezekiel. In the center of this cross blooms a rose, and we see the
symbol of the Adepts of the Rose-Croix for the first time publicly
expounded and almost categorically explained."

Doubt has always existed as to whether the name Rosicrucian came from
the symbol of the rose and cross, or whether this was merely a blind to
deceive the uninformed and further conceal the true meaning of the
Order. Godfrey Higgins believes that the word *Rosicrucian* is not
derived from the flower but from the word *Ros*, which means dew. It is
also interesting to note that the word *Ras* means wisdom, while *Rus*
is translated concealment. Doubtless all of these meanings have
contributed to Rosicrucian symbolism.

A. E. Waite holds with Godfrey Higgins that the process of forming the
Philosopher's Stone with the aid of dew is the secret concealed within
the name Rosicrucian. It is possible that the dew referred to is a
mysterious substance within the human brain, closely resembling the
description given by alchemists of the dew which, falling from heaven,
redeemed the earth. The cross is symbolic of the human body, and the two
symbols together--the rose on the cross--signify that the soul of man is
crucified upon the body, where it is held by three nails.

It is probable that Rosicrucian symbolism is a perpetuation of the
secret tenets of the Egyptian Hermes, and that the Society of Unknown
Philosophers is the true link connecting modern Masonry, with its mass
of symbols, to ancient Egyptian Hermeticism, the source of that
symbolism. In his *Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah*, A. E. Waite
makes this important observation: "There are certain indications which
point to a possible connection between Masonry and Rosicrucianism, and
this, if admitted, would constitute the first link in its connection
with the past. The evidence is, however, inconclusive, or at least
unextricated. Freemasonry per se, in spite of the affinity with
mysticism which I have just mentioned, has never exhibited any mystic
character, nor has it a clear notion how it came by its symbols."

Many of those connected with the development of Freemasonry were
suspected of being Rosicrucians; some, as in the case of Robert Fludd,
even wrote defenses of this organization. Frank C. Higgins, a modern
Masonic symbolist, writes: "Doctor Ashmole, a member of this fraternity
\[Rosicrucian\], is revered by Masons as one of the founders of the
first Grand Lodge in London." (See *Ancient Freemasonry*.) Elias Ashmole
is but one of many intellectual links connecting Rosicrucianism with the
genesis of Freemasonry. The *Encyclopædia Britannica* notes that Elias
Ashmole was initiated into the Freemasonic Order in 1646, and further
states that he was "the first gentleman, or amateur, to be 'accepted'."

On this same subject, Papus, in his *Tarot of the Bohemians*, has
written: "We must not forger that the Rosicrucians were the Initiators
of Leibnitz, and the founders of actual Freemasonry through Ashmole." If
the founders of Freemasonry were initiated into the Great Arcanum of
Egypt--and the symbolism of modern Masonry would indicate that such was
the case--then it is reasonable to suppose that they secured their
information from a society whose existence they admitted and which was
duly qualified to teach them these symbols and allegories.

One theory concerning the two Orders is to the effect that Freemasonry
was an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism; in other words, that the "Unknown
Philosophers" became known through an organization which they created to
serve them in the material world. The story goes on to relate that the
Rosicrucian adepts became dissatisfied with their progeny and silently
withdrew from the Masonic hierarchy, leaving behind their symbolism and
allegories, but carrying away the keys by which the locked symbols could
be made to give tip their secret meanings. Speculators have gone so far
as to state that, in their opinion, modern Freemasonry has completely
absorbed Rosicrucianism and succeeded it as the world's greatest secret
society. Other minds of equal learning declare that the Rosicrucian
Brotherhood still exists, preserving its individuality as the result of
having withdrawn from the Masonic Order.

According to a widely accepted tradition, the headquarters of the
Rosicrucian Order is near Carlsbad, in Austria (see Doctor Franz
Hartmann). Another version has it that a mysterious school, resembling
in general principles the Rosicrucian Fraternity, which calls itself
"The Bohemian Brothers," still maintains its individuality in the
*Schwarzwald* (Black Forest) of Germany. One thing is certain: with the
rise of Freemasonry, the Rosicrucian Order in Europe practically
disappeared, and notwithstanding existing statements to the contrary, it
is certain that the 18th degree (commonly known as the Rose-Croix)
perpetuates many of the symbols of the Rosicrucian Fire Alchemists.

In an anonymous unpublished manuscript of the eighteenth century bearing
the earmarks of Rosicrucian Qabbalism appears this

<span id="img_13900"></span>

[![THE ROSICRUCIAN ROSE.](tn/13900.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/13900.jpg.md)  
THE ROSICRUCIAN ROSE.  

From *Geheime Figuren der Rosenkreuzer*.

The rose is a yonic symbol associated with generation, fecundity, and
purity. The fact that flowers blossom by unfolding has caused them to be
chosen as symbolic of spiritual unfoldment. The red color of the rose
refers to the blood of Christ, and the golden heart concealed within the
midst of the flower corresponds to the spiritual gold concealed within
the human nature. The number of its petals being ten is also a subtle
reminder of the perfect Pythagorean number. The rose symbolizes the
heart, and the heart has always been accepted by Christians as
emblematic of the virtues of love and compassion, as well as of the
nature of Christ--the personification of these virtues. The rose as a
religious emblem is of great antiquity. It was accepted by the Greeks as
the symbol of the sunrise, or of the coming of dawn. In his
Metamorphosis, or Golden Ass, Apuleius, turned into a donkey because of
his foolishness, regained his human shape by eating a sacred rose given
to him by the Egyptian priests.

The presence of a hieroglyphic rose upon the escutcheon of Martin Luther
has been the basis of much speculation as to whether any connection
existed between his Reformation and the secret activities of the Rose
Cross.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

statement: "Yet will I now give the over-wise world a paradox to be
solved, namely, that some illuminated men have undertaken to found
Schools of Wisdom in Europe and these for some peculiar reason have
called themselves *Fratres Rosa: Crucis*. But soon afterwards came false
schools into existence and corrupted the good intentions of these wise
men. Therefore, the Order no longer exists as most people would
understand existence, and as this Fraternity of the *Seculo Fili* call
themselves *Brothers of the Rosie Cross*, so also will they in the
*Seculo Spiritus Sancti* call themselves *Brothers of the Lily Cross*
and the *Knights of the White Lion*. Then will the Schools of Wisdom
begin again to blossom, but why the first one chose their name and why
the others shall also choose theirs, only those can solve who have
understanding grounded in Nature."

Political aspirations of the Rosicrucians were expressed through the
activities of Sir Francis Bacon, the Comte de St.-Germain, and the Comte
di Cagliostro. The last named is suspected of having been an emissary of
the Knights Templars, a society deeply involved in transcendentalism, as
Eliphas Levi has noted. There is a popular supposition to the effect
that the Rosicrucians were at least partial instigators of the French
Revolution. (Note particularly the introduction to Lord Bulwer-Lytton's
Rosicrucian novel *Zanoni*.)

### THE THIRD POSTULATE

The third theory takes the form of a sweeping denial of Rosicrucianism,
asserting that the so-called original Order never had any foundation in
fact but was entirely a product of imagination. This viewpoint is best
expressed by a number of questions which are still being asked by
investigators of this elusive group of metaphysicians. Was the
"Brotherhood of the Rose Cross" merely a mythical institution created in
the fertile mind of some literary cynic for the purpose of deriding the
alchemical and Hermetic sciences? Did the "House of the Holy Spirit"
ever exist outside the imagination of some mediæval mystic? Was the
whole Rosicrucian story a satire to ridicule the gullibility of
scholastic Europe? Was the mysterious Father C.R.C. a product of the
literary genius of Johann Valentin Andreæ, or another of similar mind,
who, attempting to score alchemical and Hermetic philosophy, unwittingly
became a great power in furthering the cause of its promulgation? That
at least one of the early documents of the Rosicrucians was from the pen
of Andreæ there is little doubt, but for just what purpose he compiled
it still remains a matter of speculation. Did Andreæ himself receive
from some unknown person, or persons, instructions to be carried out? If
he wrote the *Chymical Nuptials of Christian Rosencreut*z when only
fifteen years old, was he overshadowed in the preparation of that book?

To these vital questions no answers are forthcoming. A number of persons
accepted the magnificent imposture of Andreæ as absolute truth. It is
maintained by many that, as a consequence, numerous
[pseudo](errata.htm#11.md)-societies sprang up, each asserting that it was
the organization concerning which the *Fama Fraternitatis* and the
*Confessio Fraternitatis* were written. Beyond doubt there are many
spurious orders in existence today; but few of them can offer valid
claims that their history dates back farther than the beginning of the
nineteenth century.

The mystery associated with the Rosicrucian Fraternity has resulted in
endless controversy. Many able minds, notable among them Eugenius
Philalethes, Michael Maier, John Heydon, and Robert Fludd, defended the
concrete existence of "The Society of Unknown Philosophers." Others
equally qualified have asserted it to be of fraudulent origin and
doubtful existence. Eugenius Philalethes, while dedicating books to the
Order, and himself writing an extended exposition of its principles,
disclaims all personal connection with it. Many others have done
likewise.

Some are of the opinion that Sir Francis Bacon had a hand in the writing
of the *Fama* and *Confessio Fraternitatis*, on the basis that the
rhetorical style of these works is similar to that of Bacon's *New
Atlantis*. They also contend that certain statements in the latter work
point to an acquaintance with Rosicrucian symbology. The elusiveness of
the Rosicrucians has caused them to be favorite subject's for literary
works. Outstanding among the romances which have been woven around them
is *Zanoni*. The author, Lord Bulwer-Lytton, is regarded by some as a
member of the Order, while others assert that he applied for membership
but was rejected. Pope's *Rape of the Lock*, &c. *Comte de Gabalis* by
Abbé de Villars, and essays by De Quincy, Hartmann, Jennings, Mackenzie,
and others, are examples of Rosicrucian literature. Although the
existence of these mediæval Rosicrucians is difficult to prove,
sufficient evidence is at hand to make it extremely probable that there
existed in Germany, and afterwards in France, Italy, England, and other
European countries, a secret society of illuminated savants who made
contributions of great import to the sum of human knowledge, while
maintaining absolute secrecy concerning their personalities and their
organization.

### THE FOURTH POSTULATE

The apparent incongruities of the Rosicrucian controversy have also been
accounted for by a purely transcendental explanation. There is evidence
that early writers were acquainted with such a supposition--which,
however, was popularized only after it had been espoused by Theosophy.
This theory asserts that the Rosicrucians actually possessed all the
supernatural powers with which they were credited; that they were in
reality citizens of two worlds: that, while they had physical bodies for
expression on the material plane, they were also capable, through the
instructions they received from the Brotherhood, of functioning in a
mysterious ethereal body not subject to the limitations of time or
distance. By means of this "astral form" they were able to function in
the invisible realm of Nature, and in this realm, beyond reach of the
profane, their temple was located.

According to this viewpoint, the true Rosicrucian Brotherhood consisted
of a limited number of highly developed adepts, or initiates, those of
the higher degrees being no longer subject to the laws of mortality;
candidates were accepted into the Order only after long periods of
probation; adepts possessed the secret of the Philosopher's Stone and
knew the process of transmuting the base metals into gold, but taught
that these were only allegorical terms concealing the true mystery of
human regeneration through the transmutation of the "base elements" of
man's lower nature into the "gold" of intellectual and spiritual
realization. According to this theory, those who have sought to record
the events of importance in connection with the Rosicrucian controversy
have invariably failed because they approached their subject from a
purely physical or materialistic angle.

These adepts were believed to have been able to teach man how to
function away from his physical body at will by assisting him to remove
the "rose from the cross." They taught that the spiritual nature was
attached to the material form at certain points, symbolized by the
"nails" of the crucifixion; but by three alchemical initiations which
took place in the spiritual world, in the true Temple of the Rose Cross,
they were able to "draw" these nails and permit the divine nature of man
to come down from its cross. They concealed the processes by which this
was accomplished under three alchemical metaphoric expressions: "The
Casting of the Molten Sea," "The Making of the Rose Diamond," and "The
Achieving of the Philosopher's Stone."

While the intellectualist flounders among contradictory theories, the
mystic treats the problem in an entirely different manner. He believes
that the true Rosicrucian Fraternity, consisting of a school of supermen
(not unlike the fabled Mahatmas of India), is an institution existing
not in the visible world bur in its spiritual counterpart, which he sees
fit to call the "inner planes of Nature"; that the Brothers can be
reached only by those who are capable of transcending the limitations of
the material world. To substantiate their viewpoint, these mystics cite
the following significant statement from the *Confessio Fraternitatis*:
"A thousand times the unworthy may clamour, a thousand times may present
themselves, yet God hath commanded our ears that they should hear none
of them, and hath so compassed us about with His clouds that unto us,
His servants, no violence can be done; wherefore now no longer are we
beheld by human eyes, unless they have received strength borrowed from
the eagle." In mysticism the eagle is a symbol of initiation (the spinal
Spirit Fire), and by this is explained the inability of the
unregenerated world to understand the Secret Order of the Rose Cross.

Those professing this theory regard the Comte de St.-Germain as their
highest adept and assert that he and Christian Rosencreutz were one and
the same individual. They accept fire as their universal symbol because
it was the one element by means of which they could control the metals.
They declared themselves the descendants of Tubal-cain and Hiram Abiff,
and that the purpose of their existence was to preserve the spiritual
nature of man through ages of materiality. "The Gnostic sects, the
Arabs, Alchemists, Templars, Rosicrucians, and lastly the Freemasons,
form the Western chain in the transmission of occult science." (See *The
Tarot of the Bohemians* translated by A. E. Waite from the French of
Papus.)

Max Heindel, the Christian mystic, described the Rosicrucian Temple as
an "etheric structure" located in and around the home of a European
country gentleman. He believed that this invisible building would
ultimately be moved to the American continent. Mr. Heindel referred to
the Rosicrucian Initiates as so advanced in the science of life that
"death had forgotten them."

The reference to four red roses and a white cross in the Chymical
Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz identified Johann Valentin Andreæ as
its author, for his family crest, shown above, consisted of four red
roses and a white cross.
