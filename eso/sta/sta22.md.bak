# Flowers, Plants, Fruits, and Trees

THE yoni and phallus were worshiped by nearly all ancient peoples as
appropriate symbols of God's creative power. The Garden of Eden, the
Ark, the Gate of the Temple, the Veil of the Mysteries, the *vesica
piscis* or oval nimbus, and the Holy Grail are important yonic symbols;
the pyramid, the obelisk, the cone, the candle, the tower, the Celtic
monolith, the spire, the campanile, the Maypole, and the Sacred Spear
are symbolic of the phallus. In treating the subject of Priapic worship,
too many modern authors judge pagan standards by their own and wallow in
the mire of self-created vulgarity. The Eleusinian Mysteries--the
greatest of all the ancient secret societies--established one of the
highest known standards of morality and ethics, and those criticizing
their use of phallic symbols should ponder the trenchant words of King
Edward III, "*Honi soit qui mal y pense*."

The obscene rites practiced by the later Bacchanalia and Dionysia were
no more representative of the standards of purity originally upheld by
the Mysteries than the orgies occasionally occurring among the adherents
of Christianity till the eighteenth century were representative of
primitive Christianity. Sir William Hamilton, British Minister at the
Court of Naples, declares that in 1780, Isernia, a community of
Christians in Italy, worshiped with phallic ceremonies the pagan god
Priapus under the name of St. Cosmo. (See *Two Essays on the Worship of
Priapus*, by Richard Payne Knight.)

Father, mother, and child constitute the natural trinity. The Mysteries
glorified the home as the supreme institution consisting of this trinity
functioning as a unit. Pythagoras likened the universe to the family,
declaring that as the supreme fire of the universe was in the midst of
its heavenly bodies, so, by analogy, the supreme fire of the world was
upon its hearthstones. The Pythagorean and other schools of philosophy
conceived the one divine nature of God to manifest itself in the
threefold aspect of Father, Mother, and Child. These three constituted
the Divine Family, whose dwelling place is creation and whose natural
and peculiar symbol is the 47th problem of Euclid. God the Father is
spirit, God the Mother is matter, and God the Child--the product of the
two--represents the sum of living things born out of and constituting
Nature. The seed of spirit is sown in the womb of matter, and by an
immaculate (pure) conception the progeny is brought into being. Is not
this the true mystery of the Madonna holding the Holy Babe in her arms?
Who dares to say that such symbolism is improper? The mystery of life is
the supreme mystery, revealed in all of its divine dignity and glorified
as Nature's per feet achievement by the initiated sages and seers of all
ages.

The prudery of today, however, declares this same mystery to be unfit
for the consideration of holy-minded people. Contrary to the dictates of
reason, a standard has been established which affirms that innocence
bred of ignorance is more to be desired than virtue born of knowledge.
Eventually, however, man will learn that he need never be ashamed of
truth. Until he does learn this, he is false to his God, to his world,
and to himself. In this respect, Christianity has woefully failed in its
mission. While declaring man's body to be the living temple of the
living God, in the same breath it asserts the substances and functions
of this temple to be unclean and their study defiling to the sensitive
sentiments of the righteous. By this unwholesome attitude, man's
body--the house of God--is degraded and defamed. Yet the cross itself is
the oldest of phallic emblems, and the lozenge-shaped windows of
cathedrals are proof that yonic symbols have survived the destruction of
the pagan Mysteries. The very structure of the church itself is
permeated with phallicism. Remove from the Christian Church all emblems
of Priapic origin and nothing is left, for even the earth upon which it
stands was, because of its fertility, the first yonic symbol. As the
presence of these emblems of the generative processes is either unknown
or unheeded by the majority, the irony of the situation is not generally
appreciated. Only those conversant with the secret language of antiquity
are capable of understanding the divine significance of these emblems.

Flowers were chosen as symbols for many reasons. The great variety of
flora made it possible to find some plant or flower which would be a
suitable figure for nearly any abstract quality or condition. A plant
might be chosen because of some myth connected with its origin, as the
stories of Daphne and Narcissus; because of the peculiar environment in
which it thrived, as the orchid and the fungus; because of its
significant shape, as the passion flower and the Easter lily; because of
its brilliance or fragrance, as the verbena and the sweet lavender;
because it preserved its form indefinitely, as the everlasting flower;
because of unusual characteristics as the sunflower and heliotrope,
which have long been sacred because of their affinity for the sun.

The plant might also be considered worthy of veneration because from its
crushed leaves, petals, stalks, or roots could be extracted healing
unctions, essences, or drugs affecting the nature and intelligence of
human beings--such as the poppy and the ancient herbs of prophecy. The
plant might also be regarded as efficacious in the cure of many diseases
because its fruit, leaves, petals, or roots bore a resemblance in shape
or color to parts or organs of the human body. For example, the
distilled juices of certain species of ferns, also the hairy moss
growing upon oaks, and the thistledown were said to have the power of
growing hair; the *dentaria*, which resembles a tooth in shape, was said
to cure the toothache; and the *palma Christi* plant, because of its
shape, cured all afflictions of the hands.

The blossom is really the reproductive system of the plant and is
therefore singularly appropriate as a symbol of sexual purity--an
absolute requisite of the ancient Mysteries. Thus the flower signifies
this ideal of beauty and regeneration which must ultimately take the
place of lust and degeneracy.

Of all symbolic flowers the locus blossom of India and Egypt and the
rose of the Rosicrucians are the most important. In their symbolism
these two flowers are considered identical. The esoteric doctrines for
which the Eastern lotus stands have been perpetuated in modern Europe
under the form of the rose. The rose and the lotus are yonic emblems,
signifying primarily the maternal creative mystery, while the Easter
lily is considered to be phallic.

The Brahmin and Egyptian initiates, who undoubtedly understood the
secret systems of spiritual culture whereby the latent centers of cosmic
energy in man may be stimulated, employed the lotus blossoms to
represent the spinning vortices of spiritual energy located at various
points along the spinal column and called *chakras*, or whirling wheels,
by the Hindus. Seven of these *chakras* are of prime importance and have
their individual correspondences in the nerve ganglia and plexuses.
According to the secret schools, the sacral ganglion is called the
four-petaled lotus; the prostatic plexus, the six-petaled lotus; the
epigastric plexus and navel, the ten-petaled lotus; the cardiac plexus,
the twelve-petaled lotus; the pharyngeal plexus, the sixteen-petaled
locus; the cavernous plexus, the two-petaled lotus; and the pineal gland
or adjacent unknown center, the thousand-petaled locus. The color, size,
and number of petals upon the

THE TREE OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.  

This remarkable example of the use of the tree in symbolism is from the
Chateau de Pierrefonds in the little town of Pierrefonds, northern
France. The eight side branches end in conventional cup-like flowers,
from each of which rises the body of a knight carrying in his hand a
ribbon bearing his name. The central stem is surmounted by a larger
flower, from which emerges the body of King Arthur himself. The tree is
a favorite motif in heraldry. The one trunk with its multitude of
branches caused the tree to be frequently used in diagramming family
lineage, from which practice has arisen the custom of terming such
tables "family trees."

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

lotus are the keys to its symbolic import. A hint concerning the
unfoldment of spiritual understanding according to the secret science of
the Mysteries is found in the story of Aaron's rod that budded, and also
in Wagner's great opera, *Tannhäuser*, where the budding staff of the
Pope signifies the unfolding blossoms upon the sacred rod of the
Mysteries--the spinal column.

The Rosicrucians used a garland of roses to signify the same spiritual
vortices, which are referred to in the Bible as the seven lamps of the
candlestick and the seven churches of Asia. In the 1642 edition of Sir
Francis Bacon's *History of Henry the Seventh* is a frontispiece showing
Lord Bacon with Rosicrucian roses for shoe buckles.

In the Hindu system of philosophy, each petal of the lotus bears a
certain symbol which gives an added clue to the meaning of the flower.
The Orientals also used the lotus plant to signify the growth of man
through the three periods of human consciousness--ignorance, endeavor,
and understanding. As the lotus exists in three elements (earth, water,
and air) so man lives in three worlds--material, intellectual, and
spiritual. As the plant, with its roots in the mud and the slime, grows
upward through the water and finally blossoms forth in the light and
air, so the spiritual growth of man is upward from the darkness of base
action and desire into the light of truth and understanding, the water
serving as a symbol of the ever-changing world of illusion through which
the soul must pass in its struggle to reach the state of spiritual
illumination. The rose and its Eastern equivalent, the lotus, like all
beautiful flowers, represent spiritual unfoldment and attainment: hence,
the Eastern deities are often shown seated upon the open petals of the
lotus blossoms.

The lotus was also a universal motif in Egyptian art and architecture.
The roofs of many temples were upheld by lotus columns, signifying the
eternal wisdom; and the lotus-headed scepter--symbolic of
self-unfoldment and divine prerogative--was often carried in religious
processions. When the flower had nine petals, it was symbolic of man;
when twelve, of the universe and the gods; when seven, of the planets
and the law; when five, of the senses and the Mysteries; and when three,
of the chief deities and the worlds. The heraldic rose of the Middle
Ages generally has either five or ten petals thereby showing its
relationship to the spiritual mystery of man through the Pythagorean
pentad and decad.

### CULTUS ARBORUM

The worship of trees as proxies of Divinity was prevalent throughout the
ancient world. Temples were often built in the heart of sacred groves,
and nocturnal ceremonials were conducted under the wide-spreading
branches of great trees, fantastically decorated and festooned in honor
of their patron deities. In many instances the trees themselves were
believed to possess the attributes of divine power and intelligence, and
therefore supplications were often addressed to them. The beauty,
dignity, massiveness, and strength of oaks, elms, and cedars led to
their adoption as symbols of power, integrity, permanence, virility, and
divine protection.

Several ancient peoples--notably the Hindus and Scandinavians---regarded
the Macrocosm, or Grand Universe, as a divine tree growing from a single
seed sown in space. The Greeks, Persians, Chaldeans, and Japanese have
legends describing the axle tree or reed upon which the earth revolves.
Kapila declares the universe to be the eternal tree, Brahma, which
springs from an imperceptible and intangible seed--the material monad.
The mediæval Qabbalists represented creation as a tree with its roots in
the reality of spirit and its branches in the illusion of tangible
existence. The Sephirothic tree of the Qabbalah was therefore inverted,
with its roots in heaven and its branches upon the earth. Madam
Blavatsky notes that the Great Pyramid was considered to be a symbol of
this inverted tree, with its root at the apex of the pyramid and its
branches diverging in four streams towards the base.

The Scandinavian world-tree, Yggdrasil, supports on its branches nine
spheres or worlds,--which the Egyptians symbolized by the nine stamens
of the persea or avocado. All of these are enclosed within the
mysterious tenth sphere or cosmic egg--the definitionless Cipher of the
Mysteries. The Qabbalistic tree of the Jews also consists of nine
branches, or worlds, emanating from the First Cause or Crown, which
surrounds its emanations as the shell surrounds the egg. The single
source of life and the endless diversity of its expression has a perfect
analogy in the structure of the tree. The trunk represents the single
origin of all diversity; the roots, deeply imbedded in the dark earth,
are symbolic of divine nutriment; and its multiplicity of branches
spreading from the central trunk represent the infinity of universal
effects dependent upon a single cause.

The tree has also been accepted as symbolic of the Microcosm, that is,
man. According to the esoteric doctrine, man first exists potentially
within the body of the world-tree and later blossoms forth into
objective manifestation upon its branches. According to an early Greek
Mystery myth, the god Zeus fabricated the third race of men from ash
trees. The serpent so often shown wound around the trunk of the tree
usually signifies the mind--the power of thought--and is the eternal
tempter or urge which leads all rational creatures to the ultimate
discovery of reality and thus overthrows the rule of the gods. The
serpent hidden in the foliage of the universal tree represents the
cosmic mind; and in the human tree, the individualized intellect.

The concept that all life originates from seeds caused grain and various
plants to be accepted as emblematic of the human spermatozoon, and the
tree was therefore symbolic of organized life unfolding from its
primitive germ. The growth of the universe from its primitive seed may
be likened to the growth of the mighty oak from the tiny acorn. While
the tree is apparently much greater than its own source, nevertheless
that source contains potentially every branch, twig, and leaf which will
later be objectively unfolded by the processes of growth.

Man's veneration for trees as symbols of the abstract qualities of
wisdom and integrity also led him to designate as trees those
individuals who possessed these divine qualities to an apparently
superhuman degree. Highly illumined philosophers and priests were
therefore often referred to as *trees* or *tree men*--for example, the
Druids, whose name, according to one interpretation, signifies *the men
of the oak trees*, or the initiates of certain Syrian Mysteries who were
called *cedars*; in fact it is far more credible and probable that the
famous *cedars of Lebanon*, cut down for the building of King Solomon's
Temple, were really illumined, initiated sages. The mystic knows that
the true supports of God's Glorious House were not the logs subject to
decay but the immortal and imperishable intellects of the tree
hierophants.

Trees are repeatedly mentioned in the Old and New Testaments, and in the
scriptures of various pagan nations. The Tree of Life and the Tree of
the Knowledge of Good and Evil mentioned in Genesis, the burning bush in
which the angel appeared to Moses, the famous vine and fig tree of the
New Testament, the grove of olives in the Garden of Gethsemane where
Jesus went to pray, and the miraculous tree of Revelation, which bore
twelve manners of fruit and whose leaves were for the healing of the
nations, all bear witness to the esteem in which trees were held by the
scribes of Holy Writ. Buddha received his illumination while under the
*bodhi* tree, near Madras in India, and several of the Eastern gods are
pictured sitting in meditation beneath the spreading branches of mighty
trees. Many of the great sages and saviors carried wands, rods, or
staves cut from the wood of sacred trees, as the rods of Moses and
Aaron; Gungnir--the spear of Odin--cut from the Tree of Life; and the
consecrated rod of Hermes, around which the fighting serpents entwined
themselves.

The numerous uses which the ancients made of the tree and its products
are factors in its symbolism. Its worship was, to a certain degree,
based upon its usefulness. Of this J. P. Lundy writes: "Trees occupy
such an important place in the economy of nature by way of attracting
and retaining moisture, and shading the water-sources and the soil so as
to prevent barrenness and desolation; the), are so

THE TREE OF NOAH.  

From the "*Breeches*" *Bible of 1599*.

Most Bibles published during the Middle Ages contain a section devoted
to genealogical tables showing the descent of humanity from Father Adam
to the advent of Jesus Christ. The tree growing from the roof of the Ark
represents the body of Noah and its three branches, his sons--Shem, Ham,
and Japheth. The nations by the descendents of Noah's three sons are
appropriately shown in the circles upon the branches of the tree. While
such tables are hopelessly incorrect from a historical point of view, to
the symbolist their allegorical interpretations are of inestimable
importance.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

useful to man for shade, for fruit, for medicine, for fuel, for building
houses and ships, for furniture, for almost every department of life,
that it is no wonder that some of the more conspicuous ones, such as the
oak, the pine, the palm, and the sycamore, have been made sacred and
used for worship." (See *Monumental Christianity*.)

The early Fathers of the church sometimes used the tree to symbolize
Christ. They believed that ultimately Christianity would grow up like a
mighty oak and overshadow all other faiths of mankind. Because it
annually discards its foliage, the tree was also looked upon as an
appropriate emblem of resurrection and reincarnation, for though
apparently dying each fall it blossomed forth again with renewed verdure
each ensuing spring.

Under the appellations of the *Tree of Life* and the *Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil* is concealed the great arcanum of
antiquity--the mystery of *equilibrium*. The *Tree of Life* represents
the spiritual point of balance--the secret of immortality. The *Tree of
the Knowledge of Good and Evil*, as its name implies, represents
polarity, or unbalance--the secret of mortality. The Qabbalists reveal
this by assigning the central column of their Sephirothic diagram to the
*Tree of Life* and the two side branches to the *Tree of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil*. "Unbalanced forces perish in the void," declares the
secret work, and all is made known. The apple represents the knowledge
of the procreative processes, by the awakening of which the material
universe was established. The allegory of Adam and Eve in the Garden of
Eden is a cosmic myth, revealing the methods of universal and individual
establishment. The literal story, accepted for so many centuries by an
unthinking world, is preposterous, but the creative mystery of which it
is the symbol is one of Nature's profoundest verities. The Ophites
(serpent worshipers) revered the Edenic snake because it was the cause
of individual existence. Though humanity is still wandering in a world
of good and evil, it will ultimately attain completion and eat of the
fruit of the Tree of Life growing in the midst of the illusionary garden
of worldly things. Thus the *Tree of Life* is also the appointed symbol
of the Mysteries, and by partaking of its fruit man attains immortality.

The oak, the pine, the ash, the cypress, and the palm are the five trees
of greatest symbolic importance. The Father God of the Mysteries was
often worshiped under the form of an oak; the Savior God--frequently the
World Martyr--in the form of a pine; the world axis and the divine
nature in humanity in the form of an ash; the goddesses, or maternal
principle, in the form of a cypress; and the positive pole of generation
in the form of the inflorescence of the mate date palm. The pine cone is
a phallic symbol of remote antiquity. The thyrsus of Bacchus--a long
wand or staff surmounted by a pine cone or cluster of grapes and
entwined with ivy or grape-vine leaves, sometimes ribbons--signifies
that the wonders of Nature may only be accomplished by the aid of solar
virility, as symbolized by the cone or grapes. In the Phrygian
Mysteries, Atys--the ever-present sun-savior--dies under the branches of
the pine tree (an allusion to the solar globe at the winter solstice)
and for this reason the pine tree was sacred to his cult. This tree was
also sacred in the Mysteries of Dionysos and Apollo.

Among the ancient Egyptians and Jews the acacia, or tamarisk, was held
in the highest religious esteem; and among modern Masons, branches of
acacia, cypress, cedar, or evergreen are still regarded as most
significant emblems. The shittim-wood used by the children of Israel in
the construction of the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant was a
species of acacia. In describing this sacred tree, Albert Pike has
written: "The genuine acacia, also, is the thorny tamarisk, the same
tree which grew around the body of Osiris. It was a sacred tree among
the Arabs, who made of it the idol Al-Uzza, which Mohammed destroyed. It
is abundant as a bush in the desert of Thur; and of it the 'crown of
thorns' was composed, which was set on the forehead of Jesus of
Nazareth. It is a fit type of immortality on account of its tenacity of
life; for it has been known, when planted as a door-post, to take root
again and shoot out budding boughs above the [threshold](errata.htm#6.md)."
(See *Morals and Dogma*.)

It is quite possible that much of the veneration accorded the acacia is
due to the peculiar attributes of the *mimosa*, or sensitive plant, with
which it was often identified by the ancients. There is a Coptic legend
to the effect that the sensitive plant was the first of all trees or
shrubs to worship Christ. The rapid growth of the acacia and its beauty
have also caused it to be regarded as emblematic of fecundity and
generation.

The symbolism of the acacia is susceptible of four distinct
interpretations: (1) it is the emblem of the vernal equinox--the annual
resurrection of the solar deity; (2) under the form of the sensitive
plant which shrinks from human touch, the acacia signifies purity and
innocence, as one of the Greek meanings of its name implies; (3) it
fittingly typifies human immortality and regeneration, and under the
form of the evergreen represents that immortal part of man which
survives the destruction of his visible nature; (4) it is the ancient
and revered emblem of the Mysteries, and candidates entering the
tortuous passageways in which the ceremonials were given carried in
their hands branches of these sacred plants or small clusters of
sanctified flowers.

Albert G. Mackey calls attention to the fact that each of the ancient
Mysteries had its own peculiar plant sacred to the gods or goddesses in
whose honor the rituals were celebrated. These sacred plants were later
adopted as the symbols of the various degrees in which they were used.
Thus, in the Mysteries of Adonis, lettuce was sacred; in the Brahmin and
Egyptian rites, the lotus; among the Druids, the mistletoe; and among
certain of the Greek Mysteries, the myrtle. (See *Encyclopædia of
Freemasonry*.)

As the legend of CHiram Abiff is based upon the ancient Egyptian Mystery
ritual of the murder and resurrection of Osiris, it is natural that the
sprig of acacia should be preserved as symbolic of the resurrection of
CHiram. The chest containing the body of Osiris was washed ashore near
Byblos and lodged in the roots of a tamarisk, or acacia, which, growing
into a mighty tree, enclosed within its trunk the body of the murdered
god. This is undoubtedly the origin of the story that a sprig of acacia
marks the grave of CHiram. The mystery of the evergreen marking the
grave of the dead sun god is also perpetuated in the Christmas tree.

The apricot and quince are familiar yonic symbols, while the bunch of
grapes and the fig are phallic. The pomegranate is the mystic fruit of
the Eleusinian rites; by eating it, Prosperine bound herself to the
realms of Pluto. The fruit here signifies the sensuous life which, once
tasted, temporarily deprives man of immortality. Also on account of its
vast number of seeds the pomegranate was often employed to represent
natural fecundity. For the same reason, Jacob Bryant in his *Ancient
Mythology* notes that the ancients recognized in this fruit an
appropriate emblem of the Ark of the Deluge,

<span id="img_09500"></span>

[![THE SUNFLOWER.](tn/09500.jpg)

THE SUNFLOWER.  

From Kircher's *Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica Opus Tripartitum*.

The above diagram illustrates a curious experiment in plant magnetism
reproduced with several other experiments in Athanasius Kircher's rare
volume on magnetism. Several plants were sacred to the ancient
Egyptians, Greeks, and Hindus because of the peculiar effect which the
sun exerted over them. As it is difficult for man to look upon the face
of the sun without being blinded by the light, those plants which turned
and deliberately faced the solar orb were considered typical of very
highly advanced souls. Since the sun was regarded as the personification
of the Supreme Deity, those forms of life over which it exercised marked
influence were venerated as being sacred to Divinity. The sunflower,
because of its plainly perceptible affinity for the sun, was given high
rank among sacred plants.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

which contained the seeds of the new human race. Among the ancient
Mysteries the pomegranate was also considered to be a divine symbol of
such peculiar significance that its true explanation could not be
divulged. It was termed by the Cabiri "the forbidden secret." Many Greek
gods and goddesses are depicted holding the fruit or flower of the
pomegranate in their hands, evidently to signify that they are givers of
life and plenty. Pomegranate capitals were placed upon the pillars of
Jachin and Boaz standing in front of King Solomon's Temple; and by the
order of Jehovah, pomegranate blossoms were embroidered upon the bottom
of the High Priest's ephod.

Strong wine made from the juice of the grape was looked upon as symbolic
of the false life and false light of the universe, for it was produced
by a false process--artificial fermentation. The rational faculties are
clouded by strong drink, and the animal nature, liberated from bondage,
controls the individual--facts which necessarily were of the greatest
spiritual significance. As the lower nature is the eternal tempter
seeking co lead man into excesses which inhibit the spiritual faculties,
the grape and its product were used to symbolize the Adversary.

The juice of the grape was thought by the Egyptians to resemble human
blood more closely than did any other substance. In fact, they believed
that the grape secured its life from the blood of the dead who had been
buried in the earth. According to Plutarch, "The priests of the sun at
Heliopolis never carry any wine into their temples, \* \* \* and if they
made use of it at any time in their libations to the gods, it was not
because they looked upon it as in its own nature acceptable to them; but
they poured it upon their altars as the blood of those enemies who
formerly had fought against them. For they look upon the vine to have
first sprung out of the earth after it was fattened with the carcasses
of those who fell in the wars against the gods. And this, say they, is
the reason why drinking its juice in great quantities makes men mad and
beside themselves, filling them as it were with the blood of their own
ancestors." (See *Isis and Osiris*.)

Among some cults the state of intoxication was viewed as a condition
somewhat akin to ecstasy, for the individual was believed to be
possessed by the Universal Spirit of Life, whose chosen vehicle was the
vine. In the Mysteries, the grape was often used to symbolize lust and
debauchery because of its demoralizing effect upon the emotional nature.
The fact was recognized, however, that fermentation was the certain
evidence of the presence of the solar fire, hence the grape was accepted
as the proper symbol of the Solar Spirit--the giver of divine
enthusiasm. In a somewhat similar manner, Christians have accepted wine
as the emblem of the blood of Christ, partaking of it in Holy Communion.
Christ, the exoteric emblem of the Solar Spirit, said, "I am the vine."
He was therefore worshiped with the wine of ecstasy in the same manner
as were his pagan prototypes--Bacchus, Dionysos, Arys, and Adonis.

The *mandragora officinarum*, or mandrake, is accredited with possessing
the most remarkable magical powers. Its narcotic properties were
recognized by the Greeks, who employed it to deaden pain during surgical
operations, and it has been identified also with *baaras*, the mystic
herb used by the Jews for casting out demons. In the *Jewish Wars*,
Josephus describes the method of securing the *baaras*, which he
declares emits flashes of lightning and destroys all who seek to touch
it, unless they proceed according to certain rules supposedly formulated
by King Solomon himself.

The occult properties of the mandrake, while little understood, have
been responsible for the adoption of the plant as a talisman capable of
increasing the value or quantity of anything with which it was
associated. As a phallic charm, the mandrake was considered to be an
infallible cure for sterility. It was one of the Priapic symbols which
the Knights Templars were accused of worshiping. The root of the plant
closely resembles a human body and often bore the outlines of the human
head, arms, or legs. This striking similarity between the body of man
and the mandragora is one of the puzzles of natural science and is the
real basis for the veneration in which this plant was held. In *Isis
Unveiled*, Madam Blavatsky notes that the mandragora seems to occupy
upon earth the point where the vegetable and animal kingdoms meet, as
the zoophites and polypi do in die sea. This thought opens a vast field
of speculation concerning the nature of this animal-plant.

According to a popular superstition, the mandrake shrank from being
touched and, crying out with a human voice, clung desperately to the
soil in which it was imbedded. Anyone who heard its cry while plucking
it either immediately died or went mad. To circumvent this tragedy, it
was customary to dig around the roots of the mandrake until the plant
was thoroughly loosened and then to tie one end of a cord about the
stalk and fasten the other end to a dog. The dog, obeying his master's
call, thereupon dragged the root from the earth and became the victim of
the mandragora curse. When once uprooted, the plant could be handled
with immunity.

During the Middle Ages, mandrake charms brought great prices and an art
was evolved by which the resemblance between the mandragora root and the
human body was considerably accentuated. Like most superstitions, the
belief in the peculiar powers of the mandrake was founded upon an
ancient secret doctrine concerning the true nature of the plant. "It is
slightly narcotic," says [Eliphas](errata.htm#7.md) Levi, "and an
aphrodisiacal virtue was ascribed to it by the ancients, who represented
it as being sought by Thessalian sorcerers for the composition of
philtres. Is this root the umbilical vestige of our terrestrial origin,
as a certain magical mysticism has suggested? We dare not affirm it
seriously, but it is true all the same that man issued from the slime of
earth and his first appearance must have been in the form of a rough
sketch. The analogies of Nature compel us to admit the notion, at least
as a possibility. The first men were, in this case, a family of
gigantic, sensitive mandrogores, animated by the sun, who rooted
themselves up from the earth." (See *Transcendental Magic*.)

The homely onion was revered by the Egyptians as a symbol of the
universe because its rings and layers represented the concentric planes
into which creation was divided according to the Hermetic Mysteries. It
was also regarded as possessing great medicinal virtue. Because of
peculiar properties resulting from its pungency, the garlic plant was a
powerful agent in transcendental magic. To this day no better medium has
been found for the treatment of obsession. Vampirism and certain forms
of insanity--especially those resulting from mediumship and the
influences of elemental larvæ--respond immediately to the use of garlic.
In the Middle Ages, its presence in a house was believed to ward off all
evil powers.

Trifoliate plants, such as the shamrock, were employed by many religious
cults to represent the principle of the Trinity. St. Patrick is supposed
to have used the shamrock to illustrate this doctrine of the triune
Divinity. The reason for the additional sanctity conferred by a fourth
leaf is that the fourth principle of the Trinity is man, and the
presence of this leaf therefore signifies the redemption of humanity.

Wreaths were worn during initiation into the Mysteries and the reading
of the sacred books to signify that these processes were consecrated to
the deities. On the symbolism of wreaths, Richard Payne Knight writes:
"Instead of beads, wreaths of foliage, generally of laurel, olive,
myrtle, ivy, or oak, appear upon coins, sometimes encircling the
symbolical figures, and sometimes as chaplets upon their heads. All
these were sacred to some peculiar personifications of the deity, and
significant of some particular attributes, and, in general, all
evergreens were Dionysiac planes; that is, symbols of the generative
power, signifying perpetuity of youth and vigor, as the circles of beads
and diadems signify perpetuity of existence. (See *Symbolical Language
of Ancient Art and Mythology*.)

THE TREE OF ALCHEMY.  

From *Musæum Hermeticum Reformatum et Amplificatum*.

The alchemists were went to symbolize their metals by means of a tree,
to indicate that all seven were branches dependent upon the single trunk
of solar life. As the Seven Spirits depend upon God and are branches of
a tree of which He is the root, trunk, and the spiritual earth from
which the root derives its nourishment, so the single trunk of divine
life and power nourishes all the multitudinous forms of which the
universe is composed.

In *Gloria Mundi*, from which the above illustration is reproduced,
there is contained an important thought concerning the plantlike growth
of metals: "All trees, herbs, stones, metals, and minerals grow and
attain to perfection without being necessarily touched by any human
hand: for the seed is raised up from the ground, puts forth flowers, and
bears fruit, simply through the agency of natural influences. As it is
with plants, so it is with metals. While they lie in the heart of the
earth, in their natural ore, they grow and are developed, day by day,
through the influence of the four elements: their fire is the splendor
of the Sun and Moon; the earth conceives in her womb the splendor of the
Sun, and by it the seeds of the metals are well and equally warmed, just
like the grain in the fields. \* \* \* For as each tree of the field has
its own peculiar shape, appearance, and fruit, so each mountain bears
its own particular ore; those stones and that earth being the soil in
which the metals grow." (See Translation of 1893.)
