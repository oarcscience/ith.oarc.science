# CEREMONIAL MAGIC AND SORCERY

CEREMONIAL magic is the ancient art of invoking and controlling spirits
by a scientific application of certain formulæ. A magician, enveloped in
sanctified vestments and carrying a wand inscribed with hieroglyphic
figures, could by the power vested in certain words and symbols control
the invisible inhabitants of the elements and of the astral world. While
the elaborate ceremonial magic of antiquity was not necessarily evil,
there arose from its perversion several false schools of sorcery, or
*black magic*.

Egypt, a great center of learning and the birthplace of many arts and
sciences, furnished an ideal environment for transcendental
experimentation. Here the black magicians of Atlantis continued to
exercise their superhuman powers until they had completely undermined
and corrupted the morals of the primitive Mysteries. By establishing a
sacerdotal caste they usurped the position formerly occupied by the
initiates, and seized the reins of spiritual government. Thus black
magic dictated the state religion and paralyzed the intellectual and
spiritual activities of the individual by demanding his complete and
unhesitating acquiescence in the dogma formulated by the priestcraft.
The Pharaoh became a puppet in the hands of the Scarlet Council--a
committee of arch-sorcerers elevated to power by the priesthood.

These sorcerers then began the systematic destruction of all keys to the
ancient wisdom, so that none might have access to the knowledge
necessary to reach adeptship without first becoming one of their order.
They mutilated the rituals of the Mysteries while professing to preserve
them, so that even though the neophyte passed through the degrees he
could not secure the knowledge to which he was entitled. Idolatry was
introduced by encouraging the worship of the images which in the
beginning the wise had erected solely as symbols for study and
meditation. False interpretations were given to the emblems and figures
of the Mysteries, and elaborate theologies were created to confuse the
minds of their devotees. The masses, deprived of their birthright of
understanding and groveling in ignorance, eventually became the abject
slaves of the spiritual impostors. Superstition universally prevailed
and the black magicians completely dominated national affairs, with the
result that humanity still suffers from the sophistries of the
priestcrafts of Atlantis and Egypt.

Fully convinced that their Scriptures sanctioned it, numerous mediæval
Qabbalists devoted their lives to the practice of ceremonial magic. The
transcendentalism of the Qabbalists is founded upon the ancient and
magical formula of King Solomon, who has long been considered by the
Jews as the prince of ceremonial magicians.

Among the Qabbalists of the Middle Ages were a great number of black
magicians who strayed from the noble concepts of the *Sepher Yetzirah*
and became enmeshed in demonism and witchcraft. They sought to
substitute magic mirrors, consecrated daggers, and circles spread around
posts of coffin nails, for the living of that virtuous life which,
without the assistance of complicated rituals or submundane creatures,
unfailingly brings man to the state of true individual completion.

Those who sought to control elemental spirits through ceremonial magic
did so largely with the hope of securing from the invisible worlds
either rare knowledge or supernatural power. The little red demon of
Napoleon Bonaparte and the infamous oracular heads of de Medici are
examples of the disastrous results of permitting elemental beings to
dictate the course of human procedure. While the learned and godlike
dæmon of Socrates seems to have been an exception, this really proves
that the intellectual and moral status of the magician has much to do
with the type of elemental he is capable of invoking. But even the dæmon
of Socrates deserted the philosopher when the sentence of death was
passed.

Transcendentalism and all forms of phenomenalistic magic are but blind
alleys--outgrowths of Atlantean sorcery; and those who forsake the
straight path of philosophy to wander therein almost invariably fall
victims to their imprudence. Man, incapable of controlling his own
appetites, is not equal to the task of governing the fiery and
tempestuous elemental spirits.

Many a magician has lost his life as the result of opening a way whereby
submundane creatures could become active participants in his affairs.
When Eliphas Levi invoked the spirit of Apollonius of Tyana, what did he
hope to accomplish? Is the gratification of curiosity a motive
sufficient to warrant the devotion of an entire lifetime to a dangerous
and unprofitable pursuit? If the living Apollonius refused to divulge
his secrets to the profane, is there any probability that after death he
would disclose them to the curious-minded? Levi himself did not dare to
assert that the specter which appeared to him was actually the great
philosopher, for Levi realized only too well the proclivity of
elementals to impersonate those who have passed on. The majority of
modern mediumistic apparitions are but elemental creatures masquerading
through bodies composed of thought substance supplied by the very
persons desiring to behold these wraiths of decarnate beings.

### THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF BLACK MAGIC

Some understanding of the intricate theory and practice of ceremonial
magic may be derived from a brief consideration of its underlying
premises.

*First*. The visible universe has an invisible counterpart, the higher
planes of which are peopled by good and beautiful spirits; the lower
planes, dark and foreboding, are the habitation of evil spirits and
demons under the leadership of the Fallen Angel and his ten Princes.

*Second*. By means of the secret processes of ceremonial magic it is
possible to contact these invisible creatures and gain their help in
some human undertaking. Good spirits willingly lend their assistance to
any worthy enterprise, but the evil spirits serve only those who live to
pervert and destroy.

*Third*. It is possible to make contracts with spirits whereby the
magician becomes for a stipulated time the master of an elemental being.

*Fourth*. True black magic is performed with the aid of a demoniacal
spirit, who serves the sorcerer for the length of his earthly life, with
the understanding that after death the magician shall become the servant
of his own demon. For this reason a black magician will go to
inconceivable ends to prolong his physical life, since there is nothing
for him beyond the grave.

The most dangerous form of black magic is the scientific perversion of
occult power for the gratification of personal desire. Its less complex
and more universal form is human selfishness, for selfishness is the
fundamental cause of all worldly evil. A man will barter his eternal
soul for temporal power, and down through the ages a mysterious process
has been evolved which actually enables him to make this exchange. In
its various branches the black art includes nearly all forms of
ceremonial magic, necromancy, witchcraft, sorcery, and vampirism. Under
the same general heading are also included mesmerism and hypnotism,
except when used solely for medical purposes, and even then there is an
element of risk for all concerned.

Though the demonism of the Middle Ages seems to have disappeared, there
is abundant evidence that in many forms of modern thought--especially
the so-called "prosperity" psychology, "willpower-building" metaphysics,
and systems of "high-pressure" salesmanship--

BAPHOMET, THE GOAT OF MENDES.  

From Levi's *Transcendental Magic*.

The practice of magic--either *white* or *black*--depends upon the
ability of the adept to control the universal life force--that which
Eliphas Levi calls the great magical agent or the astral light. By the
manipulation of this fluidic essence the phenomena of transcendentalism
are produced. The famous hermaphroditic Goat of Mendes was a composite
creature formulated to symbolize this *astral light*. It is identical
with Baphomet the mystic pantheos of those disciples of ceremonial
magic, the Templars, who probably obtained it from the Arabians.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

black magic has merely passed through a metamorphosis, and although its
name be changed its nature remains the same.

A well-known magician of the Middle Ages was Dr. Johannes Faustus, more
commonly known as Dr. Faust. By a study of magical writings he was
enabled to bind to his service an elemental who served him for many
years in various capacities. Strange legends are told concerning the
magical powers possessed by Dr. Faust. Upon one occasion the
philosopher, being apparently in a playful mood, threw his mantle over a
number of eggs in a market-woman's basket, causing them to hatch
instantly. At another time, having fallen overboard from a small boat,
he was picked up and returned to the craft with his clothes still dry.
But, like nearly all other magicians, Dr. Faust came at length to
disaster; he was found one morning with a knife in his back, and it was
commonly believed that his familiar spirit had murdered him. Although
Goethe's Dr. Faust is generally regarded as merely a fictional
character, this old magician actually lived during the sixteenth
century. Dr. Faust wrote a book describing his experiences with spirits,
a section of which is reprinted below. (Dr. Faust must not be confused
with Johann Fust, the printer.)

### EXTRACT FROM THE BOOK OF DR. FAUST, WITTENBERG, 1524

(An abridged translation from the original German of a book ordered
destroyed.)

"From my youth I followed art and science and was tireless in my reading
of books. Among those which came to my hand was a volume containing all
kinds of invocations and magical formulæ. In this book I discovered
information to the effect that a spirit, whether he be of the fire, the
water, the earth or the air, can be compelled to do the will of a
magician capable of controlling him. I also discovered that according as
one spirit has more power than another, each is adapted for a different
operation and each is capable of producing certain supernatural effects.

"After reading this wonderful book, I made several experiments, desiring
to rest the accuracy of the statements made therein. At first I had
little faith that what was promised would take place. But at the very
first invocation which I attempted a mighty spirit manifested to me,
desiring to know why I had invoked him. His coming so amazed me that I
scarcely knew what to say, but finally asked him if he would serve me in
my magical investigations. He replied that if certain conditions were
agreed upon he would. The conditions were that I should make a pact with
him. This I did not desire to do, but as in my ignorance I had not
protected myself with a circle and was actually at the mercy of the
spirit, I did not dare to refuse his request and resigned myself to the
inevitable, considering it wisest to turn my mantle according to the
wind.

"I then told him that if he would be serviceable to me according to my
desires and needs for a certain length of time, I would sign myself over
to him. After the pact had been arranged, this mighty spirit, whose name
was *Asteroth*, introduced me to another spirit by the name of
*Marbuel*, who was appointed to be my servant. I questioned *Marbuel* as
to his suitability for my needs. I asked him how quick he was, and he
answered, 'As swift as the winds.' This did not satisfy me, so I
replied, 'You cannot become my servant. Go again whence you have come.'
Soon another spirit manifested itself, whose name was *Aniguel*. Upon
asking him the same question he answered that he was swift as a bird in
the air. I said, 'You are still too slow for me. Go whence you came.' In
the same moment another spirit by the name of *Aciel* manifested
himself. For the third time I asked my question and he answered, 'I am
as swift as human thought.' 'You shall serve me,' I replied. This spirit
was faithful for a long time, but to tell you how he served me is not
possible in a document of this length and I will here only indicate how
spirits are to be invoked and how the circles for protection are to be
prepared. There are many kinds of spirits which will permit themselves
to be invoked by man and become his servant. Of these I will list a few:

"*Aciel*: The mightiest among those who serve men. He manifests in
pleasing human form about three feet high. He must be invoked three
times before he will come forth into the circle prepared for him. He
will furnish riches and will instantly fetch things from a great
distance, according to the will of the magician. He is as swift as human
thought.

"*Aniguel*: Serviceable and most useful, and comes in the form of a
ten-year-old boy. He must be invoked three times. His special power is
to discover treasures and minerals hidden in the ground, which he will
furnish to the magician.

"*Marbuel*: A true lord of the mountains and swift as a bird on the
wing. He is an opposing and troublesome spirit, hard to control. You
must invoke him four times. He appears in the person of Mars \[a warrior
in heavy armor\]. He will furnish the magician those things which grow
above and under the earth. He is particularly the lord of the
*spring-root*. \[The *spring-root* is a mysterious herb, possibly of a
reddish color, which mediæval magicians asserted had the property of
drawing forth or opening anything it touched. If placed against a locked
door, it would open the door. The Hermetists believed that the
red-capped woodpecker was specially endowed with the faculty of
discovering *spring-root*, so they followed this bird to its nest, and
then stopped up the hole in the tree where its young were. The
red-crested woodpecker went at once in quest of the spring-root, and,
discovering it, brought it to the tree. It immediately drew forth the
stopper from the entrance to the nest. The magician then secured the
root from the bird. It was also asserted that because of its structure,
the etheric body of the *spring-root* was utilized as a vehicle of
expression by certain elemental spirits which manifested through the
proclivity of drawing out or opening things.\]

"*Aciebel*: A mighty ruler of the sea, controlling things both upon and
under the water. He furnishes things lost or sunk in rivers, lakes, and
oceans, such as sunken ships and treasures. The more sharply you invoke
him, the swifter he is upon his errands.

"*Machiel*: Comes in the form of a beautiful maiden and by her aid the
magician is raised to honor and dignity. She makes those she serves
worthy and noble, gracious and kindly, and assists in all matters of
litigation and justice. She will not come unless invoked twice.

"*Baruel*: The master of all arts. He manifests as a master workman and
comes wearing an apron. He can teach a magician more in a moment than
all the master workmen of the world combined could accomplish in twenty
years. He must be invoked three times.

"These are the spirits most serviceable to man, but there are numerous
others which, for lack of space, I am unable to describe. Now, if you
desire the aid of the spirit to get this or that, then you must first
draw the sign of the spirit whom you desire to invoke. The drawing must
be made just in front of a circle made before sunrise, in which you and
your assistants will stand. If you desire financial assistance, then you
must invoke the spirit *Aciel*. Draw his sign in front of the circle. If
you need other things, then draw the sign of the spirit capable of
furnishing them. On the place where you intend to make the circle, you
must first draw a great cross with a large sword with which no one ever
has been hurt. Then you must make three concentric circles. The
innermost circle is made of a

A MAGICAL SWORD.  

From Levi's *The Magical Ritual*.

Eliphas Levi describes the preparation of a magical sword in substance
as follows: The steel blade should be forged in the hour of Mars, with
new tools. The pommel should be of hollow silver containing quicksilver,
and the symbols of Mercury and the moon and the signatures of Gabriel
and Samael should be engraved upon it. The hilt should be encased with
tin, with the symbol of Jupiter and the signature of Michael engraved
upon it. A copper triangle should extend from the hilt along the blade a
short distance on each side: these should bear the symbols of Mercury
and Venus. Five Sephiroth should be engraved upon the handle, as shown.
The blade itself should have the word *Malchut* upon one side and *Quis
ut Deus* upon the other. The sword should be consecrated on Sunday.

[![A MAGIC CIRCLE.](tn/10201.jpg)

A MAGIC CIRCLE.  

From *The Complete Book of Magic Science* (unpublished).

The above figure is a complete and faithful representation of a magic
circle as designed by mediæval conjurers for the invocation of spirits.
The magician accompanied by his assistant takes his place at the point
formed by the crossing of the central lines marked *MAGISTER*. The words
about the circle are the names of the invisible intelligences, and the
small crosses mark points at which certain prayers and invocations are
recited. The small circle outside is prepared for the spirit to be
invoked, and while in use has the signature of the desired intelligence
traced within the triangle.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

long narrow strip of virgin parchment and must be hung upon twelve
crosses made of the wood of *cross-thorn*. Upon the parchment you must
write the names and symbols according to the figure which follows.
Outside this first circle make the second as follows:

"First secure a thread of red silk that has been spun or twisted to the
left instead of the right. Then place in the ground twelve crosses made
of laurel leaves, and also prepare a long strip of new white paper.
Write with an unused pen the characters and symbols as seen on the
second circle. Wind this latter strip of paper around with the red
silken thread and pin them upon the twelve crosses of laurel leaves.
Outside this second circle make a third one which is also of virgin
parchment and pinned upon twelve crosses of consecrated palm. When you
have made these three circles, retire into them until at last you stand
in the center upon a pentagram drawn in the midst of the great cross
first drawn. Now, to insure success, do everything according to the
description, and when you have read off the sacred invocation pronounce
the name of the spirit which you desire to appear. It is essential that
you pronounce the name very distinctly. You must also note the day and
the hour, for each spirit can only be invoked at certain times."

While the black magician at the time of signing his pact with the
elemental demon maybe fully convinced that he is strong enough to
control indefinitely the powers placed at his disposal, he is speedily
undeceived. Before many years elapse he must turn all his energies to
the problem of self-preservation. A world of horrors to which he has
attuned himself by his own covetousness looms nearer every day, until he
exists upon the edge of a seething maelstrom, expecting momentarily to
be sucked down into its turbid depths. Afraid to die--because he will
become the servant of his own demon--the magician commits crime after
crime to prolong his wretched earthly existence. Realizing that life is
maintained by the aid of a mysterious universal life force which is the
common property of all creatures, the black magician often becomes an
occult vampire, stealing this energy from others. According to mediæval
superstition, black magicians turned themselves into werewolves and
roamed the earth at night, attacking defenseless victims for the life
force contained in their blood.

### MODUS OPERANDI FOR THE INVOCATION OF SPIRITS

The following condensed extract from an ancient manuscript is reproduced
herewith as representative of the ritualism of ceremonial magic. The
extract is from *The Complete Book of Magic Science*, an unpublished
manuscript (original in the British Museum), with pentacles in colors,
mentioned by Francis Barrett in his *Magus*.

"*Opening Prayer*

"Omnipotent and Eternal God who hath ordained the whole creation for thy
praise and glory and for the salvation of man, I earnestly beseech thee
that thou wouldst send one of thy spirits of the order of Jupiter, one
of the messengers of *Zadkiel* whom thou hast appointed governor of thy
firmament at the present time, most faithfully, willingly, and readily
to show me these things which I shall ask, command or require of him,
and truly execute my desires. Nevertheless, O Most Holy God, thy will
and not mine be done through JC, thine only begotten Son our Lord. Amen.

"*The Invocation*.

\[The magician, having properly consecrated his vestments and utensils
and being protected by his circle, now calls upon the spirits to appear
and accede to his demands.\]

"Spirits, whose assistance I require, behold the sign and the very
Hallowed Names of God full of power. Obey the power of this our
pentacle; go out your hidden caves and dark places; cease your hurtful
occupations to those unhappy mortals whom without ceasing you torment;
come into this place where the Divine Goodness has assembled us; be
attentive to our orders and known to our just demands; believe not that
your resistance will cause us to abandon our operations. Nothing can
dispense with your obeying us. We command you by the Mysterious Names
*Elohe Agla Elohim Adonay Gibort*. Amen.

"I call upon thee, Zadkiel, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost, blessed Trinity, unspeakable Unity.

"I invoke and intreat thee, Zadkiel, in this hour to attend to the words
and conjurations which I shall use this day by the Holy Names of God
*Elohe El Elohim Elion Zebaoth Escerehie Iah Adonay Tetragrammaton*.

"I conjure thee, I exorcise thee, thou Spirit *Zadkiel*, by these Holy
Names *Hagios O Theos Iscyros Athanatos Paracletus Agla on Alpha et
Omega Ioth Aglanbroth Abiel Anathiel Tetragrammaton*: And by all other
great and glorious, holy and unspeakable, mysterious, mighty, powerful,
incomprehensible Names of God, that you attend unto the words of my
mouth, and send unto me *Pabiel* or other of your ministering, serving
Spirits, who may show me such things as I shall demand of him in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

"I intreat thee, *Pabiel*, by the whole Spirit of Heaven, Seraphim,
Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Witnesses, Powers, Principalities,
Archangels, and Angels, by the holy, great, and glorious Angels
*Orphaniel Tetra-Dagiel Salamla Acimoy pastor poti*, that thou come
forthwith, readily show thyself that we may see you and audibly hear
you, speak unto us and fulfil our desires, and by your star which is
Jupiter, and by all the constellations of Heaven, and by whatsoever you
obey, and by your character which you have given, proposed, and
confirmed, that you attend unto me according to the prayer and petitions
which I have made unto Almighty God, and that you forthwith send me one
of your ministering Spirits, who may willingly, truly, and faithfully
fulfil all my desires, and that you command him to appear unto me in the
form of a beautiful Angel, gently, courteously, affably, and meekly,
entering into communication with me, and that he neither permitting any
evil Spirit to approach in any sort of hurt, terrify or affright me in
any way nor deceiving me in any wise. Through the virtue of Our Lord JC,
in whose Name I attend, wait for, and expect thy appearance. Fiat, fiat,
fiat. Amen, Amen, Amen.

"*Interrogatories*.

\[Having summoned the spirit unto his presence, the magician shall
question him as follows:\]

"'Comest thou in peace in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost?' \[And the spirit shall answer:\] 'Yes.'

"'Thou art welcome, noble Spirit. What is thy Name?' \[And the spirit
shall answer:\] '*Pabiel*.'

"'I have called thee in the Name of Jesu of Nazareth at whose Name every
knee doth bow in heaven, earth, and hell, and every tongue shall confess
there is no name like unto the Name of Jesus, who hath given power unto
man to bind and to loose all things in his most Holy Name, yea even unto
those that trust in his salvation.

"'Art thou the messenger of Zadkiel?' \[And the spirit shall answer:\]
'Yes.'

"'Wilt thou confirm thyself unto me at this time and henceforth reveal
all things unto me that I shall desire to know, and teach me how I may
increase in wisdom and knowledge and show unto me all the secrets of the
Magic Art, and of all liberal sciences, that I may thereby set forth the
glory of Almighty God?' \[And the spirit shall answer:\] 'Yes.'

"'Then I pray thee give and confirm thy character unto me whereby I may
call thee at all times, and also swear unto me this oath and I will
religiously keep my vow and covenant unto Almighty God and will
courteously receive thee at all times where thou dost appear unto me.'

"*License to Depart*.

"'Forasmuch as thou comest in peace and quietness and hath answered

[![THE PENTAGRAM.](tn/10300.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/10300.jpg.md)  
THE PENTAGRAM.  

From Levi's *Transcendental Magic*.

THE PENTAGRAM. The pentagram is the figure of the microcosm--the magical
formula of man. It is the one rising out of the four--the human soul
rising from the bondage of the animal nature. It is the true light--the
"Star of the morning." It marks the location of five mysterious centers
of force, the awakening of which is the supreme secret of white magic.

[![FORM OF PACT WITH THE SPIRIT OF JUPITER.](tn/10301.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/10301.jpg.md)  
FORM OF PACT WITH THE SPIRIT OF JUPITER.  

From *The Complete Book of Magic Science*.

The aforesaid Bond of spirits, together with the seal and character of
the planetary angel, must be written m virgin Parchment and laid before
the Spirit \[for signature\] when he appears; at that time the invocant
must not lost confidence but be patient, firm, bold, and Persevering,
and take care that he asks nor requires nothing of the Spirit but with a
view to the glory of God and the well-being fellow creatures. Having
obtained his desires of the Spirit, the invocant may license him to
depart."

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

unto my petitions, I give humble and hearty thanks unto Almighty God in
whose Name I called and thou camest, and now thou mayest depart in peace
unto thine orders and return unto me again at what time soever I shall
call thee by thine oath, or by thy name or by thine order, or by thine
office which is granted thee from the Creator, and the power of God be
with me and thee and upon the whole issue of God, Amen.

"'Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.'

\[Note.\] "It would be advisable for the invocant to remain in the
circle for a few minutes after reciting the license, and if the place of
operation be in the open air, let him destroy all traces of the circle,
etcetera, and return quietly to his home. But should the operation be
performed in a retired part of a house, cc cetera, the circle may
remain, as it might serve in alike future operation, but the room or
building must be locked up to avoid the intrusion of strangers."

The agreement set forth above is purely ceremonial magic. In the case of
black magic, it is the magician and not the demon who must sign the
pact. When the black magician binds an elemental to his service, a
battle of wits ensues, which the demon eventually wins. With his own
blood the magician signs the pact between himself and the demon, for in
the arcanum of magic it is declared that "he controls the soul who
controls the blood of another." As long as the magician does not fail,
the elemental will fulfil to the letter his obligation under the pact,
but the demon will try in every possible way to prevent the magician
from carrying out his part of the contract. When the conjurer, ensconced
within his circle, has evoked the spirit he desires to control and has
made known his intention, the spirit will answer somewhat as follows: "I
cannot accede to your request nor fulfil it, unless after fifty years
you give yourself to me, body and soul, to do with as I may please."

If the magician refuses, other terms will be discussed. The spirit may
say: "I will remain in your service as long as on every Friday morning
you will go forth upon the public street giving alms in the name of
Lucifer. The first time you fail in this you belong to me."

If the magician still refuses, realizing that the demon will make it
impossible for him to fulfil his contract, other terms will be
discussed, until at last a pact is agreed upon. It may read as follows:
"I hereby promise the Great Spirit Lucifuge, Prince of Demons, that each
year I will bring unto him a human soul to do with as it may please him,
and in return Lucifuge promises to bestow upon me the treasures of the
earth and fulfil my every desire for the length of my natural life. If I
fail to bring him each year the offering specified above, then my own
soul shall be forfeit to him. Signed . . . . . . . . . . . . . "
\[Invocant signs pact with his own blood.\]

### THE PENTAGRAM

In symbolism, an inverted figure always signifies a perverted power. The
average person does not even suspect the occult properties of emblematic
pentacles. On this subject the great Paracelsus has written: "No doubt
many will scoff at the seals, their characters and their uses, which are
described in these books, because it seems incredible to them that
metals and characters which are dead should have any power and effect.
Yet no one has ever proved that the metals and also the characters as we
know them are dead, for the salts, sulphur, and quintessences of metals
are the highest preservatives of human life and are far superior to all
other simples." (Translated from the original German.)

The black magician cannot use the symbols of white magic without
bringing down upon himself the forces of white magic, which would be
fatal to his schemes. He must therefore distort the hierograms so that
they typify the occult fact that he himself is distorting the principles
for which the symbols stand. Black magic is not a fundamental art; it is
the misuse of an art. Therefore it has no symbols of its own. It merely
takes the emblematic figures of white magic, and by inverting and
reversing them signifies that it is left-handed.

A good instance of this practice is found in the pentagram, or
five-pointed star, made of five connected lines. This figure is the
time-honored symbol of the magical arts, and signifies the five
properties of the Great Magical Agent, the five senses of man, the five
elements of nature, the five extremities of the human body. By means of
the pentagram within his own soul, man not only may master and govern
all creatures inferior to himself, but may demand consideration at the
hands of those superior to himself.

The pentagram is used extensively in black magic, but when so used its
form always differs in one of three ways: The star may be broken at one
point by not permitting the converging lines to touch; it may be
inverted by having one point down and two up; or it may be distorted by
having the points of varying lengths. When used in black magic, the
pentagram is called the "sign of the cloven hoof," or the footprint of
the Devil. The star with two points upward is also called the "Goat of
Mendes," because the inverted star is the same shape as a goat's head.
When the upright star turns and the upper point falls to the bottom, it
signifies the fall of the Morning Star.
