# An Analysis of Tarot Cards

OPINIONS of authorities differ widely concerning the origin of playing
cards, the purpose for which they were intended, and the time of their
introduction into Europe. In his Researches into the History of Playing
Cards, Samuel Weller Singer advances the opinion that cards reached
Southern Europe from India by way of Arabia. It is probable that the
Tarot cards were part of the magical and philosophical lore secured by
the Knights Templars from the Saracens or one of the mystical sects then
flourishing in Syria. Returning to Europe, the Templars, to avoid
persecution, concealed the arcane meaning of the symbols by introducing
the leaves of their magical book ostensibly as a device for amusement
and gambling. In support of this contention, Mrs. John King Van
Rensselaer states:

"That cards were brought by the home-returning warriors, who imported
many of the newly acquired customs and habits of the Orient to their own
countries, seems to be a well-established fact; and it does not
contradict the statement made by some writers who declared that the
gypsies--who about that time began to wander over Europe--brought with
them and introduced cards, which they used, as they do at the present
day, for divining the future." (See *The Devil's Picture Books*.)

Through the Gypsies the Tarot cards may be traced back to the religious
symbolism of the ancient Egyptians. In his remarkable work, *The
Gypsies*, Samuel Roberts presents ample proof of their Egyptian origin.
In one place he writes: "When Gypsies originally arrived in England is
very uncertain. They are first noticed in our laws, by several statutes
against them in the reign of Henry VIII.; in which they are described as
'an outlandish people, calling themselves Egyptians,--who do not profess
any craft or trade, but go about in great numbers, \* \* \*.'" A curious
legend relates that after the destruction of the Serapeum in Alexandria,
the large body of attendant priests banded themselves together to
preserve the secrets of the rites of Serapis. Their descendants
(Gypsies) carrying with them the most precious of the volumes saved from
the burning library--the Book of Enoch, or Thoth (the Tarot)--became
wanderers upon the face of the earth, remaining a people apart with an
ancient language and a birthright of magic and mystery.

Court de Gébelin believed the word Tarot itself to be derived from two
Egyptian words, *Tar*, meaning "road," and *Ro*, meaning "royal." Thus
the Tarot constitutes the *royal road to wisdom*. (See *Le Monde
Primitif*.) In his *History of Magic*, P. Christian, the mouthpiece of a
certain French secret society, presents a fantastic account of a
purported initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries wherein the 22 major
Tarots assume the proportions of trestleboards of immense size and line
a great gallery. Stopping before each card in turn, the initiator
described its symbolism to the candidate. Edouard Schuré, whose source
of information was similar to that of Christian's, hints at the same
ceremony in his chapter on initiation into the Hermetic Mysteries. (See
*The Great Initiates*.) While the Egyptians may well have employed the
Tarot cards in their rituals, these French mystics present no evidence
other than their own assertions to support this theory. The validity
also of the so-called Egyptian Tarots now in circulation has never been
satisfactorily established. The drawings are not only quite modem but
the symbolism itself savors of French rather than Egyptian influence.

The Tarot is undoubtedly a vital element in Rosicrucian symbolism,
possibly the very book of universal knowledge which the members of the
order claimed to possess. The *Rota Mundi* is a term frequently
occurring in the early manifestoes of the Fraternity of the Rose Cross.
The word *Rota* by a rearrangement of its letters becomes *Taro*, the
ancient name of these mysterious cards. W. F. C. Wigston has discovered
evidence that Sir Francis Bacon employed the Tarot symbolism in his
ciphers. The numbers 21, 56, and 78, which are all directly related to
the divisions of the Tarot deck, are frequently involved in Bacon's
cryptograms. In the great Shakespearian Folio of 1623 the Christian name
of Lord Bacon appears 21 times on page 56 of the Histories. (See *The
Columbus of Literature*.)

Many symbols appearing upon the Tarot cards have definite Masonic
interest. The Pythagorean numerologist will also find an important
relationship to exist between the numbers on the cards and the designs
accompanying the numbers. The Qabbalist will be immediately impressed by
the significant sequence of the cards, and the alchemist will discover
certain emblems meaningless save to one versed in the divine chemistry
of transmutation and regeneration.' As the Greeks placed the letters of
their alphabet--with their corresponding numbers--upon the various parts
of the body of their humanly represented *Logos*, so the Tarot cards
have an analogy not only in the parts and members of the universe but
also in the divisions of the human body.. They are in fact the key to
the magical constitution of man.

The Tarot cards must be considered (1) as separate and complete
hieroglyphs, each representing a distinct principle, law, power, or
element in Nature; (2) in relation to each other as the effect of one
agent operating upon another; and (3) as vowels and consonants of a
philosophic alphabet. The laws governing all phenomena are represented
by the symbols upon the Tarot cards, whose numerical values are equal to
the numerical equivalents of the phenomena. As every structure consists
of certain elemental parts, so the Tarot cards represent the components
of the structure of philosophy. Irrespective of the science or
philosophy with which the student is working, the Tarot cards can be
identified with the essential constituents of his subject, each card
thus being related to a specific part according to mathematical and
philosophical laws. "An imprisoned person," writes Eliphas Levi, "with
no other book than the Tarot, if he knew how to use it, could in a few
years acquire universal knowledge, and would be able to speak on all
subjects with unequalled learning and inexhaustible eloquence. " (See
*Transcendental Magic*.)

The diverse opinions of eminent authorities on the Tarot symbolism are
quite irreconcilable. The conclusions of the scholarly Court de Gébelin
and the bizarre Grand Etteila--the first authorities on the subject--not
only are at radical variance but both are equally discredited by Levi,
whose arrangement of the Tarot trumps was rejected in turn by Arthur
Edward Waite and Paul Case as being an effort to mislead students. The
followers of Levi--especially Papus, Christian, Westcott, and Schuré-are
regarded by the "reformed Tarotists" as honest but benighted individuals
who wandered in darkness for lack of Pamela Coleman Smith's new deck of
Tarot cards with revisions by Mr. Waite.

Most writers on the Tarot (Mr. Waite a notable exception) have proceeded
upon the hypothesis that the 22 major trumps represent the letters of
the Hebrew alphabet. This supposition is based upon nothing more
substantial than the coincidence that both consist of 22 parts. That
Postel, St. Martin, and Levi all wrote books divided into sections
corresponding to the major Tarots is an interesting sidelight on the
subject. The major trump cards portray incidents from the Book of
Revelation; and the Apocalypse of St. John is also divided into 22
chapters. Assuming the Qabbalah to hold the solution to the Tarot
riddle, seekers have often ignored other possible lines of research. The
task, however, of discovering the proper relationship sustained by the
Tarot trumps to the letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the Paths of
Wisdom thus far has not met with any great

EARLY PORTUGUESE CARDS.  

From Chatto's *Origin and History of Playing Cards*.

In writing of the deck from which the four cavaliers (jacks) here
reproduced were taken, William Andrew Chatto notes: "Some of the
specimens of Portuguese cards given in the 'Jeux de Cartes, Tarots et de
Cartes Numérales' have very much the appearance of having been
originally suggested by, if net copied from, an Oriental type; more
especially in the suits of Danari and Bastani,--Money and Clubs. In
those cards the circular figure, generally understood as representing
Danari, or Money, is certainly much more like the Chakra, or quoit of
Vichnou \[Vishnu\], as seen in Hindostanic drawings, than a piece of
coin; while on the top of the Club is a diamond proper, which is another
of the attributes of the same deity." Also worthy of note are the
Rosicrucian and Masonic emblems appearing on various mediæval decks. As
the secrets of these organizations were often concealed in cryptic
engravings, it is very probable that the enigmatic diagrams upon various
decks of cards were used both to conceal and to perpetuate the political
and philosophical arcana of these orders. The frontispiece of Mr.
Chatto's books shows a knave of hearts bearing a shield emblazoned with
a crowned Rosicrucian rose.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

measure of success. The major trumps of the Tarot and the 22 letters of
the Hebrew alphabet cannot be synchronized without first fixing the
correct place of the unnumbered, or zero, card--*Le Mat*, the Fool. Levi
places this card between the 20th and 21st Tarots, assigning to it the
Hebrew letter Shin (ש). The same order is followed by Papus, Christian,
and Waite, the last, however, declaring this arrangement to be
incorrect. Westcott makes the zero card the 22nd of the Tarot major
trumps. On the other hand, both Court de Gébelin and Paul Case place the
unnumbered card before the first numbered card of the major trumps, for
if the natural order of the numbers (according to either the Pythagorean
or Qabbalistic system) be adhered to, the zero card must naturally
precede the number 1.

This does not dispose of the problem, however, for efforts to assign a
Hebrew letter to each Tarot trump in sequence produce an effect far from
convincing. Mr. Waite, who reedited the Tarot, expresses himself thus:
"I am not to be included among those who are satisfied that there is a
valid correspondence between Hebrew letters and Tarot Trump symbols."
(See introduction to *The Book of Formation* by Knut Stenring.) The real
explanation may be that the major Tarots no longer are in the same
sequence as when they formed the leaves of Hermes' sacred book, for the
Egyptians--or even their Arabian successors--could have purposely
confused the cards so that their secrets might be better preserved. Mr.
Case has developed a system which, while superior to most, depends
largely upon two debatable points, namely, the accuracy of Mr. Waite's
revised Tarot and the justification for assigning the first letter of
the Hebrew alphabet to the unnumbered, or zero, card. Since *Aleph* (the
first Hebrew letter) has the numerical value of 1, its assignment to the
zero card is equivalent to the statement that zero is equal to the
letter *Aleph* and therefore synonymous with the number 1.

With rare insight, Court de Gébelin assigned the zero card to AIN SOPH,
the Unknowable First Cause. As the central panel of the Bembine Table
represents the Creative Power surrounded by seven triads of manifesting
divinities, so may the zero card represent that Eternal Power of which
the 21 surrounding or manifesting aspects are but limited expressions.
If the 21 major trumps be considered as limited forms existing in the
abstract substance of the zero card, it then becomes their common
denominator. Which letter, then, of the Hebrew alphabet is the origin of
all the remaining letters? The answer is apparent: Yod. In the presence
of so many speculations, one more may not offend. The zero card--*Le
Mat*, the Fool--has been likened to the material universe because the
mortal sphere is the world of unreality. The lower universe, like the
mortal body of man, is but a garment, a motley costume, well likened to
cap and bells. Beneath the garments of the fool is the divine substance,
however, of which the jester is but a shadow; this world is a Mardi
Gras--a pageantry of divine sparks masked in the garb of fools. Was not
this zero card (the Fool) placed in the Tarot deck to deceive all who
could not pierce the veil of illusion?

The Tarot cards were entrusted by the illumined hierophants of the
Mysteries into the keeping of the foolish and the ignorant, thus
becoming playthings--in many instances even instruments of vice. Man's
evil habits therefore actually became the unconscious perpetuators of
his philosophical precepts. "We must admire the wisdom of the
Initiates," writes Papus, "who utilized vice and made it produce more
beneficial results than virtue." Does not this act of the ancient
priests itself afford proof that the entire mystery of the Tarot is
wrapped up in the symbolism of its zero card? If knowledge was thus
entrusted to fools, should it not be sought for in this card?

If *Le Mat* be placed before the first card of the Tarot deck and the
others laid out in a horizontal line in sequence from left to right, it
will be found that the Fool is walking toward the other trumps as though
about to pass through the various cards. Like the spiritually hoodwinked
and bound neophyte, *Le Mat* is about to enter upon the supreme
adventure--that of passage through the gates of the Divine Wisdom. If
the zero card be considered as extraneous to the major trumps, this
destroys the numerical analogy between these cards and the Hebrew
letters by leaving one letter without a Tarot correspondent. In this
event it will be necessary to assign the missing letter to a
hypothetical Tarot card called the elements, assumed to have been broken
up to form the 56 cards of the minor trumps. It is possible that each of
the major trumps may be subject to a similar division.

The first numbered major trump is called *Le Bateleur*, the juggler, and
according to Court de Gébelin, indicates the entire fabric of creation
to be but a dream, existence a juggling of divine elements, and life a
perpetual game of hazard. The seeming miracles of Nature are but feats
of cosmic legerdemain. Man is like the little ball in the hands of the
juggler, who waves his wand and, presto! the ball vanishes. The world
looking on does not realize that the vanished article is still cleverly
concealed by the juggler in the hollow of his hand. This is also the
Adept whom Omar Khayyám calls "the master of the show." His message is
that the wise direct the phenomena of Nature and are never deceived
thereby.

The magician stands behind a table on which are spread out a number of
objects, prominent among them a cup--the Holy Grail and the cup placed
by Joseph in Benjamin's sack; a coin--the tribute money and the wages of
a Master Builder, and a sword, that of Goliath and also the mystic blade
of the philosopher which divides the false from the true. The magician's
hat is in the form of the cosmic lemniscate, signifying the first motion
of creation. His right hand points to the earth, his left holds aloft
the rod of Jacob and also the staff that budded--the human spine crowned
with the globe of creative intelligence. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot
the magician wears an *uræus* or golden band around his forehead, the
table before him is in the form of a perfect cube, and his girdle is the
serpent of eternity devouring its own tail.

The second numbered major trump is called *La Papesse*, the Female Pope,
and has been associated with a curious legend of the only woman who ever
sat in the pontifical chair. Pope Joan is supposed to have accomplished
this by masquerading in malt attire, and was stoned to death when her
subterfuge was discovered. This card portrays a seated woman crowned
with a tiara surmounted by a lunar crescent. In her lap is the *Tora*,
or book of the Law (usually partly closed), and in her left hand are the
keys to the secret doctrine, one gold and the other silver. Behind her
rise two pillars (Jachin and Boaz) with a multicolored veil stretched
between. Her throne stands upon a checker-hoard floor. A figure called
Juno is occasionally substituted for La Papesse. like the female
hierophant of the Mysteries of Cybele, this symbolic figure personifies
the Shekinah, or Divine Wisdom. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the
priestess is veiled, a reminder that the full countenance truth is not
revealed to uninitiated man. A veil also covers one-half of her book,
thus intimating that but one-half of the mystery of being can be
comprehended.

The third numbered major trump is called *L'Impératrice*, the Empress,
and has been likened to the "woman clothed with the sun" described in
the Apocalypse. On this card appears the winged figure of a woman seated
upon a throne, supporting with her right hand a shield emblazoned with a
phœnix and holding in her left a scepter surmounted by an orb or
trifoliate flower. Beneath her left foot is sometimes shown the
crescent. Either the Empress is crowned or her head is surrounded by a
diadem of stars; sometimes both. She is called *Generation*, and
represents the threefold spiritual world out of which proceeds the
fourfold material world. To the graduate of the College of the Mysteries
she is the *Alma Mater* out of whose body the initiate has "born again."
In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Empress is shown seated upon a cube
filled with eyes and a bird is balanced upon the forefinger other left
hand. The upper part of her body is surrounded by a radiant golden
nimbus. Being emblematic of the power from which emanates the entire
tangible universe, *L'Impératrice* is frequently symbolized as pregnant.

The fourth numbered major trump is called *L'Empereur*, the Emperor, and
by its numerical value is directly associated with the great Deity
revered by the Pythagoreans under the form of the tetrad. His symbols
declare the Emperor to be the Demiurgus, the Great King of the inferior
world. The Emperor is dressed in armor and his throne is a cube stone,
upon which a phœnix is also clearly visible. The king has his legs
crossed in a most significant manner and carries either a scepter
surmounted by an orb or a scepter in his right hand and an orb n his
left. The orb itself is evidence that he is supreme ruler of the world.
Upon his right and left breasts respectively appear the symbols of the
sun and moon, which in symbolism are referred to as the eyes of the
Great King. The position of the body and legs forms the symbol of
sulphur, the sign of the ancient alchemical monarch. In the
pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the figure is in profile. He wears a Masonic apron
and the skirt forms s right-angled triangle. Upon his head is the Crown
of the North and his forehead is adorned wit the coiled *uræus*.

The fifth numbered major trump is called *Le Pape*, the Pope, and
represents the high priest of a pagan or Christian Mystery school. In
this card the hierophant wears the tiara and carries in his left hand
the triple cross surmounting the globe of the world. His right hand,
bearing upon its back the stigmata, makes "the ecclesiastic sign of
esotericism," and before him kneel two suppliants or acolytes. The back
of the papal throne is in the form of a celestial and a terrestrial
column. This card signifies the initiate or master of the mystery of
life and according to the Pythagoreans, the spiritual physician. The
illusionary universe in the form of the two figures (polarity) kneels
before the throne upon which sits the initiate who has elevated his
consciousness to the plane of spiritual understanding and reality. In
the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Master wears the *uræus*. A white and a
black figure--life and death, light and darkness, good and evil--kneel
before him. The initiate's mastery over unreality is indicated by the
tiara and the triple cross, emblems of rulership over the three worlds
which have issued from the Unknowable First Cause.

The sixth numbered major trump is called *L'Amoureux*, the Lovers. There
are two distinct forms of this Tarot. One shows a marriage ceremony in
which a priest is uniting a youth and a maiden (Adam and Eve?) in holy
wedlock. Sometimes a winged figure above transfixes the lovers with his
dart. The second form of the card portrays a youth with a female figure
on either side. One of these figures wears a golden crown and is winged,
while the other is attired in the flowing robes of the bacchante and on
her head is a wreath of vine leaves. The maidens represent the twofold
soul of man (spiritual and animal), the first his guardian angel and the
second his ever-present demon. The youth stands at the beginning of
mature life, "the Parting of the Ways," where he must choose between
virtue and vice, the eternal and the temporal. Above, in a halo of
light, is the genius of Fate (his star), mistaken for Cupid by the
uninformed. If youth chooses unwisely, the arrow of blindfolded Fate
will transfix him. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the arrow of the genius
points directly to the figure of vice, thereby signifying that the end
of her path is destruction. This card reminds man that the price of free
will--or, more correctly, the power of choice--is responsibility.

The seventh numbered major trump is called *Le Chariot*, the Chariot,
and portrays a victorious warrior crowned and riding in a chariot drawn
by black and white sphinxes or horses. The starry canopy of the chariot
is upheld by four columns. This card signifies the Exalted One who rides
in the chariot of creation. The vehicle of the solar energy being
numbered seven reveals the arcane truth that the seven planers are the
chariots of the solar power which rides victorious in their midst. The
four columns supporting the canopy represent the four Mighty Ones who
uphold the worlds represented by the star-strewn drapery. The figure
carries the scepter of the solar energy and its shoulders are ornamented
with lunar crescents--the Urim. and Thummim. The sphinxes drawing the
chariot resent the secret and unknown power by which the victorious
ruler is moved continuously through the various parts of his universe.
In certain Tarot decks the victor signifies the regenerated man, for the
body of the chariot is a cubic stone. The man in armor is not standing
in the chariot but is rising out of the cube, thus typifying the
ascension of the 3 out of the 4--the turning upward of the flap of the
Master Mason's apron. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the warrior carries
the curved sword of Luna, is bearded to signify maturity, and wears the
collar of the planetary orbits. His scepter (emblematic of the threefold
universe) is crowned with a square upon which is a circle surmounted by
a triangle.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

The eighth numbered major trump is called *La Justice*, Justice, and
portrays a seated figure upon a throne, the back of which rises in the
form of two columns. Justice is crowned and carries in her right hand a
sword and in her left a pair of scales. This card is a reminder of the
judgment of the soul in the hall of Osiris. It teaches that only
balanced forces can endure and that eternal justice destroys with the
sword that which is unbalanced. Sometimes justice is depicted with a
braid of her own hair twisted around her neck in a manner resembling a
hangman's knot. This may subtly imply that man is the cause of his own
undoing, his actions (symbolized by his hair) being the instrument of
his annihilation. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the figure of Justice is
raised upon a dais of three steps, for justice can be fully administered
only by such as have been elevated to the third degree. Justice is
blindfolded, that the visible shall in no way influence its decision.
(For reasons he considers beyond his readers' intelligence, Mr. Waite
reversed the eighth and eleventh major trumps.)

The ninth numbered major trump is called *L'Hermite*, the Hermit, and
portrays an aged man, robed in a monkish habit and cowl, leaning on a
staff. This card was popularly supposed to represent Diogenes in his
quest for an honest man. In his right hand the recluse carries a lamp
which he partly conceals within the folds of his cape. The hermit
thereby personifies the secret organizations which for uncounted
centuries have carefully concealed the light of the Ancient Wisdom from
the profane. The staff of the hermit is knowledge, which is man's main
and only enduring support. Sometimes the mystic rod is divided by knobs
into seven sections, a subtle reference to the mystery of the seven
sacred centers along the human spine. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the
hermit shields the lamp behind a rectangular cape to emphasize the
philosophic truth that wisdom, if exposed to the fury of ignorance,
would be destroyed like the tiny flame of a lamp unprotected from the
storm. Man's bodies form a cloak through which his divine nature is
faintly visible like the flame of the partly covered lantern. Through
renunciation--the Hermetic life--man attains depth of character and
[tranquility](errata.htm#10.md) of spirit.

The tenth numbered major trump is called *La Roue de Fortune*, the Wheel
of Fortune, and portrays a mysterious wheel with eight spokes--the
familiar Buddhist symbol of the Cycle of Necessity. To its rim cling
Anubis and Typhon--the principles of good and evil. Above sits the
immobile sphinx, carrying the sword of Justice and signifying the
perfect equilibrium of Universal Wisdom. Anubis is shown rising and
Typhon descending; but when Typhon reaches the bottom, evil ascends
again, and when Anubis reaches the top good wanes once more. The Wheel
of Fortune represents the lower universe as a whole with Divine Wisdom
(the sphinx) as the eternal arbiter between good and evil. In India, the
*chakra*, or wheel, is associated with the life centers either of a
world or of an individual. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Sphinx is
armed with a javelin, and Typhon is being thrown from the wheel. The
vertical columns, supporting the wheel and so placed that but one is
visible, represent the axis of the world with the inscrutable sphinx
upon its northern pole. Sometimes the wheel with its supports is in a
boat upon the water. The water is the Ocean of Illusion, which is the
sole foundation of the Cycle of Necessity.

The eleventh numbered major trump is called La Force, Strength, and
portrays a girl wearing a hat in the form of a lemniscate, with her
hands upon the mouth of an apparently ferocious lion. Considerable
controversy exists as to whether the maid is dosing or opening the
lion's mouth. Most writers declare her to be closing the jaws of the
beast, but a critical inspection conveys the opposite impression. The
young woman symbolizes spiritual strength and the lion either the animal
world which the girl is mastering or the Secret Wisdom over which she is
mistress. The lion also signifies the summer solstice and the girl,
Virgo, for when the sun enters this constellation, the Virgin robs the
lion of his strength. King Solomon's throne was ornamented with lions
and he himself was likened to the king of beasts with the key of wisdom
between its teeth. In this sense, the girl may be opening the lion's
mouth to find the key contained therein for courage is a prerequisite to
the attainment of knowledge. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the symbolism
is the same except that the maiden is represented as a priestess wearing
an elaborate crown in the form of a bird surmounted by serpents and an
ibis.

The twelfth numbered major trump is called *Le Pendu*, the Hanged Man,
an portrays a young man hanging by his left leg from a horizontal beam,
the latter supported by two tree trunks from each of which six branches
have been removed. The right leg of the youth is crossed in back of the
left and his arms are folded behind his back in such a way as to form a
cross surmounting a downward pointing triangle. The figure thus forms an
inverted symbol of sulphur and, according to Levi, signifies the
accomplishment of the *magnum opus*. In some decks the figure carries
under each arm a money bag from which coins are escaping. Popular
tradition associates this card with Judas Iscariot, who is said to have
gone forth and hanged himself, the money bags representing the payment
he received for his crime.

Levi likens the hanged man to Prometheus, the Eternal Sufferer, further
declaring that the upturned feet signify the spiritualization of the
lower nature. It is also possible that the inverted figure denotes the
loss of the spiritual faculties, for the head is below the level of the
body. The stumps of the twelve branches are the signs of the zodiac
divided into two groups--positive and negative. The picture therefore
depicts polarity temporarily triumphant over the spiritual principle of
equilibrium. To attain the heights of philosophy, therefore, man must
reverse (or invert) the order of his life. He then loses his sense of
personal possession because he renounces the rule of gold in favor of
the golden rule. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the hanged man is
suspended between two palm trees and signifies the Sun God who dies
perennially for his world.

The thirteenth numbered major trump is called *La Mort*, Death, and
portrays a reaping skeleton with a great scythe cutting off the heads,
hands, and feet rising out of the earth about it. In the course of its
labors the skeleton has apparently cut off one of its own feet. Not all
Tarot decks show this peculiarity, but this point well emphasizes the
philosophic truth that unbalance and destructiveness are synonymous. The
skeleton is the proper emblem of the first and supreme Deity because it
is the foundation of the body, as the Absolute is the foundation of
creation. The reaping skeleton physically signifies death but
philosophically that irresistible impulse in Nature which causes every
being to be ultimately absorbed into the divine condition in which it
existed before the illusionary universe had been manifested. The blade
of the scythe is the moon with its crystallizing power. The field in
which death reaps is the universe, and the card discloses that all
things growing out of the earth shall be cut down and return to earth
again.

Kings, Queens, courtesans, and knaves are alike to death, the master of
the visible and a parent parts of all creatures. In some Tarot decks
death is symbolized as a figure in armor mounted on a white horse which
tramples under foot old and young alike. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot a
rainbow is seen behind the figure of death, thus signifying that the
mortality of the body of itself achieves the immortality of the spirit.
Death, though it destroys form, can never destroy life, which
continually renews itself. This card is the symbol of the constant
renovation of the universe--disintegration that reintegration may follow
upon a higher level of expression.

The fourteenth numbered major trump is called *La Temperance*,
Temperance, and portrays an angelic figure with the sun upon her
forehead. She carries two urns, one empty and the other full, and
continually pours the contents of the upper into the lower, In some
Tarot decks the flowing water takes the form of the symbol of Aquarius.
Not one drop, however, of the living water is lost in this endless
transference between the superior vessel and the inferior. When the
lower urn is filled the vases are reversed, thus signifying that life
pours first from the invisible into the visible, then from the visible
back into the invisible. The spirit controlling this flow is an emissary
of the great Jehovah, Demiurgus of the world. The sun, or light cluster,
upon the woman's forehead controls the flow of water, which, being drawn
upward into the air by the solar rays, descends upon the earth as rain,
to drawn up and fall again *ad infinitum*. Herein is also shown the
passage of the human life forces back and forth between positive and
negative poles of the creative system. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the
symbolism is the same, except that the winged figure is male instead of
female. It is surrounded by a solar nimbus and pours water from a golden
urn into a silver one, typifying the descent of celestial forces into
the sublunary spheres.

The fifteenth numbered major trump is called *Le Diable*, the Devil, and
portrays a creature resembling Pan with the horns of a ram or deer, the
arms and body of a man, and the legs and feet of a goat or dragon. The
figure stands upon a cubic stone, to a ring in the front of which are
chained two satyrs. For a scepter this so-called demon carries a lighted
torch or candle. The entire figure is symbolic of the magic powers of
the astral light, or universal mirror, in which the divine forces are
reflected in an inverted, or infernal, state. The demon is winged like a
bar, showing that it pertains to the nocturnal, or shadow inferior
sphere. The animal natures of man, in the form of a male and a female
elemental, are chained to its footstool. The torch is the false light
which guides unillumined souls to their own undoing. In the
pseudo-Egyptian Tarot appears Typhon--a winged creature composed of a
hog, a man, a bat, a crocodile, and a hippopotamus--standing in the
midst of its own destructiveness and holding aloft the firebrand of the
incendiary. Typhon is created by man's own misdeeds, which, turning upon
their maker, destroy him.

The sixteenth numbered major trump is called *Le Feu du Ciel*, the Fire
of Heaven, and portrays a tower the battlements of which, in the form of
a crown, are being destroyed by a bolt of lightning *issuing from the
sun*. The crown, being considerably smaller than the tower which it
surmounts, possibly indicates that its destruction resulted from its
insufficiency. The lighting bolt sometimes takes the form of the
zodiacal sign of Scorpio, and the tower may be considered a phallic
emblem. Two figures are failing from the tower, one in front and the
other behind. This Tarot card is popularly associated with the
traditional fall of man. The divine nature of humanity is depicted as a
tower. When his crown is destroyed, man falls into the lower world and
takes upon himself the illusion of materiality. Here also is a key to
the mystery of sex. The tower is supposedly filled with gold coins
which, showering out in great numbers from the rent made by the
lightning bolt, suggesting potential powers. In the pseudo-Egyptian
Tarot the tower is a pyramid, its apex shattered by a lightning bolt.
Here is a reference to the missing capstone of the Universal House. In
support of Levi's contention that this card is connected with the Hebrew
letter *Ayin*, the failing figure in the foreground is similar in
general appearance to the sixteenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet.

The seventeenth numbered major trump is called *Les Etoiles*, the Stars,
and portrays a young girl kneeling with one foot in water and the other
on and, her body somewhat suggesting the swastika. She has two urns, the
contents of which she pours upon the land and sea. Above the girl's head
are eight stars, one of which is exceptionally large and bright. Count
de Gébelin considers the great star to be Sothis or Sirius; the other
seven are the sacred planets of the ancients. He believes the female
figure to be Isis in the act of causing the inundations of the Nile
which accompanied the rising of the Dog Star. The unclothed figure of
Isis may well signify that Nature does not receive her garment of
verdure until the rising of the Nile waters releases the germinal life
of plants and flowers. The bush and bird (or butterfly) signify the
growth and resurrection which accompany the rising of the waters. In the
pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the great star contains a diamond composed of a
black and white triangle, and the flowering bush is a tall plant with a
trifoliate head upon which a butterfly alights. Here Isis is in the form
of an upright triangle and the vases have become shallow cups. The
elements of water and earth under her feet represent the opposites of
Nature sharing impartially in the divine abundance.

The eighteenth numbered major trump is called *La Lune*, the Moon, and
portrays Luna rising between two towers--one light and the other dark. A
dog and a wolf are baying at the rising moon, and in the foreground is a
pool of water from which emerges a crawfish. Between the towers a path

A CARD FROM THE MANTEGNA PACK.  

From Taylor's *The History of Playing Cards*.

Among the more curious examples of playing cards are those of the
Mantegna deck. In 1820, a perfect deck of fifty cards brought the then
amazing price of eighty pounds. The fifty subjects composing the
Mantegna deck, each of which is represented by an appropriate figure,
are: (1) A beggar; (2) A page; (3) A goldsmith; (4) A merchant; (5) A
gentleman; (6) A knight; (7) The Doge; (8) A king; (9) An emperor, (10)
The Pope; (11) Calliope; (12) Urania; (13) Terpsichore; (14) Erato; (15)
Polyhymnia; (16) Thalia; (17) Melpomene; (18) Euterpe; (19) Clio; (20)
Apollo; (21) Grammar, (22) Logic; (23) Rhetoric; (24) Geometry; (25)
Arithmetic; (26) Music, (27) Poetry; (28) Philosophy; (29) Astrology;
(30) Theology; (31) Astronomy; (32) Chronology (33) Cosmogony; (34)
Temperance; (35) Prudence; (36) Fortitude; (37) Justice; (38) Charity;
(39) Fortitude, (40) Faith; (41) the Moon; (42) Mercury; (43) Venus;
(45) the Sun; (45) Mars; (46) Jupiter; (47) Saturn; (48) the eighth
Sphere; (49) the Primum Mobile; (50) the First Cause. The Qabbalistic
significance of these cards is apparent, and it is possible that they
have a direct analogy to the fifty gates of light referred to in
Qabbalistic writings.

winds, vanishing in the extreme background. Court de Gébelin sees in
this card another reference to the rising of the Nile and states on the
authority of Pausanius that the Egyptians believed the inundations of
the Nile to result from the tears of the moon goddess which, falling
into the river, swelled its flow. These tears are seen dropping from the
lunar face. Court de Gébelin also relates the towers to the Pillars of
Hercules, beyond which, according to the Egyptians, the luminaries never
passed. He notes also that the Egyptians represented the tropics as dogs
who as faithful doorkeepers prevented the sun and moon from penetrating
too near the poles. The crab or crawfish signifies the retrograde motion
of the moon.

This card also refers to the path of wisdom. Man in his quest of reality
emerges from the pool of illusion. After mastering the guardians of the
gates of wisdom he passes between the fortresses of science and theology
and follows the winding path leading to spiritual liberation. His way is
faintly lighted by human reason (the moon), which is but a reflection of
divine wisdom. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the towers are pyramids, the
dogs are black and white respectively, and the moon is partly obscured
by clouds. The entire scene suggests the dreary and desolate place in
which the Mystery dramas of the Lesser Rites were enacted.

The nineteenth numbered major trump is called *Le Soleil*, the Sun, and
portrays two children--probably Gemini, the Twins--standing together in
a garden surrounded by a magic ring of flowers. One of these children
should be shown as male and the other female. Behind them is a brick
wall apparently enclosing the garden. Above the wall the sun is rising,
its rays alternately straight and curved. Thirteen teardrops are falling
from the solar face Levi, seeing in the two children Faith and Reason,
which must coexist as long as the temporal universe endures, writes:
"Human equilibrium requires two feet, the worlds gravitate by means of
two forces, generation needs two sexes. Such is the meaning of the
arcanum of Solomon, represented by the two pillars of the temple, Jakin
and Bohas." (See *Transcendental Magic*.) The sun of Truth is shining
into the garden of the world over which these two children, as
personifications of eternal powers reside. The harmony of the world
depends upon the coordination of two qualities symbolized throughout the
ages as the mind and the heart. In the pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the
children give place to a youth and a maiden. Above them in a solar
nimbus is the phallic emblem of generation--a line piercing a circle.
Gemini is ruled by Mercury and the two children personify the serpents
entwined around the *caduceus*.

The twentieth numbered major trump is called *Le Jugement*, the
judgment, and portrays three figures rising apparently from their tombs,
though but one coffin is visible. Above them in a blaze of glory is a
winged figure (presumably the Angel Gabriel) blowing a trumpet. This
Tarot represents the liberation of man's threefold spiritual nature from
the sepulcher of his material constitution. Since but one-third of the
spirit actually enters the physical body, the other two-thirds
constituting the Hermetic *anthropos* or *overman*, only one of the
three figures is actually rising from the tomb. Court de Gébelin
believes that the coffin may have been an afterthought of the card
makers and that the scene actually represents creation rather than
resurrection, In philosophy these two words are practically synonymous.
The blast of the trumpet represents the Creative Word, by the intoning
of which man is liberated from his terrestrial limitations. In the
pseudo-Egyptian Tarot it is evident that the three figures signify the
parts of a single being, for three mummies are shown emerging from one
mummy case.

The twenty-first numbered major trump is called *Le Monde*, the World,
and portrays a female figure draped with a scarf which the wind blows
into the form of the Hebrew letter Kaph. Her extended hands--each of
which holds a wand--and her left leg, which crosses behind the right,
cause the figure to assume the form of the alchemical symbol of sulphur.
The central figure is surrounded by a wreath in the form of a *vesica
piscis* which Levi likens to the Qabbalistic crown *Kether*. The
Cherubim of Ezekiel's vision occupy the corners of the card. This Tarot
is called the Microcosm and the Macrocosm because in it are summed up
every agency contributing to the structure of creation. The figure in
the form Of the emblem of sulphur represents the divine fire and the
heart of the Great Mystery. The wreath is Nature, which surrounds the
fiery center. The Cherubim represent the elements, worlds, forces, and
planes issuing out of the divine fiery center of life. The wreath
signifies the crown of the initiate which is given to those who master
the four guardians and enter into the presence of unveiled Truth. In the
pseudo-Egyptian Tarot the Cherubim surround a wreath composed of twelve
trifoliate flowers--the decanates of the zodiac. A human figure kneels
below this wreath, playing upon a harp of three strings, for the spirit
must create harmony in the triple constitution of its inferior nature
before it can gain for itself the solar crown of immortality.

The four suits of the minor trumps are considered as analogous to the
four elements, the four corners of creation, and the four worlds of
Qabbalism. The key to the lesser Tarots is presumably the
*Tetragrammaton*, or the four-letter name of Jehovah, IHVH. The four
suits of the minor trumps represent also the major divisions of society:
*cups* are the priesthood, *swords* the military, *coins* the tradesmen,
and *rods* the farming class. From the standpoint of what Court de
Gébelin calls "political geography," *cups* represent the northern
countries, *swords* the Orient, *coins* the Occident, and *rods* the
southern countries. The ten pip cards of each suit represent the nations
composing each of these grand divisions. The *kings* are their
governments, the *queens* their religions, the *knights* their histories
and national characteristics, and the *pages* their arts and sciences.
Elaborate treatises have been written concerning the use of the Tarot
cards in divination, but as this practice is contrary to the primary
purpose of the Tarot no profit can result from its discussion.

Many interesting examples of early playing cards are found in the
museums of Europe, and there are also noteworthy specimens in the
cabinets of various private collectors. A few hand-painted decks exist
which are extremely artistic. These depict various important personages
contemporary with the artists. In some instances, the court cards are
portraitures of the reigning monarch and his family. In England engraved
cards became popular, and in the British Museum are also to be seen some
extremely quaint stenciled cards. Heraldic devices were employed; and
Chatto, in his *Origin and History of Playing Cards*, reproduces four
heraldic cards in which the arms of Pope Clement IX adorn the king of
clubs. There have been philosophical decks with emblems chosen from
Greek and Roman mythology, also educational decks ornamented with maps
or pictorial representations of famous historic places and incidents.
Many rare examples of playing-cards have been found bound into the
covers of early books. In Japan there are card games the successful
playing of which requires familiarity with nearly all the literary
masterpieces of that nation. In India there are circular decks depicting
episodes from Oriental myths. There are also cards which in one sense of
the word are not cards, for the designs are on wood, ivory, and even
metal. There are comic cards caricaturing disliked persons and places,
and there are cards commemorating various human achievements. During the
American Civil War a patriotic deck was circulated in which stars,
eagles, anchors, and American flags were substituted for the suits and
the court cards were famous generals.

Modern playing cards are the minor trumps of the Tarot, from each suit
of which the *page*, or *valet*, has been eliminated, leaving 13 cards.
Even in its abridged form, however, the modern deck is of profound
symbolic importance, for its arrangement is apparently in accord with
the divisions of the year. The two colors, red and black, represent the
two grand divisions of the year--that during which the sun is north of
the equator and that during which it is south of the equator. The four
suits represent the seasons, the ages of the ancient Greeks, and the
*Yugas* of the Hindus. The twelve court cards are the signs of the
zodiac arranged in triads of a Father, a Power, and a Mind according to
the upper section of the Bembine Table. The ten pip cards of each suit
represent the Sephirothic trees existing in each of the four worlds (the
suits). The 13 cards of each suit are the 13 lunar months in each year,
and the 52 cards of the deck are the 52 weeks in the year. Counting the
number of pips and reckoning the jacks, queens, and kings as 11, 12, and
13 respectively, the sum for the 52 cards is 364. If the joker be
considered as one point, the result is 365, or the number of days in the
year. Milton Pottenger believed that the United States of America was
laid out according to the conventional deck of playing cards, and that
the government will ultimately consist of 52 States administered by a
53rd undenominated division, the District of Columbia.

The court cards contain a number of important Masonic symbols. Nine are
full face and three are profile. Here is the broken "Wheel of the Law,"
signifying the nine months of the prenatal epoch and the three degrees
of spiritual unfoldment necessary to produce the perfect man. The four
armed kings are the Egyptian Ammonian Architects who gouged out the
universe with knives. They are also the cardinal signs of the zodiac.
The four queens, carrying eight-petaled flowers symbolic of the Christ,
are the fixed signs of the zodiac. The four jacks, two of whom bear
acacia sprigs--the jack of hearts in his hand, the jack of clubs in his
hat-are the four common signs of the zodiac. It should be noted also
that the court cards of the spade suit will not look upon the pip in the
corner of the card but face away from it as though fearing this emblem
of death. The Grand Master of the Order of the Cards is the king of
clubs, who carries the orb as emblematic of his dignity.

In its symbolism chess is the most significant of all games. It has been
called "the royal game"--the pastime of kings. Like the Tarot cards, the
chessmen represent the elements of life and philosophy. The game was
played in India and China long before its introduction into Europe. East
Indian princes were wont to sit on the balconies of their palaces and
play chess with living men standing upon a checkerboard pavement of
black and white marble in the courtyard below. It is popularly believed
that the Egyptian Pharaohs played chess, but an examination of their
sculpture and illuminations has led to the conclusion that the Egyptian
game was a form of draughts. In China, chessmen are often carved to
represent warring dynasties, as the Manchu and the Ming. The chessboard
consists of 64 squares alternately black and white and symbolizes the
floor of the House of the Mysteries. Upon this field of existence or
thought move a number of strangely carved figures, each according to
fixed law. The white king is Ormuzd; the black king, Ahriman; and upon
the plains of Cosmos the great war between Light and Darkness is fought
through all the ages. Of the philosophical constitution of man, the
kings represent the spirit; the queens the mind; the bishops the
emotions; the knights the vitality; the castles, or rooks, the physical
body. The pieces upon the kings' side are positive; those upon the
queens' side, negative. The pawns are the sensory impulses and
perceptive faculties--the eight parts of the soul. The white king and
his suite symbolize the Self and its vehicles; the black king and his
retinue, the not-self--the false Ego and its legion. The game of chess
thus sets forth the eternal struggle of each part of man's compound
nature against the shadow of itself. The nature of each of the chessmen
is revealed by the way in which it moves; geometry is the key to their
interpretation. For example: The castle (the body) moves on the square;
the bishop (the emotions) moves on the slant; the king, being the
spirit, cannot be captured, but loses the battle when so surrounded that
it cannot escape.
