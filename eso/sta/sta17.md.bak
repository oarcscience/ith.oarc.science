# The Human Body in Symbolism

THE oldest, the most profound, the most universal of all symbols is the
human body. The Greeks, Persians, Egyptians, and Hindus considered a
philosophical analysis of man's triune nature to be an indispensable
part of ethical and religious training. The Mysteries of every nation
taught that the laws, elements, and powers of the universe were
epitomized in the human constitution; that everything which existed
outside of man had its analogue within man. The universe, being
immeasurable in its immensity and inconceivable in its profundity, was
beyond mortal estimation. Even the gods themselves could comprehend but
a part of the inaccessible glory which was their source. When
temporarily permeated with divine enthusiasm, man may transcend for a
brief moment the limitations of his own personality and behold in part
that celestial effulgence in which all creation is bathed. But even in
his periods of greatest illumination man is incapable of imprinting upon
the substance of his rational soul a perfect image of the multiform
expression of celestial activity.

Recognizing the futility of attempting to cope intellectually with that
which transcends the comprehension of the rational faculties, the early
philosophers turned their attention from the inconceivable Divinity to
man himself, with in the narrow confines of whose nature they found
manifested all the mysteries of the external spheres. As the natural
outgrowth of this practice there was fabricated a secret theological
system in which God was considered as the Grand Man and, conversely, man
as the little god. Continuing this analogy, the universe was regarded as
a man and, conversely, man as a miniature universe. The greater universe
was termed the *Macrocosm*--the Great World or Body--and the Divine Life
or spiritual entity controlling its functions was called the
*Macroprosophus*. Man's body, or the individual human universe, was
termed the *Microcosm*, and the Divine Life or spiritual entity
controlling its functions was called the *Microprosophus*. The pagan
Mysteries were primarily concerned with instructing neophytes in the
true relationship existing between the *Macrocosm* and the
*Microcosm*--in other words, between God and man. Accordingly, the key
to these analogies between the organs and functions of the *Microcosmic*
man and those of the *Macrocosmic* Man constituted the most prized
possession of the early initiates.

In *Isis Unveiled*, H. P. Blavatsky summarizes the pagan concept of man
as follows: "Man is a little world--a microcosm inside the great
universe. Like a fetus, he is suspended, by all his *three* spirits, in
the matrix of the macrocosmos; and while his terrestrial body is in
constant sympathy with its parent earth, his astral soul lives in unison
with the sidereal *anima mundi*. He is in it, as it is in him, for the
world-pervading element fills all space, and is space itself, only
shoreless and infinite. As to his third spirit, the divine, what is it
but an infinitesimal ray, one of the countless radiations proceeding
directly from the Highest Cause--the Spiritual Light of the World? This
is the trinity of organic and inorganic nature--the spiritual and the
physical, which are three in one, and of which Proclus says that 'The
first monad is the Eternal God; the second, eternity; the third, the
paradigm, or pattern of the universe;' the three constituting the
Intelligible Triad."

Long before the introduction of idolatry into religion, the early
priests caused the statue of a man to be placed in the sanctuary of the
temple. This human figure symbolized the Divine Power in all its
intricate manifestations. Thus the priests of antiquity accepted man as
their textbook, and through the study of him learned to understand the
greater and more abstruse mysteries of the celestial scheme of which
they were a part. It is not improbable that this mysterious figure
standing over the primitive altars was made in the nature of a manikin
and, like certain emblematic hands in the Mystery schools, was covered
with either carved or painted hieroglyphs. The statue may have opened,
thus showing the relative positions of the organs, bones, muscles,
nerves, and other parts. After ages of research, the manikin became a
mass of intricate hieroglyphs and symbolic figures. Every part had its
secret meaning. The measurements formed a basic standard by means of
which it was possible to measure all parts of cosmos. It was a glorious
composite emblem of all the knowledge possessed by the sages and
hierophants.

Then came the age of idolatry. The Mysteries decayed from within. The
secrets were lost and none knew the identity of the mysterious man who
stood over the altar. It was remembered only that the figure was a
sacred and glorious symbol of the Universal Power, and it: finally came
to be looked upon as a god--the One in whose image man was made. Having
lost the knowledge of the purpose for which the manikin was originally
constructed, the priests worshiped this effigy until at last their lack
of spiritual understanding brought the temple down in ruins about their
heads and the statue crumbled with the civilization that had forgotten
its meaning.

Proceeding from this assumption of the first theologians that man is
actually fashioned in the image of God, the initiated minds of past ages
erected the stupendous structure of theology upon the foundation of the
human body. The religious world of today is almost totally ignorant of
the fact that the science of biology is the fountainhead of its
doctrines and tenets. Many of the codes and laws believed by modern
divines to have been direct revelations from Divinity are in reality the
fruitage of ages of patient delving into the intricacies of the human
constitution and the infinite wonders revealed by such a study.

In nearly all the sacred books of the world can be traced an anatomical
analogy. This is most evident in their creation myths. Anyone familiar
with embryology and obstetrics will have no difficulty in recognizing
the basis of the allegory concerning Adam and Eve and the Garden of
Eden, the nine degrees of the Eleusinian Mysteries, and the Brahmanic
legend of Vishnu's incarnations. The story of the Universal Egg, the
Scandinavian myth of Ginnungagap (the dark cleft in space in which the
seed of the world is sown), and the use of the fish as the emblem of the
paternal generative power--all show the true origin of theological
speculation. The philosophers of antiquity realized that man himself was
the key to the riddle of life, for he was the living image of the Divine
Plan, and in future ages humanity also will come to realize more fully
the solemn import of those ancient words: "The proper study of mankind
is man."

Both God and man have a twofold constitution, of which the superior part
is invisible and the inferior visible. In both there is also an
intermediary sphere, marking the point where these visible and invisible
natures meet. As the spiritual nature of God controls His objective
universal form-which is actually a crystallized idea--so the spiritual
nature of man is the invisible cause and controlling power of his
visible material personality. Thus it is evident that the spirit of man
bears the same relationship to his material body that God bears to the
objective universe. The Mysteries taught that spirit, or life, was
anterior to form and that what is anterior includes all that is
posterior to itself. Spirit being anterior to form, form is therefore
included within the realm of spirit. It is also a popular statement or
belief that man's spirit is within his body. According to the
conclusions of philosophy and theology, however, this belief is
erroneous, for spirit first circumscribes an area and then manifests
within it. Philosophically speaking, form, being a part of spirit, is
within spirit; but: spirit is more than the sum of form, As the material
nature of man is therefore within the sum of spirit, so the Universal
Nature, including the entire sidereal system, is within the
all-pervading essence of God--the Universal Spirit.

According to another concept of the ancient wisdom, all bodies--whether
spiritual or material--have three centers, called by the Greeks the
*upper* center, the *middle* center, and the *lower* center. An apparent
ambiguity will here be noted. To diagram or symbolize adequately
abstract mental verities is impossible, for the diagrammatic
representation of one aspect of metaphysical relationships may be an
actual contradiction of some other aspect. While that which

THE TETRAGRAMMATON IN THE HUMAN HEART.  

From Böhme's *Libri Apologetici*.

The Tetragrammaton, or four-lettered Name of God, is here arranged as a
tetractys within the inverted human heart. Beneath, the name *Jehovah*
is shown transformed into *Jehoshua* by the interpolation of the radiant
Hebrew letter סה, *Shin*. The drawing as a whole represents the throne
of God and His hierarchies within the heart of man. In the first book of
his *Libri Apologetici*, Jakob Böhme thus describes the meaning of the
symbol: "For we men have one book in common which points to God. Each
has it within himself, which is the priceless Name of God. Its letters
are the flames of His love, which He out of His heart in the priceless
Name of Jesus has revealed in us. Read these letters in your hearts and
spirits and you have books enough. All the writings of the children of
God direct you unto that one book, for therein lie all the treasures of
wisdom. \* \* \* This book is Christ in you."

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

is above is generally considered superior in dignity and power, in
reality that which is in the center is superior and anterior to both
that which is said to be above and that which is said to be below.
Therefore, it must be said that the first--which is considered as being
above--is actually in the center, while both of the others (which are
said to be either above or below) are actually beneath. This point can
be further simplified if the reader will consider *above* as indicating
degree of proximity to source and *below* as indicating degree of
distance from source, source being posited in the actual center and
relative distance being the various points along the radii from the
center toward the circumference. In matters pertaining to philosophy and
theology, *up* may be considered as toward the center and *down* as
toward the circumference. Center is spirit; circumference is matter.
Therefore, *up* is toward spirit along an ascending scale of
spirituality; *down* is toward matter along an ascending scale of
materiality. The latter concept is partly expressed by the apex of a
cone which, when viewed from above, is seen as a point in the exact
center of the circumference formed by the base of the cone.

These three universal centers--the one above, the one below, and the
link uniting them-represent three suns or three aspects of one
sun--centers of effulgence. These also have their analogues in the three
grand centers of the human body, which, like the physical universe, is a
Demiurgic fabrication. "The first of these \[suns\]," says Thomas
Taylor, "is analogous to light when viewed subsisting in its fountain
the sun; the second to the light immediately proceeding from the sun;
and the third to the splendour communicated to other natures by this
light."

Since the superior (or spiritual) center is in the midst of the other
two, its analogue in the physical body is the heart--the most spiritual
and mysterious organ in the human body. The second center (or the link
between the superior and inferior worlds) is elevated to the position of
greatest physical dignity--the brain. The third (or lower) center is
relegated to the position of least physical dignity but greatest
physical importance--the generative system. Thus the heart is
symbolically the source of life; the brain the link by which, through
rational intelligence, life and form are united; and the generative
system--or infernal creator--the source of that power by which physical
organisms are produced. The ideals and aspirations of the individual
depend largely upon which of these three centers of power predominates
in scope and activity of expression. In the materialist the lower center
is the strongest, in the intellectualist the higher center; but in the
initiate the middle center--by bathing the two extremes in a flood of
spiritual effulgence--controls wholesomely both the mind and the body.

As light bears witness of life-which is its source-so the mind bears
witness of the spirit, and activity in a still lower plane bears witness
of intelligence. Thus the mind bears witness of the heart, while the
generative system, in turn, bears witness of the mind. Accordingly, the
spiritual nature is most commonly symbolized by a heart; the
intellectual power by an opened eye, symbolizing the pineal gland or
Cyclopean eye, which is the two-faced Janus of the pagan Mysteries; and
the generative system by a flower, a staff, a cup, or a hand.

While all the Mysteries recognized the heart as the center of spiritual
consciousness, they often purposely ignored this concept and used the
heart in its exoteric sense as the symbol of the emotional nature, In
this arrangement the generative center represented the physical body,
the heart the emotional body, and the brain the mental body. The brain
represented the superior sphere, but after the initiates had passed
through the lower degrees they were instructed that the brain was the
proxy of the spiritual flame dwelling in the innermost recesses of the
heart. The student of esotericism discovers ere long that the ancients
often resorted to various blinds to conceal the true interpretations of
their Mysteries. The substitution of the brain for the heart was one of
these blinds.

The three degrees of the ancient Mysteries were, with few exceptions,
given in chambers which represented the three great centers of the human
and Universal bodies. If possible, the temple itself was constructed in
the form of the human body. The candidate entered between the feet and
received the highest degree in the point corresponding to the brain.
Thus the first degree was the material mystery and its symbol was the
generative system; it raised the candidate through the various degrees
of concrete thought. The second degree was given in the chamber
corresponding to the heart, but represented the middle power which was
the mental link. Here the candidate was initiated into the mysteries of
abstract thought and lifted as high as the mind was capable of
penetrating. He then passed into the third chamber, which, analogous to
the brain, occupied the highest position in the temple but, analogous to
the heart, was of the greatest dignity. In the brain chamber the heart
mystery was given. Here the initiate for the first time truly
comprehended the meaning of those immortal words: "As a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he." As there are seven hearts in the brain so there
are seven brains in the heart, but this is a matter of superphysics of
which little can be said at the present time.

Proclus writes on this subject in the first book of *On the Theology of
Plato*: "Indeed, Socrates in the (First) Alcibiades rightly observes,
that the soul entering into herself will behold all other things, and
deity itself. For verging to her own union, and to the centre of all
life, laying aside multitude, and the variety of the all manifold powers
which she contains, she ascends to the highest watch-tower offerings.
And as in the most holy of the mysteries, they say, that the mystics at
first meet with the multi form, and many-shaped genera, which are hurled
forth before the gods, but on entering the temple, unmoved, and guarded
by the mystic rites, they genuinely receive in their bosom \[heart\]
divine illumination, and divested of their garments, as they would say,
participate of a divine nature; the same mode, as it appears to me,
takes place in the speculation of wholes. For the soul when looking at
things posterior to herself, beholds the shadows and images of beings,
but when she converts herself to herself she evolves her own essence,
and the reasons which she contains. And at first indeed, she only as it
were beholds herself; but, when she penetrates more profoundly into the
knowledge of herself, she finds in herself both intellect, and the
orders of beings. When however, she proceeds into her interior recesses,
and into the adytum as it were of the soul, she perceives with her eye
closed \[without the aid of the lower mind\], the genus of the gods, and
the unities of beings. For all things are in us psychically, and through
this we are naturally capable of knowing all things, by exciting the
powers and the images of wholes which we contain."

The initiates of old warned their disciples that an image is not a
reality but merely the objectification of a subjective idea. The image,
of the gods were nor designed to be objects of worship but were to be
regarded merely as emblems or reminders of invisible powers and
principles. Similarly, the body of man must not be considered as the
individual but only as the house of the individual, in the same manner
that the temple was the House of God. In a state of grossness and
perversion man's body is the tomb or prison of a divine

HAND DECORATED WITH EFFIGIES OF JESUS CHRIST, THE VIRGIN MARY, AND THE
TWELVE APOSTLES.  

From an old print, courtesy of Carl Oscar Borg.

Upon the twelve phalanges of the fingers, appear the likenesses of the
Apostles, each bearing its own appropriate symbol. In the case of those
who suffered martyrdom the symbol signifies the instrument of death.
Thus, the symbol of St. Andrew is a cross; of St. Thomas, a javelin or a
builder's square; of St. James the Less, a club; of St Philip, a cross;
of St. Bartholomew, a large knife or scimitar; of St. Matthew, a sword
or spear (sometimes a purse); of St. Simon, a club or saw; of St.
Matthias, an axe; and of St. Judas, a halbert. The Apostles whose
symbols do not elate to their martyrdom are St. Peter, who carries two
crossed keys, one gold and one silver; St. James the Great, who bears a
pilgrim's staff and an escalop shell; and St. John, who holds a cup from
which the poison miraculously departed in the form of a serpent. (See
*Handbook of Christian Symbolism*.) The figure of Christ upon the second
phalange of the thumb does not follow the pagan system of assigning the
first Person of the Creative Triad to this Position. God the Father
should occupy the second Phalange, God the Son the first phalange, while
to God the Holy Spirit is assigned the base of the thumb.--Also,
according to the Philosophic arrangement, the Virgin should occupy the
base of the thumb, which is sacred to the moon.

principle; in a state of unfoldment and regeneration it is the House or
Sanctuary of the Deity by whose creative powers it was fashioned.
"Personality is suspended upon a thread from the nature of Being,"
declares the secret work. Man is essentially a permanent and immortal
principle; only his bodies pass through the cycle of birth and death.
The immortal is the reality; the mortal is the unreality. During each
period of earth life, reality thus dwells in unreality, to be liberated
from it temporarily by death and permanently by illumination.

While generally regarded as polytheists, the pagans gained this
reputation not because they worshiped more than one God but rather
because they personified the attributes of this God, thereby creating a
pantheon of posterior deities each manifesting a part of what the One
God manifested as a whole. The various pantheons of ancient religions
therefore actually represent the catalogued and personified attributes
of Deity. In this respect they correspond to the hierarchies of the
Hebrew Qabbalists. All the gods and goddesses of antiquity consequently
have their analogies in the human body, as have also the elements,
planets, and constellations which were assigned as proper vehicles for
these celestials. Four body centers are assigned to the elements, the
seven vital organs to the planets, the twelve principal parts and
members to the zodiac, the invisible parts of man's divine nature to
various supermundane deities, while the hidden God was declared to
manifest through the marrow in the bones.

It is difficult for many to realize that they are actual universes; that
their physical bodies are a visible nature through the structure of
which countless waves of evolving life are unfolding their latent
potentialities. Yet through man's physical body not only are a mineral,
a plant, and an animal kingdom evolving, but also unknown
classifications and divisions of invisible spiritual life. just as cells
are infinitesimal units in the structure of man, so man is an
infinitesimal unit in the structure of the universe. A theology based
upon the knowledge and appreciation of these relationships is as
profoundly just as it is profoundly true.

As man's physical body has five distinct and important extremities--two
legs, two arms, and a head, of which the last governs the first
four--the number 5 has been accepted as the symbol of man. By its four
corners the pyramid symbolizes the arms and legs, and by its apex the
head, thus indicating that one rational power controls four irrational
corners. The hands and feet are used to represent the four elements, of
which the two feet are earth and water, and the two hands fire and air.
The brain then symbolizes the sacred fifth element--æther--which
controls and unites the other four. If the feet are placed together and
the arms outspread, man then symbolizes the cross with the rational
intellect as the head or upper limb.

The fingers and toes also have special significance. The toes represent
the Ten Commandments of the physical law and the fingers the Ten
Commandments of the spiritual law. The four fingers of each hand
represent the four elements and the three phalanges of each finger
represent the divisions of the element, so that in each hand there are
twelve parts to the fingers, which are analogous to the signs of the
zodiac, whereas the two phalanges and base of each thumb signify the
threefold Deity. The first phalange corresponds to the creative aspect,
the second to the preservative aspect, and the base to the generative
and destructive aspect. When the hands are brought together, the result
is the twenty-four Elders and the six Days of Creation.

In symbolism the body is divided vertically into halves, the right half
being considered as light and the left half as darkness. By those
unacquainted with the true meanings of light and darkness the light half
was denominated spiritual and the left half material. Light is the
symbol of objectivity; darkness of subjectivity. Light is a
manifestation of life and is therefore posterior to life. That which is
anterior to light is darkness, in which light exists temporarily but
darkness permanently. As life precedes light, its only symbol is
darkness, and darkness is considered as the veil which must eternally
conceal the true nature of abstract and undifferentiated Being.

In ancient times men fought with their right arms and defended the vital
centers with their left arms, on which was carried the protecting
shield. The right half of the body was regarded therefore as offensive
and the left half defensive. For this reason also the right side of the
body was considered masculine and the left side feminine. Several
authorities are of the opinion that the present prevalent
right-handedness of the race is the outgrowth of the custom of holding
the left hand in restraint for defensive purposes. Furthermore, as the
source of Being is in the primal darkness which preceded light, so the
spiritual nature of man is in the dark part of his being, for the heart
is on the left side.

Among the curious misconceptions arising from the false practice of
associating darkness with evil is one by which several early nations
used the right hand for all constructive labors and the left hand for
only those purposes termed unclean and unfit for the sight of the gods.
For the same reason black magic was often referred to as the left-hand
path, and heaven was said to be upon the right and hell upon the left.
Some philosophers further declared that there were two methods of
writing: one from left to right, which was considered the exoteric
method; the other from right to left, which was considered esoteric. The
exoteric writing was that which was done out or away from the heart,
while the esoteric writing was that which--like the ancient Hebrew--was
written toward the heart.

The secret doctrine declares that every part and member of the body is
epitomized in the brain and, in turn, that all that is in the brain is
epitomized in the heart. In symbolism the human head is frequently used
to represent intelligence and self-knowledge. As the human body in its
entirety is the most perfect known product of the earth's evolution, it
was employed to represent Divinity--the highest appreciable state or
condition. Artists, attempting to portray Divinity, often show only a
hand emerging from an impenetrable cloud. The cloud signifies the
Unknowable Divinity concealed from man by human limitation. The hand
signifies the Divine activity, the only part of God which is cognizable
to the lower senses.

The face consists of a natural trinity: the eyes representing the
spiritual power which comprehends; the nostrils representing the
preservative and vivifying power; and the mouth and ears representing
the material Demiurgic power of the lower world. The first sphere is
eternally existent and is creative; the second sphere pertains to the
mystery of the creative breach; and the third sphere

THE THREEFOLD LIFE OF THE INNER MAN.  

Redrawn from Gichtel's *Theosophia Practica*.

Johann Georg Gichtel, a profound Philosopher and mystic, the most
illumined of the disciples of Jakob Böhme, secretly circulated the above
diagrams among a small group of devoted friends and students. Gichtel
republished the writings of Böhme, illustrating them with numerous
remarkable figures. According to Gichtel, the diagrams above, represent
the anatomy of the divine (or inner) man, and graphically set forth its
condition during its human, infernal, and divine states. The plates in
the William Law edition of Böhme's works are based apparently upon
Gichtel's diagrams, which they follow in all essentials. Gichtel gives
no detailed description of his figures, and the lettering on the
original diagrams here translated out of the German is the only clue to
the interpretation of the charts.

The two end figures represent the obverse and reverse of the same
diagram and are termed Table Three. They are "designed to show the
Condition of the whole Man, as to all his three essential Parts, Spirit,
Soul, and Body, in his Regenerated State." The third figure from the
left is called the Second Table, and sets forth "the Condition of Man in
his old, lapsed, and corrupted State; without any respect to, or
consideration of his renewing by regeneration." The third figure,
however, does not correspond with the First Table of William Law. The
First Table presumably represents the condition of humanity before the
Fall, but the Gichtel plate pertains to the third, or regenerated, state
of mankind. William Law thus describes the purpose of the diagrams, and
the symbols upon them: "These three tables are designed to represent Man
in his different Threefold State: the First before his Fall, in Purity,
Dominion, and Glory: the Second after his Fall, in Pollution and
Perdition: and the Third in his rising from the Fall, or on the Way of
regeneration, in Sanctification and Tendency to his last Perfection."
The student of Orientalism will immediately recognize in the symbols
upon the figures the Hindu *chakras*, or centers of spiritual force, the
various motions and aspects of which reveal the condition of the
disciple's internal divine nature.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

to the creative word. By the Word of God the material universe was
fabricated, and the seven creative powers, or vowel sounds--which had
been brought into existence by the speaking of the Word--became the
seven Elohim or Deities by whose power and ministration the lower world
was organized. Occasionally the Deity is symbolized by an eye, an ear, a
nose, or a mouth. By the first, Divine awareness is signified; by the
second, Divine interest; by the third, Divine vitality; and by the
fourth, Divine command.

The ancients did not believe that spirituality made men either righteous
or rational, but rather that righteousness and rationality made men
spiritual. The Mysteries taught that spiritual illumination was attained
only by bringing the lower nature up to a certain standard of efficiency
and purity. The Mysteries were therefore established for the purpose of
unfolding the nature of man according to certain fixed rules which, when
faithfully followed, elevated the human consciousness to a point where
it was capable of cognizing its own constitution and the true purpose of
existence. This knowledge of how man's manifold constitution could be
most quickly and most completely regenerated to the point of spiritual
illumination constituted the secret, or esoteric, doctrine of antiquity.
Certain apparently physical organs and centers are in reality the veils
or sheaths of spiritual centers. What these were and how they could be
unfolded was never revealed to the unregenerate, for the philosophers
realized that once he understands the complete working of any system, a
man may accomplish a prescribed end without being qualified to
manipulate and control the effects which he has produced. For this
reason long periods of probation were imposed, so that the knowledge of
how to become as the gods might remain the sole possession of the
worthy.

Lest that knowledge be lost, however, it was concealed in allegories and
myths which were meaningless to the profane but self-evident to those
acquainted with that theory of personal redemption which was the
foundation of philosophical theology. Christianity itself may be cited
as an example. The entire New Testament is in fact an ingeniously
concealed exposition of the secret processes of human regeneration. The
characters so long considered as historical men and women are really the
personification of certain processes which take place in the human body
when man begins the task of consciously liberating himself from the
bondage of ignorance and death.

The garments and ornamentations supposedly worn by the gods are also
keys, for in the Mysteries clothing was considered as synonymous with
form. The degree of spirituality or materiality of the organisms was
signified by the quality, beauty, and value of the garments worn. Man's
physical body was looked upon as the robe of his spiritual nature;
consequently, the more developed were his super-substantial powers the
more glorious his apparel. Of course, clothing was originally worn for
ornamentation rather than protection, and such practice still prevails
among many primitive peoples. The Mysteries caught that man's only
lasting adornments were his virtues and worthy characteristics; that he
was clothed in his own accomplishments and adorned by his attainments.
Thus the white robe was symbolic of purity, the red robe of sacrifice
and love, and the blue robe of altruism and integrity. Since the body
was said to be the robe of the spirit, mental or moral deformities were
depicted as deformities of the body.

Considering man's body as the measuring rule of the universe, the
philosophers declared that all things resemble in constitution--if not
in form--the human body. The Greeks, for example, declared Delphi to be
the navel of the earth, for the physical planet was looked upon as a
gigantic human being twisted into the form of a ball. In
contradistinction to the belief of Christendom that the earth is an
inanimate thing, the pagans considered not only the earth but also all
the sidereal bodies as individual creatures possessing individual
intelligences. They even went so far as to view the various kingdoms of
Nature as individual entities. The animal kingdom, for example, was
looked upon as one being--a composite of all the creatures composing
that kingdom. This prototypic beast was a mosaic embodiment of all
animal propensities and within its nature the entire animal world
existed as the human species exists within the constitution of the
prototypic Adam.

In the same manner, races, nations, tribes, religions, states,
communities, and cities were viewed as composite entities, each made up
of varying numbers of individual units. Every community has an
individuality which is the sum of the individual attitudes of its
inhabitants. Every religion is an individual whose body is made up of a
hierarchy and vast host of individual worshipers. The organization of
any religion represents its physical body, and its individual members
the cell life making up this organism. Accordingly, religions, races,
and communities--like individuals--pass through Shakespeare's *Seven
Ages*, for the life of man is a standard by which the perpetuity of all
things is estimated.

According to the secret doctrine, man, through the gradual refinement of
his vehicles and the ever-increasing sensitiveness resulting from that
refinement, is gradually overcoming the limitations of matter and is
disentangling himself from his mortal coil. When humanity has completed
its physical evolution, the empty shell of materiality left behind will
be used by other life waves as steppingstones to their own liberation.
The trend of man's evolutionary growth is ever toward his own essential
Selfhood. At the point of deepest materialism, therefore, man is at the
greatest distance from Himself. According to the Mystery teachings, not
all the spiritual nature of man incarnates in matter. The spirit of man
is diagrammatically shown as an equilateral triangle with one point
downward. This lower point, which is one-third of the spiritual nature
but in comparison to the dignity of the other two is much less than a
third, descends into the illusion of material existence for a brief
space of time. That which never clothes itself in the sheath of matter
is the Hermetic *Anthropos*--the Overman-- analogous to the Cyclops or
guardian *dæmon* of the Greeks, the *angel* of Jakob Böhme, and the
Oversoul of Emerson, "that Unity, that Oversoul, within which every
man's particular being is contained and made one with all other."

At birth only a third part of the Divine Nature of man temporarily
dissociates itself from its own immortality and takes upon itself the
dream of physical birth and existence, animating with its own celestial
enthusiasm a vehicle composed of material elements, part of and bound to
the material sphere. At death this incarnated part awakens from the
dream of physical existence and reunites itself once more with its
eternal condition. This periodical descent of spirit into matter is
termed the *wheel of life and death*, and the principles involved are
treated at length by the philosophers under the subject of
metempsychosis. By initiation into the Mysteries and a certain process
known as operative theology, this law of birth and death is transcended,
and during the course of physical existence that part of the spirit
which is asleep in form is awakened without the intervention of
death--the inevitable Initiator--and is consciously reunited with the
*Anthropos*, or the overshadowing substance of itself. This is at once
the primary purpose and the consummate achievement of the Mysteries:
that man shall become aware of and consciously be reunited with the
divine source of himself without tasting of physical dissolution.

THE DIVINE TREE IN MAN  
(reverse)  

From Law's *Figures* of Jakob Böhme.

Just as the diagram representing the front view of man illustrates his
divine principles in their regenerated state, so the back view of the
same figure sets forth the inferior, or "night," condition of the sun.
From the Sphere of the Astral Mind a line ascends through the Sphere of
reason into that of the Senses. The Sphere of the Astral Mind and of the
Senses are filled with stars to signify the nocturnal condition of their
natures. In the sphere of reason, the superior and the inferior are
reconciled, Reason in the mortal man corresponding to Illumined
Understanding in the spiritual man.

THE DIVINE TREE IN MAN  
(obverse)  

From Law's *Figures* of Jakob Böhme.

A tree with its roots in the heart rises from the Mirror of the Deity
through the Sphere of the Understanding to branch forth in the Sphere of
the Senses. The roots and trunk of this tree represent the divine nature
of man and may be called his *spirituality*; the branches of the tree
are the separate parts of the divine constitution and may be likened to
the individuality; and the leaves--because of their ephemeral
nature--correspond to the *personality*, which partakes of none of the
permanence of its divine source.
