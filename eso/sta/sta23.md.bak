# Stones, Metals and Gems

EACH of the four primary elements as taught by the early philosophers
has its analogue in the quaternary terrestrial constitution of man. The
rocks and earth correspond to the bones and flesh; the water to the
various fluids; the air to the gases; and the fire to the bodily heat.
Since the bones are the framework that sustains the corporeal structure,
they may be regarded as a fitting emblem of the spirit--that divine
foundation which supports the composite fabric of mind, soul, and body.
To the initiate, the skeleton of death holding in bony fingers the
reaper's scythe denotes Saturn (Kronos), the father of the gods,
carrying the sickle with which he mutilated Ouranos, his own sire.

In the language of the Mysteries, *the spirits of men are the powdered
bones of Saturn*. The latter deity was always worshiped under the symbol
of the base or footing, inasmuch as he was considered to be the
substructure upholding creation. The myth of Saturn has its historical
basis in the fragmentary records preserved by the early Greeks and
Phœnicians concerning a king by that name who ruled over the ancient
continent of Hyperborea. Polaris, Hyperborea, and Atlantis, because they
lie buried beneath the continents and oceans of the modern world, have
frequently been symbolized as rocks supporting upon their broad surfaces
new lands, races, and empires. According to the Scandinavian Mysteries,
the stones and cliffs were formed from the bones of Ymir, the primordial
giant of the *seething clay*, while to the Hellenic mystics the rocks
were the bones of the Great Mother, Gæa.

After the deluge sent by the gods to destroy mankind at the close of the
Iron Age, only Deucalion and Pyrrha were left alive. Entering a ruined
sanctuary to pray, they were directed by an oracle to depart from the
temple and with heads veiled and garments unbound cast behind them the
bones of their mother. Construing the cryptic message of the god to mean
that the earth was the Great Mother of all creatures, Deucalion picked
up loose rocks and, bidding Pyrrha do likewise, cast them behind him.
From these rocks there sprang forth a new and stalwart race of human
beings, the rocks thrown by Deucalion becoming men and those thrown by
Pyrrha becoming women. In this allegory is epitomized the mystery of
human evolution; for spirit, by ensouling matter, becomes that
indwelling power which gradually but sequentially raises the mineral to
the status of the plant; the plant to the plane of the animal; the
animal to the dignity of man; and man to the estate of the gods.

The solar system was organized by forces operating inward from the great
ring of the Saturnian sphere; and since the beginnings of all things
were under the control of Saturn, the most reasonable inference is that
the first forms of worship were dedicated to him and his peculiar
symbol--the stone. Thus the intrinsic nature of Saturn is synonymous
with that spiritual rock which is the enduring foundation of the Solar
Temple, and has its antitypc or lower octave in that terrestrial
rock--the planet Earth--which sustains upon its jagged surface the
diversified genera of mundane life.

Although its origin is uncertain, litholatry undoubtedly constitutes one
of the earliest forms of religious expression. "Throughout all the
world, " writes Godfrey Higgins, "the first object of Idolatry seems to
have been a plain, unwrought stone, placed in the ground, as an emblem
of the generative or procreative powers of nature." (See *The Celtic
Druids*.) Remnants of stone worship are distributed over the greater
part of the earth's surface, a notable example being the menhirs at
Carnac, in Brittany, where several thousand gigantic uncut stones are
arranged in eleven orderly rows. Many of these monoliths stand over
twenty feet out of the sand in which they are embedded, and it has been
calculated that some of the larger ones weigh as much as 250,000 pounds.
By some it is believed that certain of the menhirs mark the location of
buried treasure, but the most plausible view is that which regards
Carnac as a monument to the astronomical knowledge of antiquity.
Scattered throughout the British Isles and Europe, these cairns,
dolmens, menhirs, and cistvaens stand as mute but eloquent testimonials
to the existence and achievements of races now extinct.

Of particular interest are the rocking or logan stones, which evince the
mechanical skill of these early peoples. These relics consist of
enormous boulders poised upon one or two small points in such a manner
that the slightest pressure will sway them, but the greatest effort is
not sufficient to overthrow them. These were called *living* stones by
the Greeks and Latins, the most famous one being the Gygorian stone in
the Strait of Gibraltar. Though so perfectly balanced that it could be
moved with the stalk of a daffodil, this rock could not be upset by the
combined weight of many men. There is a legend that Hercules raised a
rocking stone over the graves of the two sons of Boreas whom he had
killed in combat. This stone was so delicately poised that it swayed
back and forth with the wind, but no application of force could overturn
it. A number of logan stones have been found in Britain, traces of one
no longer standing having been discovered in Stonehenge. (See *The
Celtic Druids*.) It is interesting to note that the green stones forming
the inner ring of Stonehenge are believed to have been brought from
Africa.

In many cases the monoliths are without carving or inscription, for they
undoubtedly antedate both the use of tools and the art of writing. In
some instances the stones have been trued into columns or obelisks, as
in the runic monuments and the Hindu *lingams* and *sakti* stones; in
other instances they are fashioned into rough likenesses of the human
body, as in the Easter Island statues, or into the elaborately
sculptured figures of the Central American Indians and the *Khmers* of
Cambodia. The first rough-stone images can hardly be considered as
effigies of any particular deity but rather as the crude effort of
primitive man to portray in the enduring qualities of stone the
procreative attributes of abstract Divinity. An instinctive recognition
of the stability of Deity has persisted through all the intervening ages
between primitive man and modem civilization. Ample proof of the
survival of litholatry in the Christian faith is furnished by allusions
to the *rock of refuge*, the *rock* upon which the church of Christ was
to be founded, the *corner stone* which the builders rejected, Jacob's
*stony pillow* which he set up and anointed with oil, the *sling stone*
of David, the *rock Moriah* upon which the altar of King Solomon's
Temple was erected, the *white stone* of Revelation, and the *Rock of
Ages*.

Stones were highly venerated by prehistoric peoples primarily because of
their usefulness. Jagged bits of stone were probably man's first
weapons; rocky cliffs and crags constituted his first fortifications,
and from these vantage points he hurled loose boulders down upon
marauders. In caverns or rude huts fashioned from slabs of rock the
first humans protected themselves from the rigors of the elements.
Stones were set up as markers and monuments to primitive achievement;
they were also placed upon the graves of the dead, probably as a
precautionary measure to prevent the depredations of wild beasts. During
migrations, it was apparently customary for primitive peoples to carry
about with them stones taken from their original habitat. As the
homeland or birthplace of a race was considered sacred, these stones
were emblematic of that universal regard shared by all nations for the
place of their geniture. The discovery that fire could be produced by
striking together two pieces of stone augmented man's reverence for
stones, but ultimately the hitherto unsuspected world of wonders opened
by the newly discovered element of fire caused pyrolatry to supplant
stone worship. The dark, cold Father--stone--gave birth out of itself to
the bright, glowing Son-fire; and the newly born flame, by displacing
its parent, became the most impressive and mysterious of all
religio-philosophic symbols, widespread and enduring through the ages.

SATURN SWALLOWING THE STONE SUBSTITUTED FOR JUPITER.  

From Catrari's *Imagini degli Dei degli Antichi*.

Saturn, having been warned by his parents that one of his own children
would dethrone him, devoured each child at birth. At last Rhea, his
wife, in order to save Jupiter, her sixth child substituted for him a
rock enveloped in swaddling clothes--which Saturn, ignorant of the
deception practiced upon him, immediately swallowed. Jupiter was
concealed on the island of Crete until he attained manhood, when he
forced his father to disgorge the five children he had eaten. The stone
swallowed by Saturn in lieu of his youngest son was placed by Jupiter at
Delphi, where it was held in great veneration and was daily anointed.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

The *body* of every thing was likened to a rock, trued either into a
cube or more ornately chiseled to form a pedestal, while the spirit of
everything was likened to the elaborately carved figure surmounting it.
Accordingly, altars were erected as a symbol of the lower world, and
fires were kept burning upon them to represent that spiritual essence
illuminating the body it surmounted. The square is actually one surface
of a cube, its corresponding figure in plane geometry, and its proper
philosophic symbol. Consequently, when considering the earth as an
element and not as a body, the Greeks, Brahmins, and Egyptians always
referred to its four corners, although they were fully aware that the
planet itself was a sphere.

Because their doctrines were the sure foundation of all knowledge and
the first step in the attainment of conscious immortality, the Mysteries
were often represented as cubical or pyramidal stones. Conversely, these
stones themselves became the emblem of that condition of self-achieved
godhood. The unchangeability of the stone made it an appropriate emblem
of God--the immovable and unchangeable Source of Existence--and also of
the divine sciences--the eternal revelation of Himself to mankind. As
the personification of the rational intellect, which is the true
foundation of human life, Mercury, or Hermes, was symbolized in a like
manner. Square or cylindrical pillars, surmounted by a bearded head of
Hermes and called hermæ, were set up in public places. Terminus, a form
of Jupiter and god of boundaries and highways, from whose name is
derived the modern word *terminal*, was also symbolized by an upright
stone, sometimes ornamented with the head of the god, which was placed
at the borders of provinces and the intersections of important roads.

The *philosopher's stone* is really the *philosophical stone*, for
philosophy is truly likened to a magic jewel whose touch transmutes base
substances into priceless gems like itself. Wisdom is the alchemist's
*powder of projection* which transforms many thousand times its own
weight of gross ignorance into the precious substance of enlightenment.

### THE TABLETS OF THE LAW

While upon the heights of Mount Sinai, Moses received from Jehovah two
tablets bearing the characters of the Decalogue traced by the very
finger of Israel's God. These tables were fashioned from the divine
sapphire, Schethiyâ, which the Most High, after removing from His own
throne, had cast into the Abyss to become the foundation and generator
of the worlds. This sacred stone, formed of heavenly dew, was sundered
by the breath of God, and upon the two parts were drawn in black fire
the figures of the Law. These precious inscriptions, aglow with
celestial splendor, were delivered by the Lord on the Sabbath day into
the hands of Moses, who was able to read the illumined letters from the
reverse side because of the transparency of the great jewel. (See *The
Secret Doctrine in Israel* or *The Zohar* for details of this legend.)

The Ten Commandments are the ten shining gems placed by the Holy One in
the sapphire sea of Being, and in the depths of matter the reflections
of these jewels are seen as the laws governing the sublunary spheres.
They are the sacred ten by which the Supreme Deity has stamped His will
upon the face of Nature. This same decad was celebrated by the
Pythagoreans under the form of the tetractys--that triangle of spermatic
points which reveals to the initiated the whole working of the cosmic
scheme; for ten is the number of perfection, the key to creation, and
the proper symbol of God, man, and the universe.

Because of the idolatry of the Israelites, Moses deemed the people
unworthy to receive the sapphire tables; hence he destroyed them, that
the Mysteries of Jehovah should not be violated. For the original set
Moses substituted two tablets of rough stone into the surface of which
he had cut ten ancient letters. While the former tables--partaking of
the divinity of the Tree of Life--blazed forth eternal verities, the
latter--partaking of the nature of the Tree of Good and Evil--revealed
only temporal truths. Thus the ancient tradition of Israel returned
again to heaven, leaving only its shadow with the children of the twelve
tribes.

One of the two tables of stone delivered by the Lawgiver to his
followers stood for the oral, the other for the written traditions upon
which the Rabbinical School was founded. Authorities differ widely as to
the size and substance of the inferior tables. Some describe them as
being so small that they could be held in the hollow of a man's hand;
others declare that each table was ten or twelve cubits in length and of
enormous weight. A few even deny that the tables were of stone,
maintaining that they were of a wood called *sedr*, which, according to
the Mohammedans, grows profusely in Paradise.

The two tables signify respectively the superior and the inferior
worlds--the paternal and the maternal formative principles. In their
undivided state they represent the Cosmic Androgyne. The breaking of the
tables signifies obscurely the separation of the superior and the
inferior spheres and also the division of the sexes. In the religious
processionals of the Greeks and Egyptians an ark or ship was carried
which contained stone tablets, cones, and vessels of various shapes
emblematic of the procreative processes. The Ark of the
Israelites--which was patterned after the sacred chests of the Isiac
Mysteries--contained three holy objects, each having an important
phallic interpretation: the pot of manna, the rod that budded, and the
Tablets of the Law--the first, second, and third Principles of the
Creative Triad. The manna, the blossoming staff, and the stone tables
are also appropriate images respectively of the Qabbalah, the Mishna,
and the written law--the spirit, soul, and body of Judaism. When placed
in King Solomon's Everlasting House, the Ark of the Covenant contained
only the Tablets of the Law. Does this indicate that even at that early
date the secret tradition had been lost and the letter of the revelation
alone remained?

As representing the power that fabricated the lower, or Demiurgic,
sphere, the tablets of stone were sacred to Jehovah in contradistinction
to the tablets of sapphire that signified the potency that established
the higher, or celestial, sphere. Without doubt the Mosaic tablets have
their prototype in the stone pillars or obelisks placed on either side
of the entrance to pagan temples. These columns may pertain to that
remote time when men worshiped the Creator through His zodiacal sign of
Gemini, the symbol of which is still the phallic pillars of the
Celestial Twins. "The Ten Commandments, writes Hargrave Jennings, "are
inscribed in two groups of five each, in columnar form. The five to the
right (looking from the altar) mean the 'Law'; the five to the left mean
the 'Prophets.' The right stone is masculine, the left stone is
feminine. They correspond to the two disjoined pillars of stone (or
towers) in the front of every cathedral, and of every temple in the
heathen times." (See *The Rosicrucians: Their Rites and Mysteries*.) The
same author states that the Law is masculine because it was delivered
direct from the Deity, while the Prophets, or Gospels, were feminine
because born through the nature of man.

The right Tablet of the Law further signifies *Jachin*--the white pillar
of light; the left Tablet, *Boaz*--the shadowy pillar of darkness. These
were the names of the two pillars cast from brass set up on the porch of
King Solomon's Temple. They were eighteen cubits in height and
beautifully ornamented with wreaths of chainwork, nets, and
pomegranates. On the top of each pillar was a large bowl--now
erroneously called a ball or globe--one of the bowls probably containing
fire and the other water. The celestial globe (originally the bowl of
fire), surmounting the right-hand column (Jachin), symbolized the divine
man; the terrestrial globe (the bowl of water), surmounting the
left-hand column (Boaz), signified the earthly man. These two pillars
respectively connote also the active and the passive expressions of
Divine Energy, the sun and the moon, sulphur and salt, good and bad,
light and darkness. Between them is the door leading into the House of
God, and standing thus at the gates of Sanctuary they are a reminder
that Jehovah is both an androgynous and an anthropomorphic deity. As two
parallel columns they denote the zodiacal signs of Cancer and Capricorn,
which were formerly placed in the chamber of initiation to represent
birth and death--the extremes of physical life. They accordingly signify
the summer and the winter solstices, now known to Freemasons under the
comparatively modern appellation of the "two St. Johns."

In the mysterious Sephirothic Tree of the Jews, these two pillars
symbolize Mercy and Severity. Standing before the gate of King Solomon's
Temple, these columns had the same symbolic import as the obelisks
before the sanctuaries of Egypt. When interpreted Qabbalistically, the
names of the two pillars mean "In strength shall

MOSES RECEIVING THE TABLES OF THE LAW.  

From an old Bible.

Moses Maimonides, the great Jewish Philosopher of the twelfth century,
in describing the Tables of the Law written by the finger of God,
divides all productions into two general orders: products of Nature and
products of art. God works through Nature and man through art, he
asserts in his *Guide for the Perplexed*. Thus the Word of the Lord is
the hand, or active principle, by which the will of the Creator is
traced upon the face of His creation. The *Tannaim*, or initiates of the
Jewish Mystery School, alone possessed a complete understanding of the
significance of the Ten Commandments. These laws are esoterically
related to the ten degrees of contemplation constituting the Path of
Ecstasy, which winds upward through he four worlds and ends in the
effulgence of *AIN SOPH*.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

\[paragraph continues\] My House be established. "In the splendor of
mental and spiritual illumination, the High Priest stood between the
pillars as a mute witness to the perfect virtue of equilibrium--that
hypothetical point equidistant from all extremes. He thus personified
the divine nature of man in the midst of his compound constitution--the
mysterious Pythagorean Monad in the presence of the Duad. On one side
towered the stupendous column of the intellect; on the other, the brazen
pillar of the flesh. Midway between these two stands the glorified wise
man, but he cannot reach this high estate without first suffering upon
the cross made by joining these pillars together. The early Jews
occasionally represented the two pillars, Jachin and Boaz, as the legs
of Jehovah, thereby signifying to the modern philosopher that Wisdom and
Love, in their most exalted sense, support the whole order of
creation--both mundane and supermundane.

### THE HOLY GRAIL

Like the sapphire Schethiyâ, the *Lapis Exilis*, crown jewel of the
Archangel Lucifer, fell from heaven. Michael, archangel of the sun and
the Hidden God of Israel, at the head of the angelic hosts swooped down
upon Lucifer and his legions of rebellious spirits. During the conflict,
Michael with his flaming sword struck the flashing *Lapis Exilis* from
the coronet of his adversary, and the green stone fell through all the
celestial rings into the dark and immeasurable Abyss. Out of Lucifer's
radiant gem was fashioned the Sangreal, or Holy Grail, from which Christ
is said to have drunk at the Last Supper.

Though some controversy exists as to whether the Grail was a cup or a
platter, it is generally depicted in art as a chalice of considerable
size and unusual beauty. According to the legend, Joseph of Arimathea
brought the Grail Cup to the place of the crucifixion and in it caught
the blood pouring from the wounds of the dying Nazarene. Later Joseph,
who had become custodian of the sacred relics--the Sangreal and the
Spear of Longinus--carried them into a distant country. According to one
version, his descendants finally placed these relics in Glastonbury
Abbey in England; according to another, in a wonderful castle on Mount
Salvat, Spain, built by angels in a single night. Under the name of
Preston John, Parsifal, the last of the Grail Kings, carried the Holy
Cup with him into India, and it disappeared forever from the Western
World. Subsequent search for the Sangreal was the motif for much of the
knight errantry of the Arthurian legends and the ceremonials of the
Round Table. (See the *Morte d'Arthur*.)

No adequate interpretation has ever been given to the Grail Mysteries.
Some believe the Knights of the Holy Grail to have been a powerful
organization of Christian mystics perpetuating the Ancient Wisdom under
the rituals and sacraments of the oracular Cup. The quest for the Holy
Grail is the eternal search for truth, and Albert G. Mackey sees in it a
variation of the Masonic legend of the Lost Word so long sought by the
brethren of the Craft. There is also evidence to support the claim that
the story of the Grail is an elaboration of an early pagan Nature myth
which has been preserved by reason of the subtle manner in which it was
engrafted upon the cult of Christianity. From this particular viewpoint,
the Holy Grail is undoubtedly a type of the ark or vessel in which the
life of the world is preserved and therefore is significant of the body
of the Great Mother--Nature. Its green color relates it to Venus and to
the mystery of generation; also to the Islamic faith, whose sacred color
is green and whose Sabbath is Friday, the day of Venus.

The Holy Grail is a symbol both of the lower (or irrational) world and
of the bodily nature of man, because both are receptacles for the living
essences of the superior worlds. Such is the mystery of the redeeming
blood which, descending into the condition of death, overcomes the last
enemy by ensouling all substance with its own immortality. To the
Christian, whose mystic faith especially emphasizes the love element,
the Holy Grail typifies the heart in which continually swirls the living
water of eternal life. Moreover, to the Christian, the search for the
Holy Grail is the search for the real Self which, when found, is the
consummation of the *magnum opus*.

The Holy Cup can be discovered only by those who have raised themselves
above the limitations of sensuous existence. In his mystic poem, *The
Vision of Sir Launfal*, James Russell Lowell discloses the true nature
of the Holy Grail by showing that it is visible only to a *certain state
of spiritual consciousness*. Only upon returning from the vain pursuit
of haughty ambition did the aged and broken knight see in the
transformed leper's cup the glowing chalice of his lifelong dream. Some
writers trace a similarity between the Grail legend and the stories of
the martyred Sun Gods whose blood, descending from heaven into the
earth, was caught in the cup of matter and liberated therefrom by the
initiatory rites. The Holy Grail may also be the seed pod so frequently
employed in the ancient Mysteries as an emblem of germination and
resurrection; and if the cuplike shape of the Grail be derived from the
flower, it signifies the regeneration and spiritualization of the
generative forces in man.

There are many accounts of stone images which, because of the substances
entering into their composition and the ceremonials attendant upon their
construction, were ensouled by the divinities whom they were created to
resemble. To such images were ascribed various human faculties and
powers, such as speech, thought, and even motion. While renegade priests
doubtless resorted to trickery--an instance of which is related in a
curious apocryphal fragment entitled *Bel and the Dragon* and supposedly
deleted from the end of the *Book of Daniel*--many of the phenomena
recorded in connection with sanctified statues and relics can hardly be
explained unless the work of supernatural agencies be admitted.

History records the existence of stones which, when struck, threw all
who heard the sound into a state of ecstasy. There were also echoing
images which whispered for hours after the room itself had become
silent, and musical stones productive of the sweetest harmonies. In
recognition of the sanctity which the Greeks and Latins ascribed to
stones, they placed their hands upon certain consecrated pillars when
taking an oath. In ancient times stones played a part in determining the
fate of accused persons, for it was customary for juries to reach their
verdicts by dropping pebbles into a bag.

Divination by stones was often resorted to by the Greeks, and Helena is
said to have foretold by lithomancy the destruction of Troy. Many
popular superstitions about stones survive the so-called Dark Ages.
Chief among these is the one concerning the famous black stone in the
seat of the coronation chair in Westminster Abbey, which is declared to
be the actual rock used by Jacob as a pillow. The black stone also
appears several times in religious symbolism. It was called
*Heliogabalus*, a word presumably derived from *Elagabal*, the
Syro-Phœnician sun god. This stone was sacred to the sun and declared to
possess great and diversified properties. The black stone in the Caaba
at Mecca is still revered throughout the Mohammedan world. It is said to
have been white originally and of such brilliancy that it could be seen
many days' journey from Mecca, but as ages passed it became blackened by
the tears of pilgrims and the sins of the world.

### THE MAGIC OF METALS AND GEMS

According to the teachings of the Mysteries, the rays of the celestial
bodies, striking the crystallizing influences of the lower world, become
the various elements. Partaking of the astral virtues of their source,
these elements neutralize certain unbalanced forms of celestial activity
and, when properly combined, contribute much to the well-being of man.
Little is known today concerning these magical properties, but the
modern world may yet find it profitable to consider the findings of the
early philosophers who determined these relationships by extensive
experimentation. Out of such research arose the practice of identifying
the metals with the bones of the various deities. For example, the
Egyptians, according to Manetho, considered iron to be the bone of Mars
and the lodestone the bone of Horus. By analogy, lead would be the
physical skeleton of Saturn, copper of Venus, quicksilver of Mercury,
gold of the sun, silver of the moon, and antimony of the earth. It is
possible that uranium

EXAMPLES OF HERMÆ.  

From Christie's *Disquisitions upon the Painted Greek Vases*.

The Primitive custom of worshiping the gods in the form of heaps of
stones gave place to the practice of erecting phallic pillars, or cones,
in their honor. These columns differed widely in size and appearance.
Some were of gigantic proportions and were richly ornamented with
inscriptions or likenesses of the gods and heroes; others--like the
votive offerings of the Babylonians--were but a few inches high, without
ornament, and merely bore a brief statement of the purpose for which
they had been prepared or a hymn to the god of the temple in which they
were placed. These small baked clay cones were identical in their
symbolic meaning with the large hermæ set up by the roadside and in
other public places. Later the upper end of the column was surmounted by
a human head. Often two projections, or tenons, corresponding to
shoulders were placed, one on either side, to support the wreaths of
flowers adorning the columns. Offerings, usually of food, were placed
near the hermæ. Occasionally these columns were used to uphold roofs and
were numbered among the art objects ornamenting the villas of wealthy
Romans.

will prove to be the metal of Uranus and radium to be the metal of
Neptune.

The four *Ages* of the Greek mystics--the Golden Age, the Silver Age,
the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age--are metaphoric expressions referring
to the four major periods in the life of all things. In the divisions of
the day they signify dawn, midday, sunset, and midnight; in the duration
of gods, men, and universes, they denote the periods of birth, growth,
maturity, and decay. The Greek Ages also bear a close correspondence to
the four Yugas of the Hindus: *Krita-Yuga*, *Treta-Yuga*,
*Dvapara-Yuga*, and *Kali-Yuga*. Their method of calculation is
described by Ullamudeian as follows: "In each of the 12 signs there are
1800 minutes; multiply this number by 12 you have 21600; e.g. 1800 X
12=21600. Multiply this 21600 by 80 and it will give 1,728,000, which is
the duration of the first age, called *Krita-Yuga*. If the same number
be multiplied by 60, it will give 1,296,000, the years of the second
age, *Treta-Yuga*. The same number multiplied by 40 gives 864,000, the
length of the third age, *Dvapara-Yuga*. The same multiplied by 20 gives
432,000, the fourth age, *Kali-Yuga*." (It will be noted that these
multipliers decrease in inverse ratio to the Pythagorean tetractys: 1,
2, 3, and 4.)

H. P. Blavatsky declares that Orpheus taught his followers how to affect
a whole audience by means of a lodestone, and that Pythagoras paid
particular attention to the color and nature of precious stones. She
adds: "The Buddhists assert that the sapphire produces peace of mind,
equanimity, and chases all evil thoughts by establishing a healthy
circulation in man. So does an electric battery, with its well-directed
fluid, say our electricians. 'The sapphire,' say the Buddhists, 'will
open barred doors and dwellings (for the spirit of man); it produces a
desire for prayer, and brings with it more peace than any other gem; but
he who would wear it must lead a pure and holy life."' (See *Isis*
*Unveiled*.)

Mythology abounds with accounts of magical rings and talismanic jewels.
In the second book of his *Republic*, Plato describes a ring which, when
the collet was turned in ward, rendered its wearer invisible. With this
Gyges, the shepherd, secured for himself the throne of Lydia. Josephus
also describes magical rings designed by Moses and King Solomon, and
Aristotle mentions one which brought love and honor to its possessor. In
his chapter dealing with the subject, Henry Cornelius Agrippa not only
mentions the same rings, but states, upon the authority of Philostratus
Jarchus, that Apollonius of Tyana extended his life to over 20 years
with the aid of seven magical rings presented to him by an East Indian
prince. Each of these seven rings was set with a gem partaking of the
nature of one of the seven ruling planets of the week, and by daily
changing the rings Apollonius protected himself against sickness and
death by the intervention of the planetary influences. The philosopher
also instructed his disciples in the virtues of these talismanic jewels,
considering such information to be indispensable to the theurgist.
Agrippa describes the preparation of magical rings as follows: "When any
Star \[planet\] ascends fortunately, with the fortunate aspect or
conjunction of the Moon, we must take a stone and herb that is under
that Star, and make a ring of the metal that is suitable to this Star,
and in it fasten the stone, putting the herb or root under it-not
omitting the inscriptions of images, names, and characters, as also the
proper suffumigations." (See *Three Books of Occult Philosophy*.)

The ring has long been regarded as the symbol of attainment, perfection,
and immortality-the last because the circlet of precious metal had
neither beginning nor end. In the Mysteries, rings chased to resemble a
serpent with its tail in its mouth were worn by the initiates as
material evidence of the position reached by them in the order. Signet
rings, engraved with certain secret emblems, were worn by the
hierophants, and it was not uncommon for a messenger to prove that he
was the official representative of a prince or other dignitary by
bringing with his message either an impression from his master's ring or
the signet itself. The wedding ring originally was intended to imply
that in the nature of the one who wore it the state of equilibrium and
completion had been attained. This plain band of gold therefore bore
witness of the union of the Higher Self (God) with the lower self
(Nature) and the ceremony consummating this indissoluble blending of
Divinity and humanity in the one nature of the initiated mystic
constituted the *hermetic marriage* of the Mysteries.

In describing the regalia of a magician, Eliphas Levi declares that on
Sunday (the day of the sun) he should carry in his right hand a golden
wand, set with a ruby or chrysolite; on Monday (the day of the moon) he
should wear a collar of three strands consisting of pearls, crystals,
and selenites; on Tuesday (the day of Mars) he should carry a wand of
magnetized steel and a ring of the same metal set with an amethyst, on
Wednesday (the day of Mercury) he should wear a necklace of pearls or
glass beads containing mercury, and a ring set with an agate; on
Thursday (the day of Jupiter) he should carry a wand of glass or resin
and wear a ring set with an emerald or a sapphire; on Friday (the day of
Venus) he should carry a wand of polished copper and wear a ring set
with a turquoise and a crown or diadem decorated with lapis lazuli and
beryl; and on Saturday (the day of Saturn) he should carry a wand
ornamented with onyx stone and wear a ring set with onyx and a chain
about the neck formed of lead. (See *The Magical Ritual of the Sanctum
Regnum*.)

Paracelsus, Agrippa, Kircher, Lilly, and numerous other magicians and
astrologers have tabulated the gems and stones corresponding to the
various planets and zodiacal signs. The following list has been compiled
from their writings. To the sun is assigned the carbuncle, ruby,
garnet---especially the pyrope--and other fiery stones, sometimes the
diamond; to the moon, the pearl, selenite, and other forms of crystal;
to Saturn, the onyx, jasper, topaz, and sometimes the lapis lazuli; to
Jupiter, the sapphire, emerald, and marble; to Mars, the amethyst,
hyacinth, lodestone, sometimes the diamond; to Venus, the turquoise,
beryl, emerald, and sometimes the pearl, alabaster, coral, and
carnelian; to Mercury, the chrysolite, agate, and variegated marble.

To the zodiac the same authorities assigned the following gems and
stones: To Aries the sardonyx, bloodstone, amethyst, and diamond; to
Taurus the carnelian, turquoise, hyacinth, sapphire, moss agate, and
emerald; to Gemini the topaz, agate, chrysoprase, crystal, and
aquamarine; to Cancer the topaz, chalcedony, black onyx, moonstone,
pearl, cat's-eye, crystal, and sometimes the emerald; to Leo the jasper,
sardonyx, beryl, ruby, chrysolite, amber, tourmaline, sometimes the
diamond; to Virgo the emerald, camelian, jade, chrysolite, and sometimes
the pink jasper and hyacinth; to Libra the beryl, sardius, coral, lapis
lazuli, opal, and sometimes the diamond; to Scorpio the amethyst, beryl,
sardonyx, aquamarine, carbuncle, lodestone, topaz, and malachite; to
Sagittarius die hyacinth, topaz, chrysolite, emerald, carbuncle, and
turquoise; to Capricorn the chrysoprase, ruby, malachite, black onyx,
white onyx, jet, and moonstone; to Aquarius the crystal, sapphire,
garnet, zircon, and opal; to Pisces the sapphire, jasper, chrysolite,
moonstone, and amethyst

Both the magic mirror and the crystal ball are symbols little
understood. Woe to that benighted mortal who accepts literally the
stories circulated concerning them! He will discover--often at the cost
of sanity and health--that sorcery and philosophy, while often confused,
have nothing in common. The Persian Magi carried mirrors as an emblem of
the material sphere which reflects Divinity from its every part. The
crystal ball, long misused as a medium for the cultivation of psychical
powers, is a threefold symbol: (1) it signifies the crystalline
*Universal Egg* in whose transparent depths creation exists; (2) it is a
proper figure of Deity previous to Its immersion in matter; (3) it
signifies the ætheric sphere of the world in whose translucent essences
is impressed and preserved the perfect image of all terrestrial
activity.

Meteors, or *rocks from heave*n, were considered tokens of divine favor
and enshrined as evidence of a pact between the gods and the community
in which they fell. Curiously marked or chipped natural stones are
occasionally found. In China there is a slab of marble the grain of
which forms a perfect likeness of the Chinese dragon. The Oberammergau
stone, chipped by Nature into a close resemblance to the popular
conception of the face of Christ, is so remarkable that even the crowned
heads of Europe requested the privilege of beholding it. Stones of such
nature were held in the highest esteem among primitive peoples and even
today exert a wide influence upon the religiously-minded.

THE PYTHAGOREAN SIGNET RING.  

From Cartari's *Imagini degli Dei degli Antichi*.

The number five was peculiarly associated by the Pythagoreans with the
art of healing, and the pentagram, or five-pointed star, was to them the
symbol of health. The above figure represents a magical ring set with a
talismanic gem bearing the *pentalpha*, or star formed by five different
positions of the Greek *Alpha*. On this subject Mackey writes: "The
disciples of Pythagoras, who were indeed its real inventors, placed
within each of its interior angles one of the letters of the Greek word
ΥΓΕΙΑ, or the Latin one *SALUS*, both of which signify health; and thus
it was made the talisman of health. They placed it at the beginning of
their epistles as a greeting to invoke a secure health to their
correspondent. But its use was not confined to the disciples of
Pythagoras. As a talisman, it was employed all over the East as a charm
to resist evil spirits."
