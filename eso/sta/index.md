For once, a book which really lives up to its title. Hall self-published
this massive tome in 1928, consisting of about 200 legal-sized pages in
8 point type; it is literally his *magnum opus*. Each of the nearly 50
chapters is so dense with information that it is the equivalent of an
entire short book. If you read this book in its entirety you will be in
a good position to dive into subjects such as the Qabbala, Alchemy,
Tarot, Ceremonial Magic, Neo-Platonic Philosophy, Mystery Religions, and
the theory of Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. Although there are some
questionable and controversial parts of the book, such as the outdated
material on Islam, the portion on the Bacon-Shakespeare hypothesis, and
Hall's conspiracy theory of history as driven by an elite cabal of
roving immortals, they are far out-weighed by the comprehensive
information here on other subjects.

For many years this book was only available in a large format edition
which was hard to obtain and very expensive. However, an affordable
paperback version has finally been released (see sidebar).

PRODUCTION NOTES: I worked on this huge project episodically from 2001
to June 2004. This because of the poor OCR quality, which was due to the
miniscule type and large blocks of italics; this necessitated retyping
many parts of the text manually. To give an idea of how massive this
project was, the proof file for this is 2 megabytes, about 8 times the
size of a normal 200 page book. The raw graphics files are 63 megabytes,
which I've processed down to about 11 megabytes. The thumbnails alone
are 1 megabyte, which is about my graphics budget for a regular book.

While the book itself is not covered by copyright in the US due to lack
of formal renewal, many of the large color illustrations that front each
chapter in the paper edition did have registrations and renewals entered
for them. So these are omitted from this etext. However, all of the
black and white illustrations are included here. Note that many of the
graphics had to be quite large because of the amount of detail, so I
have thumbnailed every image in the book. In the book all of the
illustration captions are in italics; I have reversed this in the etext
for legibility.
