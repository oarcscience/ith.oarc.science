# The Ancient Mysteries and Secret Societies

## Part Three

THE most famous of the ancient religious Mysteries were the Eleusinian,
whose rites were celebrated every five years in the city of Eleusis to
honor Ceres (Demeter, Rhea, or Isis) and her daughter, Persephone. The
initiates of the Eleusinian School were famous throughout Greece for the
beauty of their philosophic concepts and the high standards of morality
which they demonstrated in their daily lives. Because of their
excellence, these Mysteries spread to Rome and Britain, and later the
initiations were given in both these countries. The Eleusinian
Mysteries, named for the community in Attica where the sacred dramas
were first presented, are generally believed to have been founded by
Eumolpos about fourteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, and
through the Platonic system of philosophy their principles have been
preserved to modern times.

The rites of Eleusis, with their Mystic interpretations of Nature's most
precious secrets, overshadowed the civilizations of their time and
gradually absorbed many smaller schools, incorporating into their own
system whatever valuable information these lesser institutions
possessed. Heckethorn sees in the Mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus a
metamorphosis of the rites of Isis and Osiris, and there is every reason
to believe that all so-called secret schools of the ancient world were
branches from one philosophic tree which, with its root in heaven and
its branches on the earth, is--like the spirit of man--an invisible but
ever-present cause of the objectified vehicles that give it expression.
The Mysteries were the channels through which this one philosophic light
was disseminated, and their initiates, resplendent with intellectual and
spiritual understanding, were the perfect fruitage of the divine tree,
bearing witness before the material world of the recondite source of all
Light and Truth.

The rites of Eleusis were divided into what were called the Lesser and
the Greater Mysteries. According to James Gardner, the Lesser Mysteries
were celebrated in the spring (probably at the time of the vernal
equinox) in the town of Agræ, and the Greater, in the fall (the time of
the autumnal equinox) at Eleusis or Athens. It is supposed that the
former were given annually and the latter every five years. The rituals
of the Eleusinians were highly involved, and to understand them required
a deep study of Greek mythology, which they interpreted in its esoteric
light with the aid of their secret keys.

The Lesser Mysteries were dedicated to Persephone. In his *Eleusinian
and Bacchic Mysteries*, Thomas Taylor sums up their purpose as follows:
"The Lesser Mysteries were designed by the ancient theologists, their
founders, to signify occultly the condition of the unpurified soul
invested with an earthy body, and enveloped in a material and physical
nature."

The legend used in the Lesser rites is that of the abduction of the
goddess Persephone, the daughter of Ceres, by Pluto, the lord of the
underworld, or Hades. While Persephone is picking flowers in a beautiful
meadow, the earth suddenly opens and the gloomy lord of death, riding in
a magnificent chariot, emerges from its somber depths and, grasping her
in his arms, carries the screaming and struggling goddess to his
subterranean palace, where he forces her to become his queen.

It is doubtful whether many of the initiates themselves understood the
mystic meaning of this allegory, for most of them apparently believed
that it referred solely to the succession of the seasons. It is
difficult to obtain satisfactory information concerning the Mysteries,
for the candidates were bound by inviolable oaths never to reveal their
inner secrets to the profane. At the beginning of the ceremony of
initiation, the candidate stood upon the skins of animals sacrificed for
the purpose, and vowed that death should seal his lips before he would
divulge the sacred truths which were about to be communicated to him.
Through indirect channels, however, some of their secrets have been
preserved. The teachings given to the neophytes were substantially as
follows:

The soul of man--often called *Psyche*, and in the Eleusinian Mysteries
symbolized by Persephone--is essentially a spiritual thing. Its true
home is in the higher worlds, where, free from the bondage of material
form and material concepts, it is said to be truly alive and
self-expressive. The human, or physical, nature of man, according to
this doctrine, is a tomb, a quagmire, a false and impermanent thing, the
source of all sorrow and suffering. Plato describes the body as the
sepulcher of the soul; and by this he means not only the human form but
also the human nature.

The gloom and depression of the Lesser Mysteries represented the agony
of the spiritual soul unable to express itself because it has accepted
the limitations and illusions of the human environment. The crux of the
Eleusinian argument was that man is neither better nor wiser after death
than during life. If he does not rise above ignorance during his sojourn
here, man goes at death into eternity to wander about forever, making
the same mistakes which he made here. If he does not outgrow the desire
for material possessions here, he will carry it with him into the
invisible world, where, because he can never gratify the desire, he will
continue in endless agony. Dante's *Inferno* is symbolically descriptive
of the sufferings of those who never freed their spiritual natures from
the cravings, habits, viewpoints, and limitations of their Plutonic
personalities. Those who made no endeavor to improve themselves (whose
souls have slept) during their physical lives, passed at death into
Hades, where, lying in rows, they slept through all eternity as they had
slept through life.

To the Eleusinian philosophers, birch into the physical world was death
in the fullest sense of the word, and the only true birth was that of
the spiritual soul of man rising out of the womb of his own fleshly
nature. "The soul is dead that slumbers," says Longfellow, and in this
he strikes the keynote of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Just as Narcissus,
gazing at himself in the water (the ancients used this mobile element to
symbolize the transitory, illusionary, material universe) lost his life
trying to embrace a reflection, so man, gazing into the mirror of Nature
and accepting as his real self the senseless clay that he sees
reflected, loses the opportunity afforded by physical life to unfold his
immortal, invisible Self.

An ancient initiate once said that the living are ruled by the dead.
Only those conversant with the Eleusinian concept of life could
understand that statement. It means that the majority of people are not
ruled by their living spirits but by their senseless (hence dead) animal
personalities. Transmigration and reincarnation were taught in these
Mysteries, but in a somewhat unusual manner. It was believed that at
midnight the invisible worlds were closest to the Terrestrial sphere and
that souls coming into material existence slipped in during the midnight
hour. For this reason many of the Eleusinian

[![THE RAPE OF PERSEPHONE.](tn/02900.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/02900.jpg.md)  
THE RAPE OF PERSEPHONE.  

From Thomassin's *Recucil des Figures, Groupes, Themes, Fontaines, Vases
et autres Ornements*.

Pluto, the lord of the underworld, represents the body intelligence of
man; and the rape of Persephone is symbolic of the divine nature
assaulted and defiled by the animal soul and dragged downward into the
somber darkness of Hades, which is here used as a synonym for the
material, or objective, sphere of consciousness.

In his *Disquisitions upon the Painted Greek Vases*, James Christie
presents Meursius' version of the occurrences taking place during the
nine days required for the enactment of the Greater Eleusinian Rites.
The first day was that of general meeting, during which those to be
initiated were questioned concerning their several qualifications. The
second day was spent in a procession to the sea, possibly for the
submerging of a image of the presiding goddess. The third day was opened
by the sacrifice of a mullet. On the fourth day the mystic basket
containing certain sacred symbols was brought to Eleusis, accompanied by
a number of female devotees carrying smaller baskets. On the evening of
the fifth day there was a torch race, on the sixth a procession led by a
statue of Iacchus, and on the seventh an athletic contest. The eighth
day was devoted to a repetition of the ceremonial for the benefit of any
who might have been prevented from coming sooner. The ninth and last day
was devoted to the deepest philosophical issues of the Eleusinia, during
which an urn or jar--the symbol of Bacchus--was exhibited as an emblem
of supreme importance.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

ceremonies were performed at midnight. Some of those sleeping spirits
who had failed to awaken their higher natures during the earth life and
who now floated around in the invisible worlds, surrounded by a darkness
of their own making, occasionally slipped through at this hour and
assumed the forms of various creatures.

The mystics of Eleusis also laid stress upon the evil of suicide,
explaining that there was a profound mystery concerning this crime of
which they could not speak, but warning their disciples that a great
sorrow comes to all who take their own lives. This, in substance,
constitutes the esoteric doctrine given to the initiates of the Lesser
Mysteries. As the degree dealt largely with the miseries of those who
failed to make the best use of their philosophic opportunities, the
chambers of initiation were subterranean and the horrors of Hades were
vividly depicted in a complicated ritualistic drama. After passing
successfully through the tortuous passageways, with their trials and
dangers, the candidate received the honorary title of *Mystes*. This
meant one who saw through a veil or had a clouded vision. It also
signified that the candidate had been brought up to the veil, which
would be torn away in the higher degree. The modern word *mystic*, as
referring to a seeker after truth according to the dictates of the heart
along the path of faith, is probably derived from this ancient word, for
faith is belief in the reality of things unseen or veiled.

The Greater Mysteries (into which the candidate was admitted only after
he had successfully passed through the ordeals of the Lesser, and not
always then) were sacred to Ceres, the mother of Persephone, and
represent her as wandering through the world in quest of her abducted
daughter. Ceres carried two torches, intuition and reason, to aid her in
the search for her lost child (the soul). At last she found Persephone
not far from Eleusis, and out of gratitude taught the people there to
cultivate corn, which is sacred to her. She also founded the Mysteries.
Ceres appeared before Pluto, god of the souls of the dead, and pleaded
with him to allow Persephone to return to her home. This the god at
first refused to do, because Persephone had eaten of the pomegranate,
the fruit of mortality. At last, however, he compromised and agreed to
permit Persephone to live in the upper world half of the year if she
would stay with him in the darkness of Hades for the remaining half.

The Greeks believed that Persephone was a manifestation of the solar
energy, which in the winter months lived under the earth with Pluto, but
in the summer returned again with the goddess of productiveness. There
is a legend that the flowers loved Persephone and that every year when
she left for the dark realms of Pluto, the plants and shrubs would die
of grief. While the profane and uninitiated had their own opinions on
these subjects, the truths of the Greek allegories remained safely
concealed by the priests, who alone recognized the sublimity of these
great philosophic and religious parables.

Thomas Taylor epitomizes the doctrines of the Greater Mysteries in the
following statement: "The Greater (Mysteries) obscurely intimated, by
mystic and splendid visions, the felicity of the soul both here and
hereafter when purified from the defilement of a material nature, and
constantly elevated to the realities of intellectual (spiritual)
vision."

Just as the Lesser Mysteries discussed the prenatal epoch of man when
the consciousness in its nine days (embryologically, months) was
descending into the realm of illusion and assuming the veil of
unreality, so the Greater Mysteries discussed the principles of
spiritual regeneration and revealed to initiates not only the simplest
but also the most direct and complete method of liberating their higher
natures from the bondage of material ignorance. Like Prometheus chained
to the top of Mount Caucasus, man's higher nature is chained to his
inadequate personality. The nine days of initiation were also symbolic
of the nine spheres through which the human soul descends during the
process of assuming a terrestrial form. The secret exercises for
spiritual unfoldment given to disciples of the higher degrees are
unknown, but there is every reason to believe that they were similar to
the Brahmanic Mysteries, since it is known that the Eleusinian
ceremonies were closed with the Sanskrit words "Konx Om Pax."

That part of the allegory referring to the two six-month periods during
one of which Persephone must remain with Pluto, while during the other
she may revisit the upper world, offers material for deep consideration.
It is probable that the Eleusinians realized that the soul left the body
during steep, or at least was made capable of leaving by the special
training which undoubtedly they were in a position to give. Thus
Persephone would remain as the queen of Pluto's realm during the waking
hours, but would ascend to the spiritual worlds during the periods of
sleep. The initiate was taught how to intercede with Pluto to permit
Persephone (the initiate's soul) to ascend from the darkness of his
material nature into the light of understanding. When thus freed from
the shackles of clay and crystallized concepts, the initiate was
liberated not only for the period of his life but for all eternity, for
never thereafter was he divested of those soul qualities which after
death were his vehicles for manifestation and expression in the
so-called heaven world.

In contrast to the idea of Hades as a state of darkness below, the gods
were said to inhabit the tops of mountains, a well-known example being
Mount Olympus, where the twelve deities of the Greek pantheon were said
to dwell together. In his initiatory wanderings the neophyte therefore
entered chambers of ever-increasing brilliancy to portray the ascent of
the spirit from the lower worlds into the realms of bliss. As the climax
to such wanderings he entered a great vaulted room, in the center of
which stood a brilliantly illumined statue of the goddess Ceres. Here,
in the presence of the hierophant and surrounded by priests in
magnificent robes, he was instructed in the highest of the secret
mysteries of the Eleusis. At the conclusion of this ceremony he was
hailed as an *Epoptes*, which means one who has beheld or seen directly.
For this reason also initiation was termed *autopsy*. The Epoptes was
then given certain sacred books, probably written in cipher, together
with tablets of stone on which secret instructions were engraved.

In *The Obelisk in Freemasonry*, John A. Weisse describes the
officiating personages of the Eleusinian Mysteries as consisting of a
male and a female hierophant who directed the initiations; a male and a
female torchbearer; a male herald; and a male and a female altar
attendant. There were also numerous minor officials. He states that,
according to Porphyry, the hierophant represents Plato's *Demiurgus*, or
Creator of the world; the torch bearer, the Sun; the altar man, the
Moon; the herald, Hermes, or Mercury; and the other officials, minor
stars.

From the records available, a number of strange and apparently
supernatural phenomena accompanied the rituals. Many initiates claim to
have actually seen the living gods themselves. Whether this was the
result of religious ecstasy or the actual cooperation of invisible
powers with the visible priests must remain a mystery. In *The
Metamorphosis, or Golden Ass*, Apuleius thus describes what in all
probability is his initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries:

"I approached to the confines of death, and having trod on the threshold
of Proserpine I, returned from it, being carried through all the
elements. At midnight I saw the sun shining with a splendid light; and I
manifestly drew near to, the gods beneath, and the gods above, and
proximately adored them."

Women and children were admitted to the Eleusinian Mysteries, and at one
time there were literally thousands of initiates. Because this vast host
was not prepared for the highest spiritual and mystical doctrines, a
division necessarily took place within the society itself. The higher
teachings were given to only a limited number of initiates who, because
of superior mentality, showed a comprehensive grasp of their underlying
philosophical concepts. Socrates refused to be initiated into the
Eleusinian Mysteries, for knowing its principles without being a member
of the order he realized that membership would seal his tongue. That the
Mysteries of Eleusis were based upon great and eternal truths is
attested by the veneration in which they were held by the great minds of
the ancient world. M. Ouvaroff asks, "Would Pindar, Plato, Cicero,
Epictetus, have spoken of them with such admiration, if the hierophant
had satisfied himself with loudly proclaiming his own opinions, or those
of his order?"

The garments in which candidates were initiated were preserved for many
years and were believed to possess almost sacred properties. Just as the
soul can have no covering save wisdom and virtue, so the
candidates--being as yet without true knowledge--were presented to the
Mysteries unclothed, being first: given the skin of an animal and later
a consecrated robe to symbolize the philosophical teachings received by
the initiate. During the course of initiation the candidate

From a mural painting in Pompeii.

Ceres, or Demeter, was the daughter of Kronos and Rhea, and by Zeus the
mother of Persephone. Some believe her to be the goddess of the earth,
but more correctly she is the deity protecting agriculture in general
and corn in particular. The Poppy is sacred to Ceres and she is often
shown carrying or ornamented by a garland of these flowers. In the
Mysteries, Ceres represented riding in a chariot drawn by winged
serpents.

[![THE PROCESSIONAL OF THE BACCHIC RITES.](tn/03100.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/03100.jpg.md)  
THE PROCESSIONAL OF THE BACCHIC RITES.  

From Ovid's *Metamorphosis*.

In the initiation, of the Bacchic Mysteries, the rôle of Bacchus is
played by the candidate who, set upon by priests in the guise of the
Titans, is slain and finally restored to life amidst great rejoicing.
The Bacchic Mysteries were given every three years, and like the
Eleusinian Mysteries, were divided into two degrees. The initiates were
crowned with myrtle and ivy, plants which were sacred to Bacchus.

In the *Anacalypsis*, Godfrey Higgins conclusively establishes Bacchus
(Dionysos) as one of the early pagan forms of the Christos myth, "The
birthplace of Bacchus, called Sabazius or Sabaoth, was claimed by
several places in Greece; but on Mount Zelmisus, in Thrace, his worship
seems to have been chiefly celebrated. He was born of a virgin on the
25th of December; he performed great miracles for the good of mankind;
particularly one in which he changed water into wine; he rode in a
triumphal procession on an ass; he was put to death by the Titans, and
rose again from the dead on the 25th of March: he was always called the
Saviour. In his mysteries, he was shown to the people, as an infant is
by the Christians at this day, on Christmas Day morning in Rome."

While Apollo most generally represents the sun, Bacchus is also a form
of solar energy, for his resurrection was accomplished with the
assistance of Apollo. The resurrection of Bacchus signifies merely the
extraction or disentanglement of the various Parts of the Bacchic
constitution from the Titanic constitution of the world. This is
symbolized by the smoke or soot rising from the burned bodies of the
Titans. The soul is symbolized by smoke because it is extracted by the
fire of the Mysteries. Smoke signifies the ascension of the soul, far
evolution is the process of the soul rising, like smoke, from the
divinely consumed material mass. At me time the Bacchic Rites were of a
high order, but later they became much degraded . The Bacchanalia, or
orgies of Bacchus, are famous in literature.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

passed through two gates. The first led downward into the lower worlds
and symbolized his birth into ignorance. The second led upward into a
room brilliantly lighted by unseen lamps, in which was the statue of
Ceres and which symbolized the upper world, or the abode of Light and
Truth. Strabo states that the great temple of Eleusis would hold between
twenty and thirty thousand people. The caves dedicated by Zarathustra
also had these two doors, symbolizing the avenues of birth and death.

The following paragraph from Porphyry gives a fairly adequate conception
of Eleusinian symbolism: "God being a luminous principle, residing in
the midst of the most subtile fire, he remains for ever invisible to the
eyes of those who do not elevate themselves above material life: on this
account, the sight of transparent bodies, such as crystal, Parian
marble, and even ivory, recalls the idea of divine light; as the sight
of gold excites an idea of its purity, for gold cannot he sullied. Some
have thought by a black stone was signified the invisibility of the
divine essence. To express supreme reason, the Divinity was represented
under the human form--and beautiful, for God is the source of beauty; of
different ages, and in various attitudes, sitting or upright; of one or
the other sex, as a virgin or a young man, a husband or a bride, that
all the shades and gradations might be marked. Every thing luminous was
subsequently attributed to the gods; the sphere, and all that is
spherical, to the universe, to the sun and the moon--sometimes to
Fortune and to Hope. The circle, and all circular figures, to
eternity--to the celestial movements; to the circles and zones of the
heavens. The section of circles, to the phases of the moon; and pyramids
and obelisks, to the igneous principle, and through that to the gods of
Heaven. A cone expresses the sun, a cylinder the earth; the phallus and
triangle (a symbol of the matrix) designate generation." (From *Essay on
the Mysteries of Eleusis* by M. Ouvaroff.)

The Eleusinian Mysteries, according to Heckethorn, survived all others
and did not cease to exist as an institution until nearly four hundred
years after Christ, when they were finally suppressed by Theodosius
(styled the Great), who cruelly destroyed all who did not accept the
Christian faith. Of this greatest of all philosophical institutions
Cicero said that it taught men not only how to live but also how to die.

### THE ORPHIC MYSTERIES

Orpheus, the Thracian bard, the great initiator of the Greeks, ceased to
be known as a man and was celebrated as a divinity several centuries
before the Christian Era. "As to Orpheus himself \* \* \*, " writes
Thomas Taylor, "scarcely a vestige of his life is to be found amongst
the immense ruins of time. For who has ever been able to affirm any
thing with certainty of his origin, his age, his country, and condition?
This alone may be depended on, from general assent, that there formerly
lived a person named Orpheus, who was the founder of theology among the
Greeks; the institutor of their lives and morals; the first of prophets,
and the prince of poets; himself the offspring of a Muse; who taught the
Greeks their sacred rites and mysteries, and from whose wisdom, as from
a perennial and abundant fountain, the divine muse of Homer and the
sublime theology of Pythagoras and Plato flowed." (See *The Mystical
Hymns of Orpheus*.)

Orpheus was founder of the Grecian mythological system which he used as
the medium for the promulgation of his philosophical doctrines. The
origin of his philosophy is uncertain. He may have got it from the
Brahmins, there being legends to the effect that he got it was a Hindu,
his name possibly being derived from ὀρφανῖος, meaning "dark." Orpheus
was initiated into the Egyptian Mysteries, from which he secured
extensive knowledge of magic, astrology, sorcery, and medicine. The
Mysteries of the Cabiri at Samothrace were also conferred upon him, and
these undoubtedly contributed to his knowledge of medicine and music.

The romance of Orpheus and Eurydice is one of the tragic episodes of
Greek mythology and apparently constitutes the outstanding feature

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

of the Orphic Rite. Eurydice, in her attempt to escape from a villain
seeking to seduce her, died from the venom of a poisonous serpent which
stung her in the heel. Orpheus, penetrating to the very heart of the
underworld, so charmed Pluto and Persephone with the beauty of his music
that they agreed to permit Eurydice to return to life if Orpheus could
lead her back to the sphere of the living without once looking round to
see if she were following. So great was his fear, however, that she
would stray from him that he turned his head, and Eurydice with a
heartbroken cry was swept back into the land of death.

Orpheus wandered the earth for a while disconsolate, and there are
several conflicting accounts of the manner of his death. Some declare
that he was slain by a bolt of lightning; others, that failing to save
his beloved Eurydice, he committed suicide. The generally accepted
version of his death, however, is that he was torn to pieces by Ciconian
women whose advances he had spurned. In the tenth book of Plato's
*Republic* it is declared that, because of his sad fate at the hands of
women, the soul that had once been Orpheus, upon being destined to live
again in the physical world, chose rather to return in the body of a
swan than be born of woman. The head of Orpheus, after being torn from
his body, was cast with his lyre into the river Hebrus, down which it
floated to the sea, where, wedging in a cleft in a rock, it gave oracles
for many years. The lyre, after being stolen from its shrine and working
the destruction of the thief, was picked up by the gods and fashioned
into a constellation.

Orpheus has long been sung as the patron of music. On his seven-stringed
lyre he played such perfect harmonies that the gods themselves were
moved to acclaim his power. When he touched the strings of his
instrument the birds and beasts gathered about him, and as he wandered
through the forests his enchanting melodies caused even the ancient
trees with mighty effort to draw their gnarled roots from out the earth
and follow him. Orpheus is one of the many Immortals who have sacrificed
themselves that mankind might have the wisdom of the gods. By the
symbolism of his music he communicated the divine secrets to humanity,
and several authors have declared that the gods, though loving him,
feared that he would overthrow their kingdom and therefore reluctantly
encompassed his destruction.

As time passed on the historical Orpheus became hopelessly confounded
with the doctrine he represented and eventually became the symbol of the
Greek school of the ancient wisdom. Thus Orpheus was declared to be the
son of Apollo, the divine and perfect truth, and Calliope, the Muse of
harmony and rhythm. In other words, Orpheus is the secret doctrine
(Apollo) revealed through music (Calliope). Eurydice is humanity dead
from the sting of the serpent of false knowledge and imprisoned in the
underworld of ignorance. In this allegory Orpheus signifies theology,
which wins her from the king of the dead but fails to accomplish her
resurrection because it falsely estimates and mistrusts the innate
understanding within the human soul. The Ciconian women who tore Orpheus
limb from limb symbolize the various contending theological factions
which destroy the body of Truth. They cannot accomplish this, however,
until their discordant cries drown out the harmony drawn by Orpheus from
his magic lyre. The head of Orpheus signifies the esoteric doctrines of
his cult. These doctrines continue to live and speak even after his body
(the cult) has been destroyed. The lyre is the secret teaching of
Orpheus; the seven strings are the seven divine truths which are the
keys to universal knowledge. The differing accounts of his death
represent the various means used to destroy the secret teachings: wisdom
can die in many ways at the same time. The allegory of Orpheus
incarnating in the white swan merely signifies that the spiritual truths
he promulgated will continue and will be taught by the illumined
initiates of all future ages. The swan is the symbol of the initiates of
the Mysteries; it is a symbol also of the divine power which is the
progenitor of the world.

### THE BACCHIC AND DIONYSIAC RITES

The Bacchic Rite centers around the allegory of the youthful Bacchus
(Dionysos or Zagreus) being torn to pieces by the Titans. These giants
accomplished the destruction of Bacchus by causing him to become
fascinated by his own image in a mirror. After dismembering him, the
Titans first boiled the pieces in water and afterwards roasted them.
Pallas rescued the heart of the murdered god, and by this precaution
Bacchus (Dionysos) was enabled to spring forth again in all his former
glory. Jupiter, the Demiurgus, beholding the crime of the Titans, hurled
his thunderbolts and slew them, burning their bodies to ashes with
heavenly fire. Our of the ashes of the Titans--which also contained a
portion of the flesh of Bacchus, whose body they had partly
devoured--the human race was created. Thus the mundane life of every man
was said to contain a portion of the Bacchic life.

For this reason the Greek Mysteries warned against suicide. He who
attempts to destroy himself raises his hand against the nature of
Bacchus within him, since man's body is indirectly the tomb of this god
and consequently must be preserved with the greatest care.

Bacchus (Dionysos) represents the rational soul of the inferior world.
He is the chief of the Titans--the artificers of the mundane spheres.
The Pythagoreans called him the *Titanic monad*. Thus Bacchus is the
all-inclusive idea of the Titanic sphere and the Titans--or *gods of the
fragments*--the active agencies by means of which universal substance is
fashioned into the pattern of this idea. The Bacchic state signifies the
unity of the rational soul in a state of self-knowledge, and the Titanic
state the diversity of the rational soul which, being scattered
throughout creation, loses the consciousness of its own essential
one-ness. The mirror into which Bacchus gazes and which is the cause of
his fall is the great sea of illusion--the lower world fashioned by the
Titans. Bacchus (the mundane rational soul), seeing his image before
him, accepts the image as a likeness of himself and ensouls the
likeness; that is, the rational idea ensouls its reflection--the
irrational universe. By ensouling the irrational image it implants in it
the urge to become like its source, the rational image. Therefore the
ancients said that man does not know the gods by logic or by reason but
rather by realizing the presence of the gods within himself.

After Bacchus gazed into the mirror and followed his own reflection into
matter, the rational soul of the world was broken up and distributed by
the Titans throughout the mundane sphere of which it is the essential
nature, but the heart, or source, of it they could not: scatter. The
Titans took the dismembered body of Bacchus and boiled it in
water--symbol of immersion in the material universe--which represents
the incorporation of the Bacchic principle in form. The pieces were
afterwards roasted to signify the subsequent ascension of the spiritual
nature out of form.

When Jupiter, the father of Bacchus and the Demiurgus of the universe,
saw that the Titans were hopelessly involving the rational or divine
idea by scattering its members through the constituent parts of the
lower world, he slew the Titans in order that the divine idea might not
be entirely lost. From the ashes of the Titans he formed mankind, whose
purpose of existence was to preserve and eventually to release the
Bacchic idea, or rational soul, from the Titanic fabrication. Jupiter,
being the Demiurgus and fabricator of the material universe, is the
third person of the Creative Triad, consequently the Lord of Death, for
death exists only in the lower sphere of being over which he presides.
Disintegration takes place so that reintegration may follow upon a
higher level of form or intelligence. The thunderbolts of Jupiter are
emblematic of his disintegrative power; they reveal the purpose of
death, which is to rescue the rational soul from the devouring power of
the irrational nature.

Man is a composite creature, his lower nature consisting of the
fragments of the Titans and his higher nature the sacred, immortal flesh
(life) of Bacchus. Therefore man is capable of either a Titanic
(irrational) or a Bacchic (rational) existence. The Titans of Hesiod,
who were twelve in number, are probably analogous to the celestial
zodiac, whereas the Titans who murdered and dismembered Bacchus
represent the zodiacal powers distorted by their involvement in the
material world. Thus Bacchus represents the sun who is dismembered by
the signs of the zodiac and from whose body the universe is formed. When
the terrestrial forms were created from the various parts of his body
the sense of wholeness was lost and the sense of separateness
established. The heart of Bacchus, which was saved by Pallas, or
Minerva, was lifted out of the four elements symbolized by his
dismembered body and placed in the ether. The heart of Bacchus is the
immortal center of the rational soul.

After the rational soul had been distributed throughout creation and the
nature of man, the Bacchic Mysteries were instituted for the purpose of
disentangling it from the irrational Titanic nature. This
disentanglement was the process of lifting the soul out of the state of
separateness into that of unity. The various parts and members of
Bacchus were collected from the different corners of the earth. When all
the rational parts are gathered Bacchus is resurrected.

The Rites of Dionysos were very similar to those of Bacchus, and by many
these two gods are considered as one. Statues of Dionysos were carried
in the Eleusinian Mysteries, especially the lesser degrees. Bacchus,
representing the soul of the mundane sphere, was capable of an infinite
multiplicity of form and designations. Dionysos apparently was his solar
aspect.

The Dionysiac Architects constituted an ancient secret society, in
principles and doctrines much like the modern Freemasonic Order. They
were an organization of builders bound together by their secret
knowledge of the relationship between the earthly and the divine
sciences of architectonics. They were supposedly employed by King
Solomon in the building of his Temple, although they were not Jews, nor
did they worship the God of the Jews, being followers of Bacchus and
Dionysos. The Dionysiac Architects erected many of the great monuments
of antiquity. They possessed a secret language and a system of marking
their stones. They had annual convocations and sacred feasts. The exact
nature of their doctrines is unknown. It is believed that CHiram Abiff
was an initiate of this society.
