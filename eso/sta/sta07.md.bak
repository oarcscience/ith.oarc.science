# Atlantis and the Gods of Antiquity

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

ATLANTIS is the subject of a short but important article appearing in
the Annual Report of the Board of Regents of The Smithsonian Institution
for the year ending June 30th, 1915. The author, M. Pierre Termier, a
member of the Academy of Sciences and Director of Service of the
Geologic Chart of France, in 1912 delivered a lecture on the Atlantean
hypothesis before the Institut Océanographique; it is the translated
notes of this remarkable lecture that are published in the Smithsonian
report.

"After a long period of disdainful indifference," writes M. Termier,
"observe how in the last few years science is returning to the study of
Atlantis. How many naturalists, geologists, zoologists, or botanists are
asking one another today whether Plato has not transmitted to us, with
slight amplification, a page from the actual history of mankind. No
affirmation is yet permissible; but it seems more and more evident that
a vast region, continental or made up of great islands, has collapsed
west of the Pillars of Hercules, otherwise called the Strait of
Gibraltar, and that its collapse occurred in the not far distant past.
In any event, the question of Atlantis is placed anew before men of
science; and since I do not believe that it can ever be solved without
the aid of oceanography, I have thought it natural to discuss it here,
in this temple of maritime science, and to call to such a problem, long
scorned but now being revived, the attention of oceanographers, as well
as the attention of those who, though immersed in the tumult of cities,
lend an ear to the distant murmur of the sea."

In his lecture M. Termier presents geologic, geographic, and zoologic
data in substantiation of the Atlantis theory. Figuratively draining the
entire bed of the Atlantic Ocean, he considers the inequalities of its
basin and cites locations on a line from the Azores to Iceland where
dredging has brought lava to the surface from a depth of 3,000 meters.
The volcanic nature of the islands now existing in the Atlantic Ocean
corroborates Plato's statement that the Atlantean continent was
destroyed by volcanic cataclysms. M. Termier also advances the
conclusions of a young French zoologist, M. Louis Germain, who admitted
the existence of an Atlantic continent connected with the Iberian
Peninsula and with Mauritania and prolonged toward the south so as to
include some regions of desert climate. M. Termier concludes his lecture
with a graphic picture of the engulfment of that continent.

The description of the Atlantean civilization given by Plato in the
*Critias* may be summarized as follows. In the first ages the gods
divided the earth among themselves, proportioning it according to their
respective dignities. Each became the peculiar deity of his own
allotment and established therein temples to himself, ordained a
priestcraft, and instituted a system of sacrifice. To Poseidon was given
the sea and the island continent of Atlantis. In the midst of the island
was a mountain which was the dwelling place of three earth-born
primitive human beings--Evenor; his wife, Leucipe; and their only
daughter, Cleito. The maiden was very beautiful, and after the sudden
death of her parents she was wooed by Poseidon, who begat by her five
pairs of male children. Poseidon apportioned his continent among these
ten, and Atlas, the eldest, he made overlord of the other nine. Poseidon
further called the country *Atlantis* and the surrounding sea the
*Atlantic* in honor of Atlas. Before the birth of his ten sons, Poseidon
divided the continent and the coastwise sea into concentric zones of
land and water, which were as perfect as though turned upon a lathe. Two
zones of land and three of water surrounded the central island, which
Poseidon caused to be irrigated with two springs of water--one warm and
the other cold.

The descendants of Atlas continued as rulers of Atlantis, and with wise
government and industry elevated the country to a position of surpassing
dignity. The natural resources of Atlantis were apparently limitless.
Precious metals were mined, wild animals domesticated, and perfumes
distilled from its fragrant flowers. While enjoying the abundance
natural to their semitropic location, the Atlanteans employed themselves
also in the erection of palaces, temples, and docks. They bridged the
zones of sea and later dug a deep canal to connect the outer ocean with
the central island, where stood the palaces And temple of Poseidon,
which excelled all other structures in magnificence. A network of
bridges and canals was created by the Atlanteans to unite the various
parts of their kingdom.

Plato then describes the white, black, and red stones which they
quarried from beneath their continent and used in the construction of
public buildings and docks. They circumscribed each of the land zones
with a wall, the outer wall being covered with brass, the middle with
tin, and the inner, which encompassed the citadel, with orichalch. The
citadel, on the central island, contained the pal aces, temples, and
other public buildings. In its center, surrounded by a wall of gold, was
a sanctuary dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon. Here the first ten princes
of the island were born and here each year their descendants brought
offerings. Poseidon's own temple, its exterior entirely covered with
silver and its pinnacles with gold, also stood within the citadel. The
interior of the temple was of ivory, gold, silver, and orichalch, even
to the pillars and floor. The temple contained a colossal statue of
Poseidon standing in a chariot drawn by six winged horses, about him a
hundred Nereids riding on dolphins. Arranged outside the building were
golden statues of the first ten kings and their wives.

In the groves and gardens were hot and cold springs. There were numerous
temples to various deities, places of exercise for men and for beasts,
public baths, and a great race course for horses. At various vantage
points on the zones were fortifications, and to the great harbor came
vessels from every maritime nation. The zones were so thickly populated
that the sound of human voices was ever in the air.

That part of Atlantis facing the sea was described as lofty and
precipitous, but about the central city was a plain sheltered by
mountains renowned for their size, number, and beauty. The plain yielded
two crops each year,, in the winter being watered by rains and in the
summer by immense irrigation canals, which were also used for
transportation. The plain was divided into sections, and in time of war
each section supplied its quota of fighting men and chariots.

The ten governments differed from each other in details concerning
military requirements. Each of the kings of Atlantis had complete
control over his own kingdom, but their mutual relationships were
governed by a code engraved by the first ten kings on a column' of
orichalch standing in the temple of Poseidon. At alternate intervals of
five and six years a pilgrimage was made to this temple that equal honor
might be conferred upon both the odd and the even numbers. Here, with
appropriate sacrifice, each king renewed his

THE SCHEME OF THE UNIVERSE ACCORDING TO THE GREEKS AND ROMANS.  

From Cartari's *Imagini degli Dei degli Antichi*.

By ascending successively through the fiery sphere of Hades, the spheres
of water, Earth, and air, and the heavens of the moon, the plane of
Mercury is reached. Above Mercury are the planes of Venus, the sun,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the latter containing the symbols of the
Zodiacal constellations. Above the arch of the heavens (Saturn) is the
dwelling Place of the different powers controlling the universe. The
supreme council of the gods is composed of twelve deities--six male and
six female--which correspond to the positive and negative signs of the
zodiac. The six gods are Jupiter, Vulcan, Apollo, Mars, Neptune, and
Mercury; the six goddesses are Juno, Ceres, Vesta, Minerva, Venus, and
Diana. Jupiter rides his eagle as the symbol of his sovereignty over the
world, and Juno is seated upon a peacock, the proper symbol of her
haughtiness and glory.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

oath of loyalty upon the sacred inscription. Here also the kings donned
azure robes and sat in judgment. At daybreak they wrote their sentences
upon a golden tablet: and deposited them with their robes as memorials.
The chief laws of the Atlantean kings were that they should not take up
arms against each other and that they should come to the assistance of
any of their number who was attacked. In matters of war and great moment
the final decision was in the hands of the direct descendants of the
family of Atlas. No king had the power of life and death over his
kinsmen without the assent of a majority of the ten.

Plato concludes his description by declaring that it was this great
empire which attacked the Hellenic states. This did not occur, however,
until their power and glory had lured the Atlantean kings from the
pathway of wisdom and virtue. Filled with false ambition, the rulers of
Atlantis determined to conquer the entire world. Zeus, perceiving the
wickedness of the Atlanteans, gathered the gods into his holy habitation
and addressed them. Here Plato's narrative comes to an abrupt end, for
the *Critias* was never finished. In the *Timæus* is a further
description of Atlantis, supposedly given to Solon by an Egyptian priest
and which concludes as follows:

"But afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods; and in a
single day and night of rain all your warlike men in a body sank into
the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like manner disappeared, and
was sunk beneath the sea. And that is the reason why the sea in those
parts is impassable and impenetrable, because there is such a quantity
of shallow mud in the way; and this was caused by the subsidence of the
island."

In the introduction to his translation of the *Timæus*, Thomas Taylor
quotes from a *History of Ethiopia* written by Marcellus, which contains
the following reference to Atlantis: "For they relate that in their time
there were seven islands in the Atlantic sea, sacred to Proserpine; and
besides these, three others of an immense magnitude; one of which was
sacred to Pluto, another to Ammon, and another, which is the middle of
these, and is of a thousand stadia, to Neptune." Crantor, commenting
upon Plato, asserted that the Egyptian priests declared the story of
Atlantis to be written upon pillars which were still preserved circa 300
B.C. (See *Beginnings or Glimpses of Vanished Civilizations*.) Ignatius
Donnelly, who gave the subject of Atlantis profound study, believed that
horses were first domesticated by the Atlanteans, for which reason they
have always been considered peculiarly sacred to Poseidon. (See
*Atlantis*.)

From a careful consideration of Plato's description of Atlantis it is
evident that the story should not be regarded as wholly historical but
rather as both allegorical and historical. Origen, Porphyry, Proclus,
Iamblichus, and Syrianus realized that the story concealed a profound
philosophical mystery, but they disagreed as to the actual
interpretation. Plato's Atlantis symbolizes the threefold nature of both
the universe and the human body. The ten kings of Atlantis are the
*tetractys*, or numbers, which are born as five pairs of opposites.
(Consult Theon of Smyrna for the Pythagorean doctrine of opposites.) The
numbers 1 to 10 rule every creature, and the numbers, in turn, are under
the control of the Monad, or 1--the Eldest among them.

With the trident scepter of Poseidon these kings held sway over the
inhabitants of the seven small and three great islands comprising
Atlantis. Philosophically, the ten islands symbolize the triune powers
of the Superior Deity and the seven regents who bow before His eternal
throne. If Atlantis be considered as the archetypal sphere, then its
immersion signifies the descent of rational, organized consciousness
into the illusionary, impermanent realm of irrational, mortal ignorance.
Both the sinking of Atlantis and the Biblical story of the "fall of man"
signify spiritual involution--a prerequisite to conscious evolution.

Either the initiated Plato used the Atlantis allegory to achieve two
widely different ends or else the accounts preserved by the Egyptian
priests were tampered with to perpetuate the secret doctrine. This does
not mean to imply that Atlantis is purely mythological, but it overcomes
the most serious obstacle to acceptance of the Atlantis theory, namely,
the fantastic accounts of its origin, size, appearance, and date of
destruction--9600 B.C. In the midst of the central island of Atlantis
was a lofty mountain which cast a shadow five thousand stadia in extent
and whose summit touched the sphere of *æther*. This is the axle
mountain of the world, sacred among many races and symbolic of the human
head, which rises out of the four elements of the body. This sacred
mountain, upon whose summit stood the temple of the gods, gave rise to
the stories of Olympus, Meru, and Asgard. The City of the Golden
Gates--the capital of Atlantis--is the one now preserved among numerous
religions as the *City of the Gods* or the *Holy City*. Here is the
archetype of the New Jerusalem, with its streets paved with gold and its
twelve gates shining with precious stones.

"The history of Atlantis," writes Ignatius Donnelly, "is the key of the
Greek mythology. There can be no question that these gods of Greece were
human beings. The tendency to attach divine attributes to great earthly
rulers is one deeply implanted in human nature." (See *Atlantis*.)

The same author sustains his views by noting that the deities of the
Greek pantheon were nor looked upon as creators of the universe but
rather as regents set over it by its more ancient original fabricators.
The Garden of Eden from which humanity was driven by a flaming sword is
perhaps an allusion to the earthly paradise supposedly located west of
the Pillars of Hercules and destroyed by volcanic cataclysms. The Deluge
legend may be traced also to the Atlantean inundation, during which a
"world" was destroyed by water.,

Was the religious, philosophic, and scientific knowledge possessed by
the priestcrafts of antiquity secured from Atlantis, whose submergence
obliterated every vestige of its part in the drama of world progress?
Atlantean sun worship has been perpetuated in the ritualism and
ceremonialism of both Christianity and pagandom. Both the cross and the
serpent were Atlantean emblems of divine wisdom. The divine (Atlantean)
progenitors of the Mayas and Quichés of Central America coexisted within
the green and azure radiance of Gucumatz, the "plumed" serpent. The six
sky-born sages came into manifestation as centers of light bound
together or synthesized by the seventh--and chief--of their order, the
"feathered" snake. (See the *Popol Vuh*.) The title of "winged" or
"plumed" snake was applied to Quetzalcoatl, or Kukulcan, the Central
American initiate. The center of the Atlantean Wisdom-Religion was
presumably a great pyramidal temple standing on the brow of a plateau
rising in the midst of the City of the Golden Gates. From here the
Initiate-Priests of the Sacred Feather went forth, carrying the keys of
Universal Wisdom to the uttermost parts of the earth.

The mythologies of many nations contain accounts of gods who "came out
of the sea." Certain *shamans* among the American Indians tell of holy
men dressed in birds' feathers and wampum who rose out of the blue
waters and instructed them in the arts and crafts. Among the legends of
the Chaldeans is that of Oannes, a partly amphibious creature who came
out of the sea and taught the savage peoples along the shore to read and
write, till the soil, cultivate herbs for healing, study the stars,
establish rational forms of government, and become conversant with the
sacred Mysteries. Among the Mayas, Quetzalcoatl, the Savior-God (whom
some Christian scholars believe to have been St. Thomas), issued from
the waters and, after instructing the people in the essentials of
civilization, rode out to sea on a magic raft of serpents to escape the
wrath of the fierce god of the Fiery Mirror, Tezcatlipoca.

May it not have been that these demigods of a fabulous age who,
Esdras-like, came out of the sea were Atlantean priests? All that
primitive man remembered of the Atlanteans was the glory of their golden
ornaments, the transcendency of their wisdom, and the sanctity of their
symbols--the cross and the serpent. That they came in ships was soon
forgotten, for untutored minds considered even boats as supernatural.
Wherever the Atlanteans proselyted they erected pyramids and temples
patterned after the great sanctuary in the City of the Golden Gates.
Such is the origin of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, and Central
America. The mounds in Normandy and Britain, as well as those of the
American Indians, are remnants of a similar culture. In the midst of the
Atlantean program of world colonization and conversion, the cataclysms
which sank Atlantis began. The Initiate-Priests of the Sacred Feather
who promised to come back to their missionary settlements never
returned; and after the lapse of centuries tradition preserved only a
fantastic account of gods who came from a place where the sea now is.

H. P. Blavatsky thus sums up the causes which precipitated the Atlantean
disaster: "Under the evil insinuations of their demon, Thevetat, the
Atlantis-race became a nation of wicked *magicians*. In consequence of
this, war was declared, the story of which would be too long to narrate;
its substance may be found in the disfigured allegories of the race of
Cain, the giants, and that of Noah and his righteous family. The
conflict came to an end by the submersion of the Atlantis; which finds
its imitation in the stories of the Babylonian and Mosaic flood: The
giants and magicians '\* \* \* and all flesh died \* \* \* and every
man.' All except Xisuthrus and Noah, who are substantially identical
with the great Father of the Thlinkithians in the *Popol Vuh*, or the
sacred book of the Guatemaleans, which also tells of his escaping in a
large boat, like the Hindu Noah--Vaiswasvata. " (See *Isis Unveiled*.)

From the Atlanteans the world has received not only the heritage of arts
and crafts, philosophies and sciences, ethics and religions, but also
the heritage of hate, strife, and perversion. The Atlanteans instigated
the first war; and it has been said that all subsequent wars were fought
in a fruitless effort to justify the first one and right the wrong which
it caused. Before Atlantis sank, its spiritually illumined Initiates,
who realized that their land was doomed because it had departed from the
Path of Light, withdrew from the ill-fated continent. Carrying with them
the sacred and secret doctrine, these Atlanteans

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

established themselves in Egypt, where they became its first "divine"
rulers. Nearly all the great cosmologic myths forming the foundation of
the various sacred books of the world are based upon the Atlantean
Mystery rituals.

### THE MYTH OF THE DYING GOD

The myth of *Tammuz* and *Ishtar* is one of the earliest examples of the
dying-god allegory, probably antedating 4000 B. C. (See *Babylonia and
Assyria* by Lewis Spence.) The imperfect condition of the tablets upon
which the legends are inscribed makes it impossible to secure more than
a fragmentary account of the Tammuz rites. Being the esoteric god of the
sun, Tammuz did not occupy a position among the first deities venerated
by the Babylonians, who for lack of deeper knowledge looked upon him as
a god of agriculture or a vegetation spirit. Originally he was described
as being one of the guardians of the gates of the underworld. Like many
other Savior-Gods, he is referred to as a "shepherd" or "the lord of the
shepherd seat." Tammuz occupies the remarkable position of son and
husband of Ishtar, the Babylonian and Assyrian Mother-goddess.
Ishtar--to whom the planer Venus was sacred--was the most widely
venerated deity of the Babylonian and Assyrian pantheon. She was
probably identical with Ashterorh, Astarte, and Aphrodite. The story of
her descent into the underworld in search presumably for the sacred
elixir which alone could restore Tammuz to life is the key to the ritual
of her Mysteries. Tammuz, whose annual festival took place just before
the summer solstice, died in midsummer in the ancient month which bore
his name, and was mourned with elaborate ceremonies. The manner of his
death is unknown, but some of the accusations made against Ishtar by
Izdubar (Nimrod) would indicate that she, indirectly at least, had
contributed to his demise. The resurrection of Tammuz was the occasion
of great rejoicing, at which time he was hailed as a "redeemer" of his
people.

With outspread wings, Ishtar, the daughter of Sin (the Moon), sweeps
downward to the gates of death. The house of darkness--the dwelling of
the god Irkalla--is described as "the place of no return." It is without
light; the nourishment of those who dwell therein is dust and their food
is mud. Over the bolts on the door of the house of Irkalla is scattered
dust, and the keepers of the house are covered with feathers like birds.
Ishtar demands that the keepers open the gates, declaring that if they
do not she will shatter the doorposts and strike the hinges and raise up
dead devourers of the living. The guardians of the gates beg her to be
patient while they go to the queen of Hades from whom they secure
permission to admit Ishtar, but only in the same manner as all others
came to this dreary house. Ishtar thereupon descends through the seven
gates which lead downward into the depths of the underworld. At the
first gate the great crown is removed from her head, at the second gate
the earrings from her ears, at the third gate the necklace from her
neck, at the fourth gate the ornaments from her breast, at the fifth
gate the girdle from her waist, at the sixth gate the bracelets from her
hands and feet, and at the seventh gate the covering cloak of her body.
Ishtar remonstrates as each successive article of apparel is taken from
her, bur the guardian tells her that this is the experience of all who
enter the somber domain of death. Enraged upon beholding Ishtar, the
Mistress of Hades inflicts upon her all manner of disease and imprisons
her in the underworld.

As Ishtar represents the spirit of fertility, her loss prevents the
ripening of the crops and the maturing of all life upon the earth.

In this respect the story parallels the legend of Persephone. The gods,
realizing that the loss of Ishtar is disorganizing all Nature, send a
messenger to the underworld and demand her release. The Mistress of
Hades is forced to comply, and the water of life is poured over Ishtar.
Thus cured of the infirmities inflicted on her, she retraces her way
upward through the seven gates, at each of which she is reinvested with
the article of apparel which the guardians had removed. (See *The
Chaldean Account of Genesis*.) No record exists that Ishtar secured the
water of life which would have wrought the resurrection of Tammuz.

The myth of Ishtar symbolizes the descent of the human spirit through
the seven worlds, or spheres of the sacred planets, until finally,
deprived of its spiritual adornments, it incarnates in the physical
body--Hades--where the mistress of that body heaps every form of sorrow
and misery upon the imprisoned consciousness. The waters of life--the
secret doctrine--cure the diseases of ignorance; and the spirit,
ascending again to its divine source, regains its God-given adornments
as it passes upward through the rings of the planets.

Another Mystery ritual among the Babylonians and Assyrians was that of
Merodach and the Dragon. Merodach, the creator of the inferior universe,
slays a horrible monster and out of her body forms the universe. Here is
the probable source of the so-called Christian allegory of St. George
and the Dragon.

The Mysteries of *Adonis*, or *Adoni*, were celebrated annually in many
parts of Egypt, Phœnicia, and Biblos. The name *Adonis*, or *Adoni*,
means "Lord" and was a designation applied to the sun and later borrowed
by the Jews as the exoteric name of their God. Smyrna, mother of Adonis,
was turned into a tree by the gods and after a time the bark burst open
and the infant Savior issued forth. According to one account, he was
liberated by a wild boar which split the wood of the maternal tree with
its tusks. Adonis was born at midnight of the 24th of December, and
through his unhappy death a Mystery rite was established that wrought
the salvation of his people. In the Jewish month of Tammuz (another name
for this deity) he was gored to death by a wild boar sent by the god Ars
(Mars). The *Adoniasmos* was the ceremony of lamenting the premature
death of the murdered god.

In Ezekiel viii. 14, it is written that women were weeping for Tammuz
(Adonis) at the north gate of the Lord's House in Jerusalem. Sir James
George Frazer cites Jerome thus: "He tells us that Bethlehem, the
traditionary birthplace of the Lord, was shaded by a grove of that still
older Syrian Lord, Adonis, and that where the infant Jesus had wept, the
lover of Venus was bewailed." (See *The Golden Bough*.) The effigy of a
wild boar is said to have been set over one of the gates of Jerusalem in
honor of Adonis, and his rites celebrated in the grotto of the Nativity
at Bethlehem. Adonis as the "gored" (or "god") man is one of the keys to
Sir Francis Bacon's use of the "wild boar" in his cryptic symbolism.

Adonis was originally an androgynous deity who represented the solar
power which in the winter was destroyed by the evil principle of
cold--the boar. After three days (months) in the tomb, Adonis rose
triumphant on the 25th day of March, amidst the acclamation of his
priests and followers, "He is risen!" Adonis was born out of a myrrh
tree. Myrrh, the symbol of death because of its connection with the
process of embalming, was one of the gifts brought by the three Magi to
the manger of Jesus.

In the Mysteries of Adonis the neophyte passed through the symbolic
death of the god and, "raised" by the priests, entered into the blessed
state of redemption made possible by the sufferings of Adonis. Nearly
all authors believe Adonis to have been originally a vegetation god
directly connected with the growth and maturing of flowers

[![THE GREAT GOD PAN.](tn/03500.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/03500.jpg.md)  
THE GREAT GOD PAN.  

From Kircher's *Œdipus Ægyptiacus*.

The great Pan was celebrated as the author and director of the sacred
dances which he is supposed to have instituted to symbolize the
circumambulations of the heavenly bodies. Pan was a composite creature,
the upper part--with the exception of his horns--being human, and the
lower part in the form of a goat. Pan is the prototype of natural energy
and, while undoubtedly a phallic deity, should nor be confused with
Priapus. The pipes of Pan signify the natural harmony of the spheres,
and the god himself is a symbol of Saturn because this planet is
enthroned in Capricorn, whose emblem is a goat. The Egyptians were
initiated into the Mysteries of Pan, who was regarded as a phase of
Jupiter, the Demiurgus. Pan represented the impregnating power of the
sun and was the chief of a horde rustic deities, and satyrs. He also
signified the controlling spirit of the lower worlds. The fabricated a
story to the effect that at the time of the birth of Christ the oracles
were silenced after giving utterance to one last cry, "Great Pan is
dead!"

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

and fruits. In support of this viewpoint they describe the "gardens of
Adonis, " which were small baskets of earth in which seeds were planted
and nurtured for a period of eight days. When those plants prematurely
died for lack of sufficient earth, they were considered emblematic of
the murdered Adonis and were usually cast into the sea with images of
the god.

In Phrygia there existed a remarkable school of religious philosophy
which centered around the life and untimely fate of another Savior-God
known as *Atys*, or *Attis*, by many considered synonymous with Adonis.
This deity was born at midnight on the 24th day of December. Of his
death there are two accounts. In one he was gored to death like Adonis;
in the other he emasculated himself under a pine tree and there died.
His body was taken to a cave by the Great Mother (Cybele), where it
remained through the ages without decaying. To the rites of Atys the
modern world is indebted for the symbolism of the Christmas tree. Atys
imparted his immortality to the tree beneath which he died, and Cybele
took the tree with her when she removed the body. Atys remained three
days in the tomb, rose upon a date corresponding with Easter morn, and
by this resurrection overcame death for all who were initiated into his
Mysteries.

"In the Mysteries of the Phrygians, "says Julius Firmicus, "which are
called those of the MOTHER OF THE GODS, every year a PINE TREE is cut
down and in the inside of the tree the image of a YOUTH is tied in! In
the Mysteries of Isis the trunk of a PINE TREE is cut: the middle of the
trunk is nicely hollowed out; the idol of Osiris made from those
hollowed pieces is BURIED. In the Mysteries of Proserpine a tree cut is
put together into the effigy and form of the VIRGIN, and when it has
been carried within the city it is MOURNED 40 nights, but the fortieth
night it is BURNED!" (See Sod, *the Mysteries of Adoni*.)

The Mysteries of Atys included a sacramental meal during which the
neophyte ate out of a drum and drank from a cymbal. After being baptized
by the blood of a bull, the new initiate was fed entirely on milk to
symbolize that he was still a philosophical infant, having but recently
been born out of the sphere of materiality. (See Frazer's *The Golden
Bough*.) Is there a possible connection between this lacteal diet
prescribed by the Attic rite and St. Paul's allusion to the food for
spiritual babes? Sallust gives a key to the esoteric interpretation of
the Attic rituals. Cybele, the Great Mother, signifies the vivifying
powers of the universe, and Atys that aspect of the spiritual intellect
which is suspended between the divine and animal spheres. The Mother of
the gods, loving Atys, gave him a starry hat, signifying celestial
powers, but Atys (mankind), falling in love with a nymph (symbolic of
the lower animal propensities), forfeited his divinity and lost his
creative powers. It is thus evident that Atys represents the human
consciousness and that his Mysteries are concerned with the reattainment
of the starry hat. (See *Sallust on the Gods and the World*.)

The rites of *Sabazius* were very similar to those of Bacchus and it is
generally believed that the two deities are identical. Bacchus was born
at Sabazius, or Sabaoth, and these names are frequently assigned to him.
The Sabazian Mysteries were performed at night, and the ritual included
the drawing of a live snake across the breast of the candidate. Clement
of Alexandria writes: "The token of the Sabazian Mysteries to the
initiated is 'the deity gliding over the breast.'" A golden serpent was
the symbol of Sabazius because this deity represented the annual
renovation of the world by the solar power. The Jews borrowed the name
Sabaoth from these Mysteries and adopted it as one of the appellations
of their supreme God. During the time the Sabazian Mysteries were
celebrated in Rome, the cult gained many votaries and later influenced
the symbolism of Christianity.

The Cabiric Mysteries of Samothrace were renowned among the ancients,
being next to the Eleusinian in public esteem. Herodotus declares that
the Samothracians received their doctrines, especially those concerning
Mercury, from the Pelasgians. Little is known concerning the Cabiric
rituals, for they were enshrouded in the profoundest secrecy. Some
regard the Cabiri as seven in number and refer to them as "the Seven
Spirits of fire before the throne of Saturn." Others believe the Cabiri
to be the seven sacred wanderers, later called the planets.

While a vast number of deities are associated with the Samothracian
Mysteries, the ritualistic drama centers around four brothers. The first
three--Aschieros, Achiochersus, and Achiochersa--attack and murder the
fourth--Cashmala (or Cadmillus). Dionysidorus, however, identifies
Aschieros with Demeter, Achiochersus with Pluto, Achiochersa with
Persephone, and Cashmala with Hermes. Alexander Wilder notes that in the
Samothracian ritual "Cadmillus is made to include the Theban
Serpent-god, Cadmus, the Thoth of Egypt, the Hermes of the Greeks, and
the Emeph or Æsculapius of the Alexandrians and Phœnicians. " Here again
is a repetition of the story of Osiris, Bacchus, Adonis, Balder, and
Hiram Abiff. The worship of Atys and Cybele was also involved in the
Samothracian Mysteries. In the rituals of the Cabiri is to be traced a
form of pine-tree worship, for this tree, sacred to Atys, was first
trimmed into the form of a cross and then cut down in honor of the
murdered god whose body was discovered at its foot.

"If you wish to inspect the orgies of the Corybantes, " writes Clement,
"Then know that, having killed their third brother, they covered the
head of the dead body with a purple cloth, crowned it, and carrying it
on the point of a spear, buried it under the roots of Olympus. These
mysteries are, in short, murders and funerals. \[This ante-Nicene Father
in his efforts to defame the pagan rites apparently ignores the fact
that, like the Cabirian martyr, Jesus Christ was foully betrayed,
tortured, and finally murdered!\] And the priests Of these rites, who
are called kings of the sacred rites by those whose business it is to
name them, give additional strangeness to the tragic occurrence, by
forbidding parsley with the roots from being placed on the table, for
they think that parsley grew from the Corybantic blood that flowed
forth; just as the women, in celebrating the Thcsmophoria, abstain from
eating the seeds of the pomegranate, which have fallen on the ground,
from the idea that pomegranates sprang from the drops of the blood of
Dionysus. Those Corybantes also they call Cabiric; and the ceremony
itself they announce as the Cabiric mystery."

The Mysteries of the Cabiri were divided into three degrees, the first
of which celebrated the death of Cashmala, at the hands of his three
brothers; the second, the discovery of his mutilated body, the parts of
which had been found and gathered after much labor; and the
third--accompanied by great rejoicing and happiness--his resurrection
and the consequent salvation of the world. The temple of the Cabiri at
Samothrace contained a number of curious divinities, many of them
misshapen creatures representing the elemental powers of Nature,
possibly the Bacchic Titans. Children were initiated into the Cabirian
cult with the same dignity as adults, and criminals who reached the
sanctuary were safe from pursuit. The Samothracian rites were
particularly concerned with navigation, the Dioscuri--Castor and Pollux,
or the gods of navigation--being among those propitiated by members of
that cult. The Argonautic expedition, listening to the advice of
Orpheus, stopped at the island of Samothrace for the purpose of having
its members initiated into the Cabiric rites.

Herodotus relates that when Cambyses entered the temple of the Cabiri he
was unable to restrain his mirth at seeing before him the figure of a
man standing upright and, facing the man, the figure of a woman standing
on her head. Had Cambyses been acquainted with the principles of divine
astronomy, he would have realized that he was then in the presence of
the key to universal equilibrium. "'I ask,' says Voltaire, 'who were
these Hierophants, these sacred Freemasons, who celebrated their Ancient
Mysteries of Samothracia, and whence came they and their gods Cabiri?'"
(See Mackey's *Encyclopædia of Freemasonry*.) Clement speaks of the
Mysteries of the Cabiri as "the sacred Mystery of a brother slain by his
brethren," and the "Cabiric death" was one of the secret symbols of
antiquity. Thus the allegory of the Self murdered by the not-self is
perpetuated through the religious mysticism of all peoples. The
*philosophic death* and the *philosophic resurrection* are the Lesser
and the Greater Mysteries respectively.

A curious aspect of the *dying-god* myth is that of the Hanged Man. The
most important example of this peculiar conception is found in the
Odinic rituals where Odin hangs himself for nine nights from the
branches of the World Tree and upon the same occasion also pierces his
own side with the sacred spear. As the result of this great sacrifice,
Odin, while suspended over the depths of Nifl-heim, discovered by
meditation the runes or alphabets by which later the records of his
people were preserved. Because of this remarkable experience, Odin is
sometimes shown seated on a gallows tree and he became the patron deity
of all who died by the noose. Esoterically, the Hanged Man is the human
spirit which is suspended from heaven by a single thread. Wisdom, not
death, is the reward for this voluntary sacrifice during which the human
soul, suspended above the world of illusion, and meditating upon its
unreality, is rewarded by the achievement of self-realization.

From a consideration of all these ancient and secret rituals it becomes
evident that the mystery of the *dying god* was universal among the
illumined and venerated colleges of the sacred teaching. This mystery
has been perpetuated in Christianity in the crucifixion and death of the
God-man-Jesus the Christ. The secret import of this world tragedy and
the Universal Martyr must be rediscovered if Christianity is to reach
the heights attained by the pagans in the days of their philosophic
supremacy. The myth of the dying god is the key to both universal and
individual redemption and regeneration, and those who do not comprehend
the true nature of this supreme allegory are not privileged to consider
themselves either wise or truly religious.
