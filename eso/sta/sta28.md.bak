# Fundamentals of Qabbalistic Cosmogony

THE Qabbalists conceive of the Supreme Deity as an Incomprehensible
Principle to be discovered only through the process of eliminating, in
order, all its cognizable attributes. That which remains--when every
knowable thing has been removed--is AIN SOPH, the eternal state of
*Being*. Although indefinable, the Absolute permeates all space.
Abstract to the degree of inconceivability, AIN SOPH is the
*unconditioned state of all things*. Substances, essences, and
intelligences are manifested out of the inscrutability of AIN SOPH, but
the Absolute itself is without substance, essence, or intelligence. AIN
SOPH may be likened to a great field of rich earth out of which rises a
myriad of plants, each different in color, formation, and fragrance, yet
each with its roots in the same dark loam--which, however, is unlike any
of the forms nurtured by it. The "plants" are universes, gods, and man,
all nourished by AIN SOPH and all with their source in one
definitionless essence; all with their spirits, souls, and bodies
fashioned from this essence, and doomed, like the plant, to return to
the black ground--AIN SOPH, the only Immortal--whence they came.

AIN SOPH was referred to by the Qabbalists as *The Most Ancient of all
the Ancients*. It was always considered as sexless. Its symbol was a
closed eye. While it may be truly said of AIN SOPH that to define It is
to defile It, the Rabbis postulated certain theories regarding the
manner in which AIN SOPH projected creations out of Itself, and they
also assigned to this Absolute Not-Being certain symbols as being
descriptive, in part at least, of Its powers. The nature of AIN SOPH
they symbolize by a circle, itself emblematic of eternity. This
hypothetical circle encloses a dimensionless area of incomprehensible
life, and the circular boundary of this life is abstract and measureless
infinity.

According to this concept, God is not only a Center but also Area.
Centralization is the first step towards limitation. Therefore, centers
which form in the substances of AIN SOPH are finite because they are
predestined to dissolution back into the Cause of themselves, while AIN
SOPH Itself is infinite because It is the ultimate condition of all
things. The circular shape given to AIN SOPH signifies that space is
hypothetically enclosed within a great crystal-like globe, outside of
which there is nothing, not even a vacuum. Within this globe--symbolic
of AIN SOPH--creation and dissolution take place. Every element and
principle that will ever be used in the eternities of Kosmic birth,
growth, and decay is within the transparent substances of this
intangible sphere. It is the Kosmic Egg which is not broken till the
great day "Be With Us," which is the end of the Cycle of Necessity, when
all things return to their ultimate cause.

In the process of creation the diffused life of AIN SOPH retires from
the circumference to the center of the circle and establishes a point,
which is the first manifesting One--the primitive limitation of the
all-pervading O. When the Divine Essence thus retires from the circular
boundary to the center, It leaves behind the Abyss, or, as the
Qabbalists term it, the Great Privation. Thus, in AIN SOPH is
established a twofold condition where previously had existed but one.
The first condition is the central point--the primitive objectified
radiance of the eternal, subjectified life. About this radiance is
darkness caused by the deprivation of the life which is drawn to the
center to create the first point, or universal germ. The universal AIN
SOPH, therefore, no longer shines through space, but rather upon space
from an established first point. Isaac Myer describes this process as
follows: "The Ain Soph at first was filling All and then made an
absolute concentration into Itself which produced the Abyss, Deep, or
Space, the Aveer Qadmon or Primitive Air, the Azoth; but this is not
considered in the Qabbalah as a perfect void or vacuum, a perfectly
empty Space, but is thought of as the Waters or Crystalline Chaotic Sea,
in which was a certain degree of Light inferior to that by which all the
created \[worlds and hierarchies\] were made." (See *The Qabbalah*.)

In the secret teachings of the Qabbalah it is taught that man's body is
enveloped in an ovoid of bubble-like iridescence, which is called the
Auric Egg. This is the causal sphere of man. It bears the same
relationship to man's physical body that the globe of AIN SOPH bears to
Its created universes. In fact, this Auric Egg is the AIN SOPH sphere of
the entity called man. In reality, therefore, the supreme consciousness
of man is in this aura, which extends in all directions and completely
encircles his lower bodies. As the consciousness in the Kosmic Egg is
withdrawn into a central point, which is then called God--the Supreme
One--so the consciousness in the Auric Egg of man is concentrated,
thereby causing the establishment of a point of consciousness called the
Ego. As the universes in Nature are formed from powers latent in the
Kosmic Egg, so everything used by man in all his incarnations throughout
the kingdoms of Nature is drawn from the latent powers within his Auric
Egg. Man never passes from this egg; it remains even after death. His
births, deaths, and rebirths all take place within it, and it cannot be
broken until the lesser day "Be With Us," when mankind--like the
universe--is liberated from the Wheel of Necessity.

### THE QABBALISTIC SYSTEM OF WORLDS

On the accompanying circular chart, the concentric rings represent
diagrammatically the forty rates of vibration (called by the Qabbalists
Spheres) which emanate from AIN SOPH. The circle X 1 is the outer
boundary of space. It circumscribes the area of AIN SOPH. The nature of
AIN SOPH Itself is divided into three parts, represented by the spaces
respectively between X 1 and X 2, X 2 and X 3, X 3 and A 1; thus:

|             |              |                                        |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| X 1 to X 2, | אין,         | AIN, the vacuum of pure spirit.        |
| X 2 to X 3, | אין סוף,     | AIN SOPH, the Limitless and Boundless. |
| X 3 to A 1, | אין סוף אור, | AIN SOPH AUR, the Limitless Light.     |

It should be borne in mind that in the beginning the Supreme Substance,
AIN, alone permeated the area of the circle; the inner rings had not yet
come into manifestation. As the Divine Essence concentrated Itself, the
rings X 2 and X 3 became apprehensible, for AIN SOPH is a limitation of
AIN, and AIN SOPH AUR, or Light, is a still greater limitation. Thus the
nature of the Supreme One is considered to be threefold, and from this
threefold nature the powers and elements of creation were reflected into
the Abyss left by the motion of AIN SOPH towards the center of Itself.
The continual motion of AIN SOPH towards the center of Itself resulted
in the establishment of the dot in the circle. The dot was called God,
as being the supreme individualization of the Universal Essence.
Concerning this the Zohar says:

"When the concealed of the Concealed wished to reveal Himself He first
made a single point: the Infinite was entirely unknown, and diffused no
light before this luminous point violently broke through into vision."

The name of this point is I AM, called by the Hebrews *Eheieh*. The
Qabbalists gave many names to this dot. On this subject Christian D.
Ginsberg writes, in substance: The dot is called the first crown,
because it occupies the highest position. It is called the aged, because
it is the first emanation. It is called the primordial or smooth point.
It is called the white head, the *Long Face*--Macroprosophus--and the
inscrutable height, because it controls and governs all the other
emanations.

When the white shining point had appeared, it was called *Kether*, which
means the *Crown*, and out of it radiated nine great globes, which
arranged themselves in the form of a tree. These nine together with the
first crown constituted the first system of *Sephiroth*. These ten were
the first limitation of ten abstract points within the nature of AIN
SOPH Itself. The power of AIN SOPH did not descend into these globes but
rather was reflected upon them as the light of the sun is reflected upon
the earth and planets. These ten globes were called the shining
*sapphires*, and it is believed by many Rabbins that the word *sapphire*
is the basis of the word *Sephira* (the singular of Sephiroth). The
great area which had been privated by the withdrawal of AIN SOPH into
the central point, *Kether*, was now filled by four concentric globes
called worlds, or spheres, and the light of the ten Sephiroth was
reflected down through each of these in turn. This resulted in the
establishment of four symbolical

[![THE HEBREW TRIAD.](tn/11700.jpg)

THE HEBREW TRIAD.  

The Qabbalists used the letter ש, Shin, to signify the trinity of the
first three Sephiroth. The central circle slightly above the other two
is the first Sephira--*Kether*, the White Head, the Crown. The other two
circles represent *Chochmah*, the Father, and *Binah*, the Mother. From
the union of the Divine Father and the Divine Mother are produced the
worlds and the generations of living things. The three flame-like points
of the letter ש have long been used to conceal this Creative Triad of
the Qabbalists.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

trees, each hearing the reflections of the ten Sephirothic globes. The
40 spheres of creation out of AIN SOPH are divided into four great world
chains, as follows:

A 1 to A 10, *Atziluth*, the Boundless World of Divine Names.

B 1 to B 10, *Briah*, the Archangelic World of Creations.

C 1 to C 10, *Yetzirah*, the Hierarchal World of Formations.

D 1 to D 10, *Assiah*, the Elemental World of Substances.

Each of these worlds has ten powers, or spheres--a parent globe and nine
others which conic out of it as emanations, each globe born out of the
one preceding. On the plane of *Atziluth* (A 1 to A 10), the highest and
most divine of all the created worlds, the unmanifested AIN SOPH
established His first point or dot in the Divine Sea--the three spheres
of X. This dot--A 1--contains all creation within it, but in this first
divine and uncontaminated state the dot, or first manifested. God, was
not considered as a personality by the Qabbalists but rather as a divine
establishment or foundation. It was called the *First Crown* and from it
issued the other circles of the *Atziluthic World*: A 2, A 3, A 4, A 5,
A 6, A 7, A 8, A 9, and A 10. In the three lower worlds these circles
are intelligences, planers, and elements, but in this first divine world
they are called the *Rings of the Sacred Names*.

The first ten great circles (or globes) of light which were manifested
out of AIN SOPH and the ten names of God assigned to them by the
Qabbalists are as follows:

From AIN SOPH came A 1, the First Crown, and the name of the first power
of God was *Eheieh*, which means *I Am* \[*That I Am*\].

From A 1 came A 2, the first Wisdom, and the name of the second power of
God was *Jehovah*, which means *Essence of Being*.

From A 2 came A 3, the first Understanding, and the name of the third
power of God was *Jehovah Elohim*, which means *God of Gods*.

From A 3 came A 4, the first Mercy, and the name of the fourth power of
God was *El*, which means *God the Creator*.

From A 4 came A 5, the first Severity, and the name of the fifth power
of God was *Elohim Gibor*, which means *God the Potent*.

From A 5 came A 6, the first Beauty, and the name of the sixth power of
God was *Eloah Vadaath*, which means *God the Strong*.

From A 6 came A 7, the first Victory, and the name of the seventh power
of God was *Jehovah Tzaboath*, which means *God of Hosts*.

From A 7 came A 8, the first Glory, and the name of the eighth power of
God was *Elohim Tzaboath*, which means *Lord God of Hosts*.

From A 8 came A 9, the first Foundation, and the name of the ninth power
of God was *Shaddai*, *El Chai*, which means *Omnipotent*.

From A 9 came A 10, the first Kingdom, and the name of the tenth power
of God was *Adonai Melekh*, which means *God*.

From A 10 came B 1, the Second Crown, and the World of *Briah* was
established.

The ten emanations from A 1 to A 10 inclusive are called the foundations
of all creations. The Qabbalists designate them the ten roots of the
Tree of Life. They are arranged in the form of a great human figure
called Adam Qadmon--the man made from the fire mist (red dirt), the
prototypic Universal Man. In the *Atziluthic* World, the powers of God
are most purely manifested. These ten pure and perfect radiations do not
descend into the lower worlds and take upon themselves forms, but are
reflected upon the substances of the inferior spheres. From the first,
or *Atziluthic*, World they are reflected into the second, or *Briatic*,
World. As the reflection always lacks some of the brilliancy of the
original image, so in the *Briatic* World the ten radiations lose part
of their infinite power. A reflection is always like the thing
reflected, but smaller and fainter.

In the second world, B 1 to B 10, the order of the spheres is the Name
as in the *Atziluthic* World, but the ten circles of light are less
brilliant and more tangible, and are here referred to as ten great
Spirits--divine creatures who assist in the establishment of order and
intelligence in the universe. As already noted, B 1 is born out of A 10
and is included within all the spheres superior to itself. Out of B 1
are taken nine globes--B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5, B 6, B 7, B 8, B 9, and B
10--which constitute the World of *Briah*. These ten subdivisions,
however, are really the ten Atziluthic powers reflected into the
substance of the *Briatic* World. B 1 is the ruler of this world, for it
contains all the other rings of its own world and also the rings of the
third and fourth worlds, C and D. In the World of *Briah* the ten
spheres of light are called the *Archangels of Briah*. Their order and
powers are as follows:

From A 10 came B 1, the Second Crown; it is called *Metatron*, the Angel
of the Presence.

From B 1 came B 2, the second Wisdom; it is called *Raziel*, the Herald
of Deity who revealed the mysteries of Qabbalah to Adam.

From B 2 carne B 3, the second Understanding; it is called *Tsaphkiel*,
the Contemplation of God.

From B 3 came B 4 ' the second Mercy; it is called *Tsadkiel*, the
justice of God.

From B 4 came B 5, the second Severity; it is called *Samael*, the
Severity of God.

From B 5 came B 6, the second Beauty; it is called *Michael*, Like Unto
God.

From B 6 came B 7, the second Victory; it is called *Haniel*, the Grace
of God.

From B 7 came B 8, the second Glory; it is called *Raphael*, the Divine
Physician.

From B 8 came B 9, the second Foundation; it is called *Gabriel*, the
Man-God.

From B 9 came B 10, the second Kingdom; it is called *Sandalphon*, the
Messias.

From B 10 came C 1, the Third Crown, and the World of *Yetzirah* was
established.

The ten Archangels of *Briah* are conceived to be ten great spiritual
beings, whose duty is to manifest the ten powers of the Great Name of
God existent in the *Atziluthic* World, which surrounds and
interpenetrates the entire world of creation. All things manifesting in
the lower worlds exist first in the intangible rings of the upper
spheres, so that creation is, in truth, the process of making tangible
the intangible by extending the intangible into various vibratory rates.
The ten globes of *Briatic* power, while themselves reflections, are
mirrored downward into the third or *Yetziratic* World, where still more
limited in their expression they become the spiritual and invisible
zodiac which is behind the visible band of constellations. In this third
world the ten globes of the original Atziluthic World are greatly
limited and dimmed, but they are still infinitely powerful in comparison
with the state of substance in which man dwells. In the third world, C 1
to C 10, the globes become hierarchies of celestial creatures, called
the *Choirs of Yetzirah*. Here again, all are included within the ring C
1, the power which controls the Yetziratic World and which includes
within itself and controls the entire world D. The order of the globes
and the names of the hierarchies composing them are as follows:

From B 10 came C 1, the Third Crown; the Hierarchy is the Cherubim,
*Chaioth Ha Kadosh*, the Holy Animals.

From C 1 came C 2, the third Wisdom; the Hierarchy is the Cherubim,
*Orphanim*, the Wheels.

From C 2 came C 3, the third Understanding; the Hierarchy is the
Thrones, *Aralim*, the Mighty Ones.

From C 3 came C 4, the third Mercy; the Hierarchy is the Dominations,
*Chashmalim*, the Brilliant Ones.

From C 4 came C 5, the third Severity; the Hierarchy is the Powers,
*Seraphim*, the Flaming Serpents.

From C 5 came C 6, the third Beauty; the Hierarchy is the Virtues,
*Melachim*, the Kings.

From C 6 came C 7, the third Victory; the Hierarchy is the
Principalities, *Elohim*, the Gods.

From C 7 came C 8, the third Glory; the Hierarchy is the Archangels,
*Ben Elohim*, the Sons of God.

From C 8 came C 9, the third Foundation; the Hierarchy is the Angels,
*Cherubim*, the Scat of the Sons.

From C 9 came C 10, the third Kingdom; the Hierarchy is Humanity, the
*Ishim*, the Souls of Just Men.

From C 10 came D 1, the Fourth Crown, and the World of *Assiah* was
established.

From the *Yetziratic* World the light of the ten spheres is reflected
into the World of *Assiah*, the lowest of the four. The ten globes of
the original *Atziluthic* World here take upon themselves forms of
physical matter and the sidereal system is the result. The World of
*Assiah*, or the elemental world of substance, is the one into which
humanity descended at the time of Adam's fall. The Garden of Eden is the
three upper worlds, and for his sins man was forced into the sphere of
substance and assumed coats of skin (bodies). All of the spiritual
forces of the upper worlds, A, B, C, when they strike against the
elements of the lower world, D, are distorted and perverted, resulting
in the creation of hierarchies of demons to correspond with the good
spirits in each of the higher worlds. In all the ancient Mysteries,
matter was regarded as the source of all evil and spirit the source of
all good, for matter inhibits and limits, often so clogging the inner
perceptions that man is unable to recognize his own divine
potentialities. Since matter thus prevents humanity from claiming its
birthright, it is called the Adversary, the power of evil. The fourth
world, D, is the world of solar systems,

THE PLAN OF DIVINE ACTIVITY.  

According to the Qabbalists, the life of the Supreme Creator permeates
all substance, all space, and all time, but for diagrammatic purposes
the Supreme, All-Inclusive Life is limited by Circle 3, which may be
called "the boundary line of Divine existence." The Divine Life
permeating the area bounded by Circle 3 is focused at Point 1, which
thus becomes the personification of the impersonal life and is termed
"the First Crown." The creative forces pouring through Point 1 come into
manifestation as the objective universe in the intermediate space,
Circle 2.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

comprising not only the one of which the earth is a part but all the
solar systems in the universe.

Opinions differ as to the arrangement of the globes of this last world,
D 1 to D 10 inclusive. The ruler of the fourth world is D 1, called by
some the *Fiery Heaven*; by others the *Primum Mobile*, or the *First
Motion*. From this whirling fire emanates the material starry zodiac, D
2, in contradistinction to the invisible spiritual zodiac of the
*Yetziratic* World. From the zodiac, D 2, are differentiated the spheres
of the planets in concatenate order. The ten spheres of the World of
*Assiah* are as follows:

From C 10 came D 1, the Fourth Crown; *Rashith Ha-Galagalum*, the
*Primum Mobile*, the fiery mist which is the beginning of the material
universe.

From D 1 came D 2, the fourth Wisdom; *Masloth*, the Zodiac, the
Firmament of the Fixed Stars.

From D 2 came D 3, the fourth Understanding; *Shabbathai*, the sphere of
Saturn.

From D 3 came D 4, the fourth Mercy; *Tzedeg*, the sphere of Jupiter.

From D 4 came D 5, the fourth Severity; *Madim*, the sphere of Mars.

From D 5 came D 6, the fourth Beauty; *Shemesh*, the sphere of the Sun.

From D 6 came D 7, the fourth Victory; *Nogah*, the sphere of Venus.

From D 7 came D 8, the fourth Glory; *Kokab*, the sphere of Mercury.

From D 8 came D 9, the fourth Foundation; *Levanah*, the sphere of the
Moon.

From D 9 came D 10, the Fourth Kingdom; *Cholom Yosodoth*, the sphere of
the Four Elements.

By inserting a sphere (which he calls the Empyrean) before the Primum
Mobile, Kircher moves each of the other spheres down one, resulting in
the elimination of the sphere of the elements and making D 10 the sphere
of the Moon.

In the World of *Assiah* are to be found the demons and tempters. These
are likewise reflections of the ten great globes of *Atziluth*, but
because of the distortion of the images resulting from the base
substances of the World of *Assiah* upon which they are reflected, they
become evil creatures, called *shells* by the Qabbalists. There are ten
hierarchies of these demons to correlate with the ten hierarchies of
good spirits composing the *Yetziratic* World. There are

[![THE QABBALISTIC SCHEME OF THE FOUR WORLDS.](tn/11900.jpg)

THE QABBALISTIC SCHEME OF THE FOUR WORLDS.  

In the above chart the dark line between X 3 and A 1 constitutes the
boundary of the original dot, while the concentric circles within this
heavier line symbolize the emanations and the worlds which came forth
from the dot. As this dot is contained within the outer rings X 1, X 2,
and X 3, and represents the first establishment of an individualized
existence, so the lower universe symbolized by the forty concentric
circles within the dot represents the lower creation evolved out of and
yet contained within the nature of the first Crown, which may be called
God, within whom the divine powers, the celestial beings the sidereal
worlds, and man, live and move and have their being. It is highly
important that all the rings within A 1 be considered as being enclosed
by the primitive dot, which is itself encircled by the great ring X 1,
or the Auric Egg of AIN SOPH.

Each ring includes with in its own nature all the rings within itself
and is included within the natures of all the rings outside of itself.
Thus, A 1--the primitive dot--controls and contains the thirty-nine
rings which it encloses, all of these partaking of its nature in varying
degrees according to their respective dignities. Consequently, the
entire area from A 1 to D 10 inclusive is the original dot, and the
rings symbolize the divisions which took place with in it and the
emanations which poured out from it after its establishment in the midst
of the abstract nature of AIN SOPH. The powers of the rings decrease
towards the center of the diagram, for Power is measured by the number
of things controlled, and each ring controls the rings within it and is
controlled by the rings outside of it. Thus, while A 1 controls
thirty-nine rings besides itself, B 1 controls only twenty-nine rings
besides its own. Therefore, A 1 is more powerful than B 1. As the
greatest spiritual solidity, or permanence, is at the circumference and
the greatest material density, or impermanence, is at the center of the
diagram, the rings as they decrease in Power become more material and
substantial until the center sphere, D 10, symbolizes the actual
chemical elements of the earth. The rates of vibration are also lower as
the rings approach the center. Thus, the vibration of A 2 is lower than
A 1 but higher than A 3, and so on in decreasing scale towards the
center, A 1 being the highest and D 10 the lowest sphere of creation.
While A 1, the ruler of creation, controls the circles marked A, B, C,
and D, it is less than the three rings of AIN SOPH--X 1, X2, and X3--and
therefore bows before the throne of the ineffable Creator from whose
substances it was individualized.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

also ten Archdemons, corresponding to the ten Archangels of *Briah*. The
black magicians use these inverted spirits in their efforts to attain
their nefarious ends, but in time the demon destroys those who bind
themselves to it. The ten orders of demons and the ten Archdemons of the
World of *Assiah* are as follows:

D 1, the evil Crown; the hierarchy is called *Thaumiel*, the doubles of
God, the Two-headed; the Archdemons are *Satan* and *Moloch*.

From D 1 came D 2, the evil Wisdom; the hierarchy is called
*Chaigidiel*, those who obstruct; the Archdemon is *Adam Belial*.

From D 2 came D 3, the evil Understanding; the hierarchy is called
*Satharial*, the concealment of God, the Archdemon is *Lucifuge*.

From D 3 came D 4, the evil Mercy; the hierarchy is called *Gamchicoth*,
the disturber of things; the Archdemon is *Astaroth*.

From D 4 came D 5, the evil Severity; the hierarchy is called *Golab*,
incendiarism and burning; the Archdemon is *Asmodeus*.

From D 5 came D 6, the evil Beauty; the hierarchy is called *Togarini*,
the wranglers; the Archdemon is *Belphegor*.

From D 6 came D 7, the evil Victory; the hierarchy is called *Harab
Serap*, the dispensing Raven; the Archdemon is *Baal Chanan*.

From D 7 came D 8, the evil Glory; the hierarchy is called *Samael*, the
embroiler; the Archdemon is *Adramelek*.

From D 8 came D 9, the evil Foundation; the hierarchy is called
*Gamaliel*, the obscene; the Archdemon is *Lilith*.

From D 9 came D 10, the evil Kingdom; the hierarchy is called
*Nahemoth*, the impure; the Archdemon is *Nahema*.

The Qabbalists declare that the worlds, intelligences, and hierarchies
were established according to the vision of Ezekiel. By the man of
Ezekiel's vision is symbolized the World of *Atziluth*; by the throne,
the World of *Briah*; by the firmament, the World of *Yetzirah*; and by
the living creatures the World of *Assiah*. These spheres are the wheels
within wheels of the prophet. The Qabbalists next established a human
figure in each of the four worlds: A 1 was the head and A 10 the feet of
the man of *Atziluth*; B 1 was the head and B 10 the feet of the man of
*Briah*; C 1 was the head and C 10 the feet of the man of *Yetzirah*; D
1 was the head and D 10 the feet of the man of *Assiah*. These four are
called the *World Men*. They are considered androgynous and are the
prototypes of humanity.

The human body, like that of the universe, is considered to be a
material expression of ten globes or spheres of light. Therefore man is
called the Microcosm--the little world, built in the image of the great
world of which he is a part. The Qabbalists also established a
mysterious universal man with his head at A 1 and his feet at D 10. This
is probably the secret significance of the great figure of
Nebuchadnezzar's dream, with its head in the World of *Atziluth*, its
arms and hands in the World of *Briah*, its generative system in the
World of *Yetzirah*, and its legs and feet in the World of *Assiah*.
This is the *Grand Man of the Zohar*, of whom Eliphas Levi writes:

"It is not less astonishing to observe at the beginning of the Zohar the
profundity of its notions and the sublime simplicity of its images. It
is said as follows: 'The science of equilibrium is the key of occult
science. Unbalanced forces perish in the void. So passed the kings of
the elder world, the princes of the giants. They have fallen like trees
without roots, and their place is found no more. Through the conflict of
unbalanced forces, the devastated earth was void and formless, until the
Spirit of God made for itself a place in heaven and reduced the mass of
waters. All the aspirations of Nature were directed then towards unity
of form, towards the living synthesis (if equilibrated forces; the face
of God, crowned with light, rose over the vast sea and was reflected in
the waters thereof. His two eyes were manifested, radiating with
splendour, darting two beams of light which crossed with those of the
reflection. The brow of God and His eyes formed a triangle in heaven,
and its reflection formed a second triangle in the waters. So was
revealed the number six, being that of universal creation.' The text,
which would be unintelligible in a literal version, is translated here
by way of interpretation. The author makes it plain that the human form
which he ascribes to Deity is only an image of his meaning and that God
is beyond expression by human thought or representation by any figure.
Pascal said that God is a circle, of which the center is everywhere and
the circumference nowhere. But how is one to imagine a circle apart from
its circumference? The Zohar adopts the antithesis of this paradoxical
image and in respect of the circle of Pascal would say rather that the
circumference is everywhere, while that which is nowhere is the center.
It is however to a balance and not to a circle that it compares the
universal equilibrium of things. It affirms that equilibrium is
everywhere and so also is the central point where the balance hangs in
suspension. We find that the Zohar is thus more forcible and more
profound than Pascal. \* \* \* The Zohar is a genesis of light; the
Sepher Yetzirah is a ladder of truth. Therein are expounded the
two-and-thirty absolute symbols of speech--being numbers and letters.
Each letter produces a number, an idea and a form, so that mathematics
are applicable to forms and ideas, even as to numbers, in virtue of an
exact proportion, and a perfect correspondence. By the science of the
Sepher Yetzirah, the human mind is rooted in truth and in reason; it
accounts for all progress possible to intelligence by means of the
evolution of numbers. Thus does the Zohar represent absolute truth,
while the Sepher Yetzirah furnishes the method of its acquisition, its
discernment and application." (*History of Magic*.)

By placing man himself at the point D 10, his true constitution is
revealed. He exists upon four worlds, only one of which is visible. It
is then made evident that his parts and members upon the material plane
are, by analogy, hierarchies and intelligences in the higher worlds.
Here, again, the law of interpenetration is evidenced. Although within
man is the entire universe (the 43 spheres interpenetrating D 10), he is
ignorant of its existence because he cannot exercise control over that
which is superior to or greater than himself. Nevertheless, all these
higher spheres exercise control over him, as his functions and
activities demonstrate. If they did not, he would be an inert mass of
substance. Death is merely the result of deflecting the life impulses of
the higher rings away from the lower body.

The control of the transubstantial rings over their own material
reflection is called *life*, and the spirit of man is, in reality, a
name given to this great host of intelligences, which are focused upon
substance through a point called the *ego*, established in the midst of
themselves. X 1 is the outside boundary of the human Auric Egg, and the
entire diagram becomes a cross section of the constitution of man, or a
cross section of the Kosmic constitution, if correlated with the
universe. By the secret culture of the Qabbalistic School, man is taught
how to climb the rings (unfold his consciousness) until at last he
returns to AIN SOPH. The process by which this is accomplished is called
the *Fifty Gates of Light*. Kircher, the Jesuit Qabbalist, declares that
Moses passed through forty-nine of the gates, but that Christ alone
passed the fiftieth gate.

To the third edition of the *Sepher Yetzirah* translated from the Hebrew
by Wm. Wynn Westcott are appended the Fifty Gates of Intelligence
emanating from *Binah*, the second Sephira. The source of this
information is Kircher's *Œdipus Ægyptiacus*. The gates are divided into
six orders, of which the first four have each ten subdivisions, the
fifth nine, and the sixth only one.

The first order of gates is termed *Elementary* and its divisions areas
follows: (1) Chaos, Hyle, the First Matter; (2) Formless, void,
lifeless; (3) The Abyss; (4) Origin of the Elements; (5) Earth (no seed
germs); (6) Water;(7) Air;(8) Fire;(9) Differentiation of qualities;
(10) Mixture and combination.

The second order of gates is termed *Decad of Evolution* and its
divisions areas follows: (11) Minerals differentiate; (12) Vegetable
principles appear; (13) Seeds germinate in moisture; (14) Herbs and
Trees; (15) Fructification in vegetable life; (16) Origin of low forms
of animal life; (17) Insects and Reptiles appear; (18) Fishes,
vertebrate life in the waters; (19) Birds, vertebrate life in the air;
(20) Quadrupeds, vertebrate earth animals.

The third order of gates is termed *Decad of Humanity* and its divisions
are as follows: (21) Appearance of Man; (22) Material human body; (23)
Human Soul conferred; (24) Mystery of Adam and Eve; (25) Complete Man as
the Microcosm; (26) Gift of five human faces acting exteriorly; (27)
Gift of five powers to the soul; (28) Adam Kadmon, the Heavenly Man;
(29) Angelic beings, (30) Man in the image of God.

The fourth order of gates is termed *World of Spheres* and its divisions
are as follows: (31) The Heaven of the Moon; (32) The Heaven of Mercury,
(33) The Heaven of Venus; (34) The Heaven of the Sun; (35) The Heaven of
Mars; (36) The Heaven of Jupiter; (37) The Heaven of Saturn; (38) The
Firmament; (39) The Primum Mobile; (40) The Empyrean Heaven.

The fifth order of gates is termed *The Angelic World* and its divisions
are as follows: (41) Ishim--Sons of Fire; (42) Orphanim--Cherubim; (43)
Aralim--Thrones; (44) Chashmalim--Dominions; (45) Seraphim--Virtues;
(46) Melachim--Powers; (47) Elohim--Principalities; (48) Ben
Elohim--Angels; (49) Cherubim--Archangels. \[The order of the Angels is
a matter of controversy, the arrangement above differing from that
accepted in other sections of this volume. The Rabbins disagree
fundamentally as to the proper sequence of the Angelic names.\]

The sixth order is termed *The Archetype* and consists of but one gate:
(50) God, AIN SOPH, He whom no mortal eye hath seen. The fiftieth gate
leads from creation into the Creative Principle and he who passes
through it returns into the unlimited and undifferentiated condition of
ALL. The fifty gates reveal a certain evolutionary process and it was
declared by the Rabbins that he who would attain to the highest degree
of understanding must pass sequentially through all of these orders of
life, each of which constituted a gate in that the spirit, passing from
the lower to the higher, found in each more responsive organism new
avenues of self-expression.
