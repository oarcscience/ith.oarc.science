# The Pythagorean Theory of Music and Color

HARMONY is a state recognized by great philosophers as the immediate
prerequisite of beauty. A compound is termed *beautiful* only when its
parts are in *harmonious* combination. The world is called beautiful and
its Creator is designated the *Good* because good perforce must act in
conformity with its own nature; and good acting according to its own
nature is harmony, because the good which it accomplishes is harmonious
with the good which it is. Beauty, therefore, is harmony manifesting its
own intrinsic nature in the world of form.

The universe is made up of successive gradations of good, these
gradations ascending from matter (which is the least degree of good) to
spirit (which is the greatest degree of good). In man, his superior
nature is the *summum bonum*. It therefore follows that his highest
nature most readily cognizes good because the good external to him in
the world is in harmonic ratio with the good present in his soul. What
man terms *evil* is therefore, in common with matter, merely the least
degree of its own opposite. The least degree of good presupposes
likewise the least degree of harmony and beauty. Thus deformity (evil)
is really the least harmonious combination of elements naturally
harmonic as individual units. Deformity is unnatural, for, the sum of
all things being the *Good*, it is natural that all things should
partake of the *Good* and be arranged in combinations that are
harmonious. Harmony is the manifesting expression of the *Will* of the
eternal *Good*.

### THE PHILOSOPHY OF MUSIC

It is highly probable that the Greek initiates gained their knowledge of
the philosophic and therapeutic aspects of music from the Egyptians,
who, in turn, considered Hermes the founder of the art. According to one
legend, this god constructed the first lyre by stretching strings across
the concavity of a turtle shell. Both Isis and Osiris were patrons of
music and poetry. Plato, in describing the antiquity of these arts among
the Egyptians, declared that songs and poetry had existed in Egypt for
at least ten thousand years, and that these were of such an exalted and
inspiring nature that only gods or godlike men could have composed them.
In the Mysteries the lyre was regarded as the secret symbol of the human
constitution, the body of the instrument representing the physical form,
the strings the nerves, and the musician the spirit. Playing upon the
nerves, the spirit thus created the harmonies of normal functioning,
which, however, became discords if the nature of man were defiled.

While the early Chinese, Hindus, Persians, Egyptians, Israelites, and
Greeks employed both vocal and instrumental music in their religious
ceremonials, also to complement their poetry and drama, it remained for
Pythagoras to raise the art to its true dignity by demonstrating its
mathematical foundation. Although it is said that he himself was not a
musician, Pythagoras is now generally credited with the discovery of the
diatonic scale. Having first learned the divine theory of music from the
priests of the various Mysteries into which he had been accepted,
Pythagoras pondered for several years upon the laws governing consonance
and dissonance. How he actually solved the problem is unknown, but the
following explanation has been invented.

One day while meditating upon the problem of harmony, Pythagoras chanced
to pass a brazier's shop where workmen were pounding out a piece of
metal upon an anvil. By noting the variances in pitch between the sounds
made by large hammers and those made by smaller implements, and
carefully estimating the harmonies and discords resulting from
combinations of these sounds, he gained his first clue to the musical
intervals of the diatonic scale. He entered the shop, and after
carefully examining the tools and making mental note of their weights,
returned to his own house and constructed an arm of wood so that it:
extended out from the wall of his room. At regular intervals along this
arm he attached four cords, all of like composition, size, and weight.
To the first of these he attached a twelve-pound weight, to the second a
nine-pound weight, to the third an eight-pound weight, and to the fourth
a six-pound weight. These different weights corresponded to the sizes of
the braziers' hammers.

Pythagoras thereupon discovered that the first and fourth strings when
sounded together produced the harmonic interval of the octave, for
doubling the weight had the same effect as halving the string. The
tension of the first string being twice that of the fourth string, their
ratio was said to be 2:1, or duple. By similar experimentation he
ascertained that the first and third string produced the harmony of the
diapente, or the interval of the fifth. The tension of the first string
being half again as much as that of the third string, their ratio was
said to be 3:2, or sesquialter. Likewise the second and fourth strings,
having the same ratio as the first and third strings, yielded a diapente
harmony. Continuing his investigation, Pythagoras discovered that the
first and second strings produced the harmony of the diatessaron, or the
interval of the third; and the tension of the first string being a third
greater than that of the second string, their ratio was said to be 4:3,
or sesquitercian. The third and fourth strings, having the same ratio as
the first and second strings, produced another harmony of the
diatessaron. According to Iamblichus, the second and third strings had
the ratio of 8:9, or epogdoan.

The key to harmonic ratios is hidden in the famous Pythagorean
tetractys, or pyramid of dots. The *tetractys* is made up of the first
four numbers--1, 2, 3, and 4--which in their proportions reveal the
intervals of the octave, the diapente, and the diatessaron. While the
law of harmonic intervals as set forth above is true, it has been
subsequently proved that hammers striking metal in the manner

THE INTERVALS AND HARMONIES OF THE SPHERES.  

From Stanley's *The History of Philosophy*.

In the Pythagorean concept of the music of the spheres, the interval
between the earth and the sphere of the fixed stars was considered to be
a diapason--the most perfect harmonic interval. The allowing arrangement
is most generally accepted for the musical intervals of the planets
between the earth and the sphere of the fixed stars: From the sphere of
the earth to the sphere of the moon; one tone; from the sphere of the
moon to that of Mercury, one half-tone; from Mercury to Venus, one-half;
from Venus to the sun, one and one-half tones; from the sun to Mars, one
tone; from Mars to Jupiter, one-half tone; from Jupiter to Saturn,
one-half tone; from Saturn to the fixed stars, one-half tone. The sum of
these intervals equals the six whole tones of the octave.

THE CONSONANCES OF THE MUNDANE MONOCHORD.  

From Fludd's *De Musica Mundana*.

This diagrammatic sector represents the major gradations of energy and
substance between elemental earth and absolute unconditioned force.
Beginning with the superior, the fifteen graduated spheres descend in
the following order: Limitless and Eternal Life; the superior, the
middle, and the inferior Empyrean; the seven planets; and the four
elements. Energy is symbolized by Fludd as a pyramid with its base upon
the concave surface of the superior Empyrean, and substance as another
Pyramid with its base upon the convex surface of the sphere (not planet)
of earth. These pyramids demonstrate the relative proportions of energy
and substance entering into the composition of the fifteen planes of
being. It will be noted that the ascending pyramid of substance touches
but does not pierce the fifteenth sphere--that of Limitless and Eternal
Life. Likewise, the descending pyramid of energy touches but does not
pierce the first sphere--the grossest condition of substance. The plane
of the sun is denominated the *sphere of equality*, for here neither
energy nor substance predominate. The mundane monochord consists of a
hypothetical string stretched from the base of the pyramid of energy to
the base of the pyramid of substance.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

described will not produce the various tones ascribed to them. In all
probability, therefore, Pythagoras actually worked out his theory of
harmony from the monochord--a contrivance consisting of a single string
stretched between two pegs and supplied with movable frets.

To Pythagoras music was one of the dependencies of the divine science of
mathematics, and its harmonies were inflexibly controlled by
mathematical proportions. The Pythagoreans averred that mathematics
demonstrated the exact method by which the good established and
maintained its universe. Number therefore preceded harmony, since it was
the immutable law that governs all harmonic proportions. After
discovering these harmonic ratios, Pythagoras gradually initiated his
disciples into this, the supreme arcanum of his Mysteries. He divided
the multitudinous parts of creation into a vast number of planes or
spheres, to each of which he assigned a tone, a harmonic interval, a
number, a name, a color, and a form. He then proceeded to prove the
accuracy of his deductions by demonstrating them upon the different
planes of intelligence and substance ranging from the most abstract
logical premise to the most concrete geometrical solid. From the common
agreement of these diversified methods of proof he established the
indisputable existence of certain natural laws.

Having once established music as an exact science, Pythagoras applied
his newly found law of harmonic intervals to all the phenomena of
Nature, even going so far as to demonstrate the harmonic relationship of
the planets, constellations, and elements to each other. A notable
example of modern corroboration of ancient philosophical reaching is
that of the progression of the elements according to harmonic ratios.
While making a list of the elements in the ascending order of their
atomic weights, John A. Newlands discovered at every eighth element a
distinct repetition of properties. This discovery is known as the *law
of octaves* in modern chemistry.

Since they held that harmony must be determined not by the sense
perceptions but by reason and mathematics, the Pythagoreans called
themselves *Canonics*, as distinguished from musicians of the *Harmonic
School*, who asserted taste and instinct to be the true normative
principles of harmony. Recognizing, however, the profound effect: of
music upon the senses and emotions, Pythagoras did not hesitate to
influence the mind and body with what he termed "musical medicine."

Pythagoras evinced such a marked preference for stringed instruments
that he even went so far as to warn his disciples against allowing their
ears to be defiled by the sounds of flutes or cymbals. He further
declared that the soul could be purified from its irrational influences
by solemn songs sung to the accompaniment of the lyre. In his
investigation of the therapeutic value of harmonics, Pythagoras
discovered that the seven modes--or keys--of the Greek system of music
had the power to incite or allay the various emotions. It is related
that while observing the stars one night he encountered a young man
befuddled with strong drink and mad with jealousy who was piling faggots
about his mistress' door with the intention of burning the house. The
frenzy of the youth was accentuated by a flutist a short distance away
who was playing a tune in the stirring Phrygian mode. Pythagoras induced
the musician to change his air to the slow, and rhythmic Spondaic mode,
whereupon the intoxicated youth immediately became composed and,
gathering up his bundles of wood, returned quietly to his own home.

There is also an account of how Empedocles, a disciple of Pythagoras, by
quickly changing the mode of a musical composition he was playing, saved
the life of his host, Anchitus, when the latter was threatened with
death by the sword of one whose father he had condemned to public
execution. It is also known that Esculapius, the Greek physician, cured
sciatica and other diseases of the nerves by blowing a loud trumpet in
the presence of the patient.

Pythagoras cured many ailments of the spirit, soul, and body by having
certain specially prepared musical compositions played in the presence
of the sufferer or by personally reciting short selections from such
early poets as Hesiod and Homer. In his university at Crotona it was
customary for the Pythagoreans to open and to close each day with
songs--those in the morning calculated to clear the mind from sleep and
inspire it to the activities of the coming day; those in the evening of
a mode soothing, relaxing, and conducive to rest. At the vernal equinox,
Pythagoras caused his disciples to gather in a circle around one of
their number who led them in song and played their accompaniment upon a
lyre.

The therapeutic music of Pythagoras is described by Iamblichus thus:
"And there are certain melodies devised as remedies against the passions
of the soul, and also against despondency and lamentation, which
Pythagoras invented as things that afford the greatest assistance in
these maladies. And again, he employed other melodies against rage and
anger, and against every aberration of the soul. There is also another
kind of modulation invented as a remedy against desires." (See *The Life
of Pythagoras*.)

It is probable that the Pythagoreans recognized a connection between the
seven Greek modes and the planets. As an example, Pliny declares that
Saturn moves in the Dorian mode and Jupiter in the Phrygian mode. It is
also apparent that the temperaments are keyed to the various modes, and
the passions likewise. Thus, anger--which is a fiery passion--may be
accentuated by a fiery mode or its power neutralized by a watery mode.

The far-reaching effect exercised by music upon the culture of the
Greeks is thus summed up by Emil Nauman: "Plato depreciated the notion
that music was intended solely to create cheerful and agreeable
emotions, maintaining rather that it should inculcate a love of all that
is noble, and hatred of all that is mean, and that nothing could more
strongly influence man's innermost feelings than melody and rhythm.
Firmly convinced of this, he agreed with Damon of Athens, the musical
instructor of Socrates, that the introduction of a new and presumably
enervating scale would endanger the future of a whole nation, and that
it was not possible to alter a key without shaking the very foundations
of the State. Plato affirmed that music which ennobled the mind was of a
far higher kind than that which merely appealed to the senses, and he
strongly insisted that it was the paramount duty of the Legislature to
suppress all music of an effeminate and lascivious character, and to
encourage only s that which was pure and dignified; that bold and
stirring melodies were for men, gentle and soothing ones for women. From
this it is evident that music played a considerable part in the
education of the Greek youth. The greatest care was also to be taken in
the selection of instrumental music, because the absence of words
rendered its signification doubtful, and it was difficult to foresee
whether it would exercise upon the people a benign or baneful influence.
Popular taste, being always tickled by sensuous and meretricious
effects, was to be treated with deserved contempt. (See *The History of
Music*.)

Even today martial music is used with telling effect in times of war,
and religious music, while no longer developed in accordance with the
ancient theory, still profoundly influences the emotions of the laity.

### THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES

The most sublime but least known of all the Pythagorean speculations was
that of sidereal harmonics. It was said that of all men only Pythagoras
heard *the music of the spheres*. Apparently the Chaldeans were the
first people to conceive of the heavenly bodies joining in a cosmic
chant as they moved in stately manner across the sky. Job describes a
time "when the stars of the morning sang together," and in *The Merchant
of Venice* the author of the Shakesperian plays

INTERVALS.](tn/08200.jpg)

THE MUNDANE MONOCHORD WITH ITS PROPORTIONS AND INTERVALS.  

From Fludd's *De Musica Mundana*.

In this chart is set forth a summary of Fludd's theory of universal
music. The interval between the element of earth and the highest heaven
is considered as a double octave, thus showing the two extremes of
existence to be in disdiapason harmony. It is signifies that the highest
heaven, the sun, and the earth have the same time, the difference being
in pitch. The sun is the lower octave of the highest heaven and the
earth the lower octave of the sun. The lower octave (Γ to G) comprises
that part of the universe in which substance predominate over energy.
Its harmonies, therefore, are more gross than those of the higher octave
(G to g) wherein energy predominates over substance. "If struck in the
more spiritual part," writes Fludd, "the monochord will give eternal
life; if in the more material part, transitory life." It will be noted
that certain elements, planets, and celestial spheres sustain a harmonic
ratio to each other, Fludd advanced this as a key to the sympathies and
antipathies existing between the various departments of Nature.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

writes: "There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st but in his
motion like an angel sings." So little remains, however, of the
Pythagorean system of celestial music that it is only possible to
approximate his actual theory.

Pythagoras conceived the universe to be an immense monochord, with its
single string connected at its upper end to absolute spirit and at its
lower end to absolute matter--in other words, a cord stretched between
heaven and earth. Counting inward from the circumference of the heavens,
Pythagoras, according to some authorities, divided the universe into
nine parts; according to others, into twelve parts. The twelvefold
system was as follows: The first division was called the *empyrean*, or
the sphere of the fixed stars, and was the dwelling place of the
immortals. The second to twelfth divisions were (in order) the spheres
of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the sun, Venus, Mercury, and the moon, and
fire, air, water, and earth. This arrangement of the seven planets (the
sun and moon being regarded as planets in the old astronomy) is
identical with the candlestick symbolism of the Jews--the sun in the
center as the main stem with three planets on either side of it.

The names given by the Pythagoreans to the various notes of the diatonic
scale were, according to Macrobius, derived from an estimation of the
velocity and magnitude of the planetary bodies. Each of these gigantic
spheres as it rushed endlessly through space was believed to sound a
certain tone caused by its continuous displacement of the *æthereal
diffusion*. As these tones were a manifestation of divine order and
motion, it must necessarily follow that they partook of the harmony of
their own source. "The assertion that the planets in their revolutions
round the earth uttered certain sounds differing according to their
respective 'magnitude, celerity and local distance,' was commonly made
by the Greeks. Thus Saturn, the farthest planet, was said to give the
gravest note, while the Moon, which is the nearest, gave the sharpest.
'These sounds of the seven planets, and the sphere of the fixed stars,
together with that above us \[Antichthon\], are the nine Muses, and
their joint symphony is called Mnemosyne.'" (See *The Canon*.)This
quotation contains an obscure reference to the ninefold division of the
universe previously mentioned.

The Greek initiates also recognized a fundamental relationship between
the individual heavens or spheres of the seven planets, and the seven
sacred vowels. The first heaven uttered the sound of the sacred vowel Α
(Alpha); the second heaven, the sacred vowel Ε (Epsilon); the third, Η
(Eta); the fourth, Ι (Iota); the fifth, Ο (Omicron); the sixth, Υ
(Upsilon); and the seventh heaven, the sacred vowel Ω (Omega). When
these seven heavens sing together they produce a perfect harmony which
ascends as an everlasting praise to the throne of the Creator. (See
Irenæus' *Against Heresies*.) Although not so stated, it is probable
that the planetary heavens are to be considered as ascending in the
Pythagorean order, beginning with the sphere of the moon, which would be
the first heaven.

Many early instruments had seven Strings, and it is generally conceded
that Pythagoras was the one who added the eighth string to the lyre of
Terpander. The seven strings were always related both to their
correspondences in the human body and to the planets. The names of God
were also conceived to be formed from combinations of the seven
planetary harmonies. The Egyptians confined their sacred songs to the
seven primary sounds, forbidding any others to be uttered in their
temples. One of their hymns contained the following invocation: "The
seven sounding tones praise Thee, the Great God, the ceaseless working
Father of the whole universe." In another the Deity describes Himself
thus: "I am the great indestructible lyre of the whole world, attuning
the songs of the heavens. (See Nauman's *History of Music*.)

The Pythagoreans believed that everything which existed had a voice and
that all creatures were eternally singing the praise of the Creator. Man
fails to hear these divine melodies because his soul is enmeshed in the
illusion of material existence. When he liberates himself from the
bondage of the lower world with its sense limitations, *the music of the
spheres* will again be audible as it was in the Golden Age. Harmony
recognizes harmony, and when the human soul regains its true estate it
will not only hear the celestial choir but also join with it in an
everlasting anthem of praise to that Eternal *Good* controlling the
infinite number of parts and conditions of Being.

The Greek Mysteries included in their doctrines a magnificent concept of
the relationship existing between music and form. The elements of
architecture, for example, were considered as comparable to musical
modes and notes, or as having a musical counterpart. Consequently when a
building was erected in which a number of these elements were combined,
the structure was then likened to a musical chord, which was harmonic
only when it fully satisfied the mathematical requirements of harmonic
intervals. The realization of this analogy between sound and form led
Goethe to declare that "architecture is crystallized music."

In constructing their temples of initiation, the early priests
frequently demonstrated their superior knowledge of the principles
underlying the phenomena known as vibration. A considerable part of the
Mystery rituals consisted of invocations and intonements, for which
purpose special sound chambers were constructed. A word whispered in one
of these apartments was so intensified that the reverberations made the
entire building sway and be filled with a deafening roar. The very wood
and stone used in the erection of these sacred buildings eventually
became so thoroughly permeated with the sound vibrations of the
religious ceremonies that when struck they would reproduce the same
tones thus repeatedly impressed into their substances by the rituals.

Every element in Nature has its individual keynote. If these elements
are combined in a composite structure the result is a chord that, if
sounded, will disintegrate the compound into its integral parts.
Likewise each individual has a keynote that, if sounded, will destroy
him. The allegory of the walls of Jericho falling when the trumpets of
Israel were sounded is undoubtedly intended to set forth the arcane
significance of individual keynote or vibration.

### THE PHILOSOPHY OF COLOR

"Light," writes Edwin D. Babbitt, "reveals the glories of the external
world and yet is the most glorious of them all. It gives beauty, reveals
beauty and is itself most beautiful. It is the analyzer, the
truth-teller and the exposer of shams, for it shows things as they are.
Its infinite streams measure off the universe and flow into our
telescopes from stars which are quintillions of miles distant. On the
other hand it descends to objects inconceivably small, and reveals
through the microscope objects fifty millions of times less than can be
seen by the naked eye. Like all other fine forces, its movement is
wonderfully soft, yet penetrating and powerful. Without its vivifying
influence, vegetable, animal, and human life must immediately perish
from the earth, and general ruin take place. We shall do well, then, to
consider this potential and beautiful principle of light and its
component colors, for the more deeply we penetrate into its inner laws,
the more will it present itself as a marvelous storehouse of power to
vitalize, heal, refine, and delight mankind." (See *The Principles of
Light and Color*.)

Since light is the basic physical manifestation of life, bathing all
creation in its radiance, it is highly important to realize, in part at
least, the subtle nature of this divine substance. That which is called
*light* is actually a rate of vibration causing certain reactions upon
the optic nerve. Few realize how they are walled in by the limitations

[![THE THEORY OF ELEMENTAL MUSIC.](tn/08300.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/08300.jpg.md)  
THE THEORY OF ELEMENTAL MUSIC.  

From Fludd's *De Musica Mundana*.

In this diagram two interpenetrating pyramids are again employed, one of
which represents fire and the other earth. It is demonstrated according
to the law of elemental harmony that fire does not enter into the
composition of earth nor earth into the composition of fire. The figures
on the chart disclose the harmonic relationships existing between the
four primary elements according to both Fludd and the Pythagoreans.
Earth consists of four parts of its own nature; water of three parts of
earth and one part of fire. The sphere of equality is a hypothetical
point where there is an equilibrium of two parts of earth and two parts
of fire. Air is composed of three parts of fire and one part of earth;
fire, of four parts of its own nature. Thus earth and water bear to each
other the ratio of 4 to 3, or the diatessaron harmony, and water and the
sphere of equality the ratio of 3 to 2, or the diapente harmony. Fire
and air also bear to each other the ratio of 4 to 3, or the diatessaron
harmony, and air and the sphere of equality the ratio of 3 to 2, or the
diapente harmony. As the sum of a diatessaron and a diapente equals a
diapason, or octave, it is evident that both the sphere of fire and the
sphere of earth are in diapason harmony with the sphere of equality, and
also that fire and earth are in disdiapason harmony with each other.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

of the sense perceptions. Not only is there a great deal more to light
than anyone has ever seen but there are also unknown forms of light
which no optical equipment will ever register. There are unnumbered
colors which cannot be seen, as well as sounds which cannot be heard,
odors which cannot be smelt, flavors which cannot be tasted, and
substances which cannot be felt. Man is thus surrounded by a
supersensible universe of which he knows nothing because the centers of
sense perception within himself have not been developed sufficiently to
respond to the subtler rates of vibration of which that universe is
composed.

Among both civilized and savage peoples color has been accepted as a
natural language in which to couch their religious and philosophical
doctrines. The ancient city of Ecbatana as described by Herodotus, its
seven walls colored according to the seven planets, revealed the
knowledge of this subject possessed by the Persian Magi. The famous
*zikkurat* or astronomical tower of the god Nebo at Borsippa ascended in
seven great steps or stages, each step being painted in the key color of
one of the planetary bodies. (See Lenormant's *Chaldean Magic*.) It is
thus evident that the Babylonians were familiar with the concept of the
spectrum in its relation to the seven Creative Gods or Powers. In India,
one of the Mogul emperors caused a fountain to be made with seven
levels. The water pouring down the sides through specially arranged
channels changed color as it descended, passing sequentially through all
shades of the spectrum. In Tibet, color is employed by the native
artists to express various moods. L. Austine Waddell, writing of
Northern Buddhist art, notes that in Tibetan mythology "White and yellow
complexions usually typify mild moods, while the red, blue, and black
belong to fierce forms, though sometimes light blue, as indicating the
sky, means merely celestial. Generally the gods are pictured white,
goblins red, and devils black, like their European relative." (See *The
Buddhism of Tibet*.)

In *Meno*, Plato, speaking through Socrates, describes color as "an
effluence of form, commensurate with sight, and sensible." In
*Theætetus* he discourses more at length on the subject thus: "Let us
carry out the principle which has just been affirmed, that nothing is
self-existent, and then we shall see that every color, white, black, and
every other color, arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate motion,
and that what we term the substance of each color is neither the active
nor the passive element, but something which passes between them, and is
peculiar to each percipient; are you certain that the several colors
appear to every animal--say a dog--as they appear to you?"

In the Pythagorean *tetractys*--the supreme symbol of universal forces
and processes--are set forth the theories of the Greeks concerning color
and music. The first three dots represent the threefold White Light,
which is the Godhead containing potentially all sound and color. The
remaining seven dots are the colors of the spectrum and the notes of the
musical scale. The colors and tones are the active creative powers
which, emanating from the First Cause, establish the universe. The seven
are divided into two groups, one containing three powers and the other
four a relationship also shown in the *tetractys*. The higher
group--that of three--becomes the spiritual nature of the created
universe; the lower group--that of four--manifests as the irrational
sphere, or inferior world.

In the Mysteries the seven *Logi*, or Creative Lords, are shown as
streams of force issuing from the mouth of the Eternal One. This
signifies the spectrum being extracted from the white light of the
Supreme Deity. The seven Creators, or Fabricators, of the inferior
spheres were called by the Jews the *Elohim*. By the Egyptians they were
referred to as the *Builders* (sometimes as the *Governors*) and are
depicted with great knives in their hands with which they carved the
universe from its primordial substance. Worship of the planets is based
upon their acceptation as the cosmic embodiments of the seven creative
attributes of God. The Lords of the planets were described as dwelling
within the body of the sun, for the true nature of the sun, being
analogous to the white light, contains the seeds of all the tone and
color potencies which it manifests.

There are numerous arbitrary arrangements setting forth the mutual
relationships of the planets, the colors, and the musical notes. The
most satisfactory system is that based upon the *law of the octave*. The
sense of hearing has a much wider scope than that of sight, for whereas
the ear can register from nine to eleven octaves of sound the eye is
restricted to the cognition of but seven fundamental color tones, or one
tone short of the octave. Red, when posited as the lowest color tone in
the scale of chromatics, thus corresponds to *do*, the first note of the
musical scale. Continuing the analogy, orange corresponds to *re*,
yellow to *mi*, green to *fa*, blue to *sol*, indigo to *la*, and violet
to *si* (*ti*). The eighth color tone necessary to complete the scale
should be the higher octave of red, the first color tone. The accuracy
of the above arrangement is attested by two striking facts: (1) the
three fundamental notes of the musical scale--the first, the third, and
the fifth--correspond with the three primary colors--red, yellow, and
blue; (2) the seventh, and least perfect, note of the musical scale
corresponds with purple, the least perfect tone of the color scale.

In *The Principles of Light and Color*, Edwin D. Babbitt confirms the
correspondence of the color and musical scales: "As C is at the bottom
of the musical scale and made with the coarsest waves of air, so is red
at the bottom of the chromatic scale and made with the coarsest waves of
luminous ether. As the musical note B \[the seventh note of the scale\]
requires 45 vibrations of air every time the note C at the lower end of
the scale requires 24, or but little over half as many, so does extreme
violet require about 300 trillions of vibrations of ether in a second,
while extreme red requires only about 450 trillions, which also are but
little more than half as many. When one musical octave is finished
another one commences and progresses with just twice as many vibrations
as were used in the first octave, and so the same notes are repeated on
a finer scale. In the same way when the scale of colors visible to the
ordinary eye is completed in the violet, another octave of finer
invisible colors, with just twice as many vibrations, will commence and
progress on precisely the same law."

When the colors are related to the twelve signs of the zodiac, they are
arranged as the spokes of a wheel. To Aries is assigned pure red; to
Taurus, red-orange; to Gemini, pure orange; to Cancer, orange-yellow; to
Leo, pure yellow; to Virgo, yellow-green; to Libra, pure green; to
Scorpio, green-blue; to Sagittarius, pure blue; to Capricorn,
blue-violet; to Aquarius, pure violet; and to Pisces, violet-red.

In expounding the Eastern system of esoteric philosophy, H. P, Blavatsky
relates the colors to the septenary constitution of man and the seven
states of matter as follows:

|        |                                           |                           |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| COLOR  | PRINCIPLES OF MAN                         | STATES OF MATTER          |
| Violet | *Chaya*, or Etheric Double                | Ether                     |
| Indigo | Higher *Manas*, or Spiritual Intelligence | Critical State called Air |
| Blue   | Auric Envelope                            | Steam or Vapor            |
| Green  | Lower *Manas*, or Animal Soul             | Critical State            |
| Yellow | *Buddhi*, or Spiritual Soul               | Water                     |
| Orange | *Prana*, or Life Principle                | Critical State            |
| Red    | *Kama Rupa*, or Seat of Animal Life       | Ice                       |

 

This arrangement of the colors of the spectrum and the musical notes of
the octave necessitates a different grouping of the planets in order to
preserve their proper tone and color analogies. Thus *do* becomes Mars;
*re*, the sun; *mi*, Mercury; *fa*, Saturn; *sol*, Jupiter; *la*, Venus;
*si* (*ti*) the moon. (See *The E. S. Instructions*.)

THE FOUR ELEMENTS AND THEIR CONSONANTAL INTERVALS.  

From Fludd's *De Musica Mundana*.

In this diagram Fludd has divided each of the four Primary elements into
three subdivisions. The first division of each element is the grossest,
partaking somewhat of the substance directly inferior to itself (except
in the case of the earth, which has no state inferior to itself). The
second division consists of the element in its relatively pure state,
while the third division is that condition wherein the element partakes
somewhat of the substance immediately superior to itself. For example
the lowest division of the element of water is sedimentary, as it
contains earth substance in solution; the second division represents
water in its most common state--salty--as in the case of the ocean; and
the third division is water in its purest state--free from salt. The
harmonic interval assigned to the lowest division of each element is one
tone, to the central division also a tone, but to the higher division a
half-tone because it partakes of the division immediately above it.
Fludd emphasizes the fact that as the elements ascend in series of two
and a half tones, the diatessaron is the dominating harmonic interval of
the elements.
