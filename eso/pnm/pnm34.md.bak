### CHAPTER XXV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">What Things Are Saturnine, or Under the Power of Saturn</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Saturnine</span> things, amongst Elements, are
earth and also water; amongst humors, black choler that is moist, as
well natural as adventitious (adust choler excepted). Amongst tastes,
sour, tart, and dead-like. Amongst metals, lead, and gold, by reason of
its weight, and the golden marcasite. Amongst stones, the onyx, the
ziazza, the camonious, the sapphire, the brown jasper, the chalcedon,
the loadstone, and all dark, weighty, earthy things. Amongst plants and
trees, the daffodil, dragon's-wort, rue, cummin, hellebore, the tree
from whence benzoin comes, mandrake, opium, and those things which are
never sown,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

and never bear fruit, and those which bring forth berries of a dark
color and black fruit, as the black fig-tree, the pine-tree, the
cypress-tree, and a certain tree used at burials, which never springs
afresh with berries, rough, of a bitter taste, of a strong smell, of a
black shadow, yielding a most sharp pitch, bearing a most unprofitable
fruit, never dies with age, deadly, and dedicated to Pluto. As is the
herb pas-flower, <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md) with which they
were wont, anciently, to

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

strow the graves before they put the dead bodies into them; wherefore it
was lawful to make their garlands at feasts with all herbs and flowers
besides pas-flowers, because it was mournful and not conducing to mirth.
Also all creeping animals, living apart, and solitary, nightly, sad,
contemplative, dull, covetous, fearful, melancholy, that take much
pains, slow, that feed grossly, and such as eat their young. Of these
kinds, therefore, are the mole, the wolf, the ass, the toad, the cat,
the hog, the bear, the camel, the basilisk, the hare, the ape, the
dragon, the mule, all serpents and creeping things, scorpions, ants, and
such things as proceed from putrefaction in the earth, in water, or in
the ruins of houses, as mice and many sorts of vermin. 'Amongst birds,
those are Saturnine which have long necks and harsh voices, as

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

cranes, ostriches, and peacocks, which are dedicated to Saturn and Juno.
Also the screech-owl, the horned-owl, the bat, the lapwing, the crow,
the quail, which is the most envious bird of all. Amongst fishes, the
eel, living apart from all other fish; the lamprey, the dog-fish, which
devours her young; also the tortoise, oysters, cockles, to which may be
added sea-sponges and all such things as come of them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[102:\*](pnm34.htm#fr_24.md) Pas, from the Latin
word "passus," meaning step, pace, or "right of going foremost;
precedence." Thus the pas-flower means a plant blooming ahead of other
flowers. A co-ordinate word is "pascha," meaning to "pass over," giving
the name "Passover," or the feast of Easter. "Pasch" comes from and
means the same as "pascha," and we read of the "pasch" egg, stained and
given to children at Easter, as also of the "pasch" flower of Easter.
The Easter flower was also known as the Pash-flower, Paschal-flower, and
Pasque-flower—"pash" and "pasque" meaning Easter, and "paschal"
pertaining thereto. This indicates that the pas-flower in the above text
is identical with the pasque-flower, of the genus Anemone, having large
purple flowers, which usually bloom about Easter, stepping foremost in
their- order of blooming as regarding other flowers. Agrippa also makes
mention here of the pas-flower as being an emblem of mourning as the
ancients used it to "strow the graves before they put the dead bodies
into them." While the ancients may have held the pas-flower as sacred to
the rites of burial, the sense of its use as the Easter flower would
indicate that it was also used as an emblem of great joy, and signified
a new life for the departed through a new birth or resurrection. A true
understanding of the meaning of the feast of the Passover or Easter will
show this: Easter-day is always the first Sunday after the fourteenth
day of the calendar moon which comes upon or next after the 21st of
March; so that if the fourteenth day comes on a Sunday, Easter-day will
be the Sunday after. Easter corresponds to the Passover of the Jews, and
"most nations still give it this name under the various forms of pascha,
pasque, paque, or pask." The feast of the Passover was instituted by the
Jews "to commemorate the providential escape of the Hebrews, in Egypt,
when God, smiting the first-born of the Egyptians, <span
class="smallcaps">passed over</span> the houses of the Israelites, which
were marked with the blood of the <span class="smallcaps">paschal
lamb</span>." With the Christian church it is observed to commemorate
the "<span class="smallcaps">resurrection</span> of Christ." The Old
High Germans celebrated the day in honor of Ostara, the goddess of <span
class="smallcaps">light</span> or <span class="smallcaps">spring</span>,
whence they called April (the month of or following Easter) Ostarmanoth.
The Anglo-Saxons called the same month, Eastermonadh, from Eastre, their
name for the same goddess, and their paschal feast, Eastran or Easter.
March was named from Mars, the god of war, and was originally the first
month of the year as it was in March that the Sun came to Aries, the
first House of the Zodiac, emblemized by the <span
class="smallcaps">lamb</span>, as the ram was the first animal to forage
for food and procreate; and the Sun entering <span id="page_103">p.
103</span> the first House was the vernal equinox, or the first day of
spring, the first season of the fruitful year, and therefore March,
being the advent month of light and fecundity, was esteemed as the first
month of the year. The first full month of light and spring, when every
fetter of winter was riven and spring was opened wide and fixed, was
April, from aperio, to open; and also from the Greek word,
aphros—foam—from which Venus was said to have sprung, and hence this
month was sacred to her; no doubt Ostara and Eastre were identical with
her. As Easter-day falls the first Sunday after the fourteenth day of
the calendar moon which comes upon or next after the 21st of March,
Easter-day usually comes in April and dates its arrival from the aspect
of the Moon to the arbitrary date of March 21. This is a very
significant fact and is fully confirmed as such when we find that the
21st of March is the usually precise date when the Earth, in its annual
movement around the Sun, enters Libra, causing the Sun to apparently
enter the opposite House or Sign of Aries, ending winter and ushering in
spring, for the first day of spring always comes when the Sun enters
Aries. Aries is the House of the <span class="smallcaps">lamb</span>,
and with the birth of spring the lamb is resurrected or brought to life
anew, while winter is dead, the Sun having <span
class="smallcaps">passed over</span> the meridian line between winter
and spring. Further, the word Easter corresponds with Aries, for it
springs from the word East, and Aries is the Eastern part of the Zodiac.
Therefore, March 21st is the true Eastern-day, but the celebration of
the return of spring is fitly deferred until the first Sun-day after
about a lunar cycle, so as to partake of the first fruits of the spring
season. In view of the foregoing, therefore, the ancients used the
pas-flower at the grave as an emblem of the passing over of the winter
of old age and the resurrection of the spirit to eternal light and
immortal youth. lased as such the pas-flower or pasque-flower typified
joy and hope.
