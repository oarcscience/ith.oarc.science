### CHAPTER XXXIV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">How, by Natural Things and Their Virtues, We May Draw Forth and Attract the Influences and Virtues of Celestial Bodies</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Now</span>, if thou desirest to receive virtue
from any part of the World, or from any Star, thou shalt (those things
being used which belong to this Star) come under its peculiar influence,
as wood is fit to receive flame by reason of sulphur, pitch and oil.
Nevertheless, when thou dost do any one species of things, or
individual, rightly apply many things (which are things of the same
subject, scattered, amongst themselves, conformable to the same *Idea*
and Star), presently, by this matter so opportunely fitted, a singular
gift is infused by the *Idea*, by means of the Soul of the World. I say
"opportunely fitted," viz., under a harmony, like to the harmony which
did infuse a certain virtue into the matter. For although things have
some virtues, such as we speak of, yet those virtues do so lie hid that
there is seldom any effect produced by them. But, as in a grain of
mustard-seed, bruised, the sharpness which lay hid is stirred up; and as
the heat of the fire doth make letters apparent to the sight which
before could not be read, being writ with the juice of an onion, or with
milk; and as letters wrote upon a stone with the fat of a goat, and
altogether unperceived, when the stone is put into

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

vinegar appear and shew themselves; and as a blow with a stick stirs up
the madness of a dog which before lay asleep—so doth the Celestial
Harmony disclose virtues lying in the water; stirs them up,
strengtheneth them, and makes them manifest; and as I may so say,
produceth that into *Act* which before was only in *Power*, when things
are rightly exposed to it in a Celestial Season. As for example: If thou
dost desire to attract virtue from the Sun, and to seek those things
that are Solary, amongst vegetables, plants, metals, stones, and
animals, those things are to be used and taken chiefly which in a Solary
order are higher. For these are more available. So thou shalt draw a
singular gift from the Sun, through the beams thereof, being seasonably
received together, and through the Spirit of the World.
