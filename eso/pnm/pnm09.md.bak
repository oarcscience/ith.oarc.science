### TRITHEMIUS TO AGRIPPA.

<span class="smallcaps">John Trithemius, Abbot of Saint James of
Herbipolis, Formerly of Spanhemia, to his Henry Cornelius Agrippa of
Nettesheim, Health and Love</span>:

<span class="smallcaps">Your</span> work, most renowned Agrippa,
entitled *Of Occult Philosophy*, which you have sent by this bearer to
me, has been examined. With how much pleasure I received it no mortal
tongue can express nor the pen of any write. I wondered at your more
than vulgar learning—that you, being so young, should penetrate into
such secrets as have been hid from most learned men; and not only
clearly and truly but also properly and elegantly set them forth. Whence
first I give you thanks for your good will to me, and, if I shall ever
be able, I shall return you thanks to the utmost of my power. Your work,
which no learned man can sufficiently commend, I approve of. Now that
you may proceed toward higher things, as you have begun, and not suffer
such excellent parts of wit to be idle, I do, with as much earnestness
as I can, advise, intreat and beseech you that you would exercise
yourself in laboring after better things, and demonstrate the light of
true wisdom to the ignorant, according as you yourself are divinely
enlightened. Neither let the consideration of idle, vain fellows
withdraw you from your purpose; I say of them, of whom it is said, "The
wearied ox treads hard," whereas no man, to the judgment of the wise,
can be truly learned who is sworn to the rudiments of one only faculty.
But you have been by God gifted with a large and sublime wit, and it is
not that you should imitate oxen but rather birds; neither think it
sufficient that you study about particulars, but

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

bend your mind confidently to universals; for by so much the more
learned any one is thought, by how much fewer things he is ignorant of.
Moreover, your wit is fully apt to all things, and to be rationally
employed, not in a few or low things, but many and sublimer. Yet this
one rule I advise you to observe—that you communicate vulgar secrets to
vulgar friends, but higher and secret to higher and secret friends only:
Give hay to an ox, sugar to a parrot only. Understand my meaning, lest
you be trod under the oxen's feet, as oftentimes it falls out. Farewell,
my happy friend, and if it lie in my power to serve you, command me, and
according to your pleasure it shall without delay be done; also, let our
friendship increase daily; write often to me, and send me some of your
labors I earnestly pray you. Again farewell.

*From our Monastery of Peapolis, the 8th day of April, A. D. MDX*.

In January, 1531, Agrippa wrote from Mechlin to Hermann of Wied,
Archbishop of Cologne, to whom he dedicated his Occult Philosophy. In
this letter he says: "Behold! amongst such things as were closely laid
up—the books Of Occult Philosophy, or of Magic," "a new work of most
ancient and abstruse learning;" "a doctrine of antiquity, by none, I
dare say, hitherto attempted to be restored." "I shall be devotedly
yours if these studies of my youth shall by the authority of your
greatness come into knowledge," "seeing many things in them seemed to
me, being older, as most profitable, so most necessary to be known. You
have therefore the work, not only of my youth but of my present age,"
"having added many things."
