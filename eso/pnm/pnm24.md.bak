### CHAPTER XV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">How We Must Find Out and Examine the Virtues of Things by Way of Similitude</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is now manifest that the occult
properties in things are not from the nature of the Elements, but
infused from above, hid from our senses, and scarce at last known by our
reason, which indeed come from the Life and the Spirit of the World,
through the rays of the Stars; and can no otherwise but by experience
and conjecture be inquired into by us. Wherefore, he that desires to
enter upon this study must consider that every thing moves and turns
itself to its like, and inclines that to itself with all its might, as
well in property, viz., Occult Virtue, as in quality, viz., Elementary
Virtue. Sometimes also in substance itself, as we see in salt, for
whatsoever hath long stood with salt becomes salt; for every agent, when
it hath begun to act, doth not attempt to make a thing inferior to
itself, but, as much as may be, like and suitable to itself. Which also
we manifestly see in sensible animals, in which the nutritive virtue
doth not change the meat into an herb or a plant, but turns it into
sensible flesh. In what things, therefore, there is an excess of any
quality or property, as heat, cold, boldness, fear, sadness, anger,
love, hatred, or any other passion or virtue (whether it be in them by
nature or, sometimes also, by art or chance, as boldness in a wanton),
these things do very much move and provoke to such a quality, passion or
virtue. So fire moves to fire, and water moves to water, and he that is
bold moves to boldness. And it is well known

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

amongst physicians that brain helps the brain, and lungs the lungs. So
also it is said that the right eye of a frog helps the soreness of a
man's right eye, and the left eye thereof helps the soreness of his left
eye, if they be hanged about his neck in a cloth of its natural color.
The like is reported of the eyes of a crab. So the feet of a tortoise
helps them that have the gout in their being applied thus—as foot to
foot, hand to hand, right to right, left to left.

After this manner they say that any animal that is barren causeth
another to be barren, and of the animal especially the generative parts.
So they report that a female shall be barren if, betimes, drink be made
of a certain sterile animal, or anything steeped therewith. If, however,
we would obtain any property or virtue, let us seek such animals, or
such other things whatsoever, in which such a property is in a more
eminent manner than in any other thing, and in these let us take that
part in which such a property or virtue is most vigorous; as if at any
time we would promote love, let us seek some animal which is most
loving, of which kind are pigeons, turtles, sparrows, swallows,
wagtails, and in these take those members or parts in which the vital
virtue is most vigorous, such as the heart, breast, and also like parts.
And it must be done at that time when these animals have this affection
most intense, for then they do provoke and draw love. In like manner, to
increase boldness, let us look for a lion, or a cock, and of these let
us take the heart, eyes or forehead. And so we must understand that
which Psellus the Platonist saith, viz., that dogs, crows, and cocks
conduce much to watchfulness, also the nightingale and bat and horned
owl, and in these the heart, head and eyes especially. Therefore, it is
said, if any shall carry the heart of a crow or a bat about him, he
shall not sleep till he cast it away from him. The same doth the head of
a bat, dried and bound to the right arm of him that is

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

awake, for if it be put upon him when he is asleep, it is said that he
shall not be awaked till it be taken off from him. After the same manner
doth a frog and an owl make one talkative, and of these specially the
tongue and heart. So the tongue also of a water-frog, laid under the
head, makes a man speak in his sleep; and the heart of a screech-owl,
laid upon the left breast of a woman that is asleep, is said to make her
utter all her secrets. The same also the heart of the horned owl is said
to do, also the suet of a hare, laid upon the breast of one that is
asleep. Upon the same account do animals that are long lived conduce to
long life; and whatsoever things have a power in themselves to renew
themselves conduce to the renovation of our body and restoring of youth,
which physicians have often professed they know to be true; as is
manifest of the viper and snake. And it is known that harts renew their
old age by the eating of snakes. After the same manner the phœnix is
renewed by a fire which she makes for herself; and the like virtue there
is in a pelican, whose right foot being put under warm dung, after three
months there is of that generated a pelican. Therefore some physicians
by some certain confections made of vipers, and hellebore, and the flesh
of some such kind of animals, do restore youth, and indeed do sometimes
restore it so, as Medea restored old Pileas. It is also believed that
the blood of a bear, if it be sucked out of her wound, doth increase
strength of body, because that animal is the strongest creature.
