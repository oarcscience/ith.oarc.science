### CHAPTER LV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">How Auspicias Are Verified by the Light of Natural Instinct, and of Some Rules of Finding It Out</span>.

[AUSPICIA](errata.htm#4.md) and Auguria, which foretell things to come by
animals and birds, Orpheus, the divine, himself, as we read, did teach
and show first of all, which afterwards were had in great esteem with
all nations. Now they are verified by the light of natural instinct, as
if from this some lights of divination may descend upon four-footed
beasts, those winged, and other creatures, by which they are able to
presage to us of the events of things; which Virgil seems to be sensible
of when he sings:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Nor think I Heaven on them such knowledge states,  
Nor that their prudence is above the Fates.</span>

</div>

Now, this Instinct of Nature, as saith William of Paris, is more sublime
than all human apprehension, and very near, and most like to prophecy.
By this instinct there is a certain wonderful light of divination in
some animals naturally, as is manifested in some dogs, who know thieves
by this instinct and men that are hid, unknown both to themselves and
men, and find them out and apprehend them, falling upon them with a full
mouth. By the like instinct vultures foresee future slaughters in
battles, and gather together into places where they shall be, as if they
foresaw the flesh of dead carcasses. By the same instinct partridges
know their dam, whom they never saw, and leave the partridge which stole
away her dam's eggs and sate upon them. By the same instinct, also,
certain hurtful and terrible things are perceived, the soul being
ignorant of them, whence terror and horror ceaseth when men think
nothing of these things. So a thief, lying hid in a house, al-

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

though no one knows or thinks of his being there, strikes fear and
terror and a troublesomeness of mind into the inhabitants of that house,
although, haply, not of all, because the brightness of this instinct is
not common to all men, yet possessed of some of them. So an evil person,
being hid in some large building, is sometimes perceived to be there by
some one that is altogether ignorant of their being there. It is
mentioned in history that Heraiscus, a certain Egyptian, a man of a
divine nature, could discern evil persons, not only by his eyes but also
by their voice, he hearing them afar off, and thereupon did fall into a
most grievous headache. William of Paris also makes mention of a certain
woman in his time that, by the same instinct, perceived a man whom she
loved coming two miles off. He relates, also, that in his time a certain
stork was convicted of unchastity by the smell of the male, who, being
judged guilty by a multitude of storks whom the male gathered together,
discovering to them the fault of his mate, was, her feathers being
pulled off, torn in pieces by them. The same doth Varro, Aristotle and
Pliny relate concerning horses. And Pliny makes mention of a certain
serpent, called the asp, that did such a like thing, for she, coming to
a certain man's table in Egypt, was there daily fed, and she, having
brought forth some young, by one of which a son of her host was killed,
after she knew of it, killed that young one, and would never return to
that house any more. Now, by these examples, you see how the lights of
presage may descend upon some animals, as signs, or marks of things, and
are set in their gesture, motion, voice, flying, going, meat, color, and
such like. For, according to the doctrine of the Platonists, there is a
certain power put into inferior things by which, for the most part, they
agree with the superiors; whence also the tacit consents of animals seem
to agree with divine bodies, and their bodies and

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

affections to be affected with their powers, by the name of which they
are ascribed to the deities. We must consider, therefore, what animals
are Saturnine, what are Jovial and what Marital, and so of the rest;
and, according to their properties, to draw forth their presages; so
those birds which resemble Saturn and Mars, are all of them called
terrible and deadly, as the screech owl, the hawlet, and others which we
have mentioned before; also the horn owl, because she is a Saturnine,
solitary bird, also nightly, and is reputed to be most unfortunately
ominous, of which the poet saith:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The ugly Owl, which no bird well resents,  
Foretells misfortunes and most sad events.</span>

</div>

But the swan is a delicious bird, under Venus, and dedicated to Phœbus,
and is said to be most happy in her presages, especially in the auspices
of mariners, for she is never drowned in water, whence Ovid Sings:

Most happy is the cheerful, singing Swan In her presages——

There are also some birds that presage with their mouth and singing, as
the crow, pie, and daw, whence Virgil:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             —This did foreshow  
Oft from the hollow holm that ominous Crow.</span>

</div>

Now, the birds that portend future things by their flying are, viz.,
buzzards, the bone-breakers, vultures, eagles, cranes, swans, and the
like, for they are to be considered in their flying, whether they fly
slowly or swiftly; whether to the right hand or to the left; how many
fly together. Upon this account, if cranes fly apace, they signify a
tempest; and, when slowly, fair weather. When two eagles fly together,
they are said to portend evil, because two is a number of confusion. In
like manner thou shalt enquire into the reason of the rest, as this is
shown by number. Moreover, it

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

belongs to an artist to observe a similitude in these conjectures, as in
Virgil, Venus, dissembling, teacheth her son, Æneas, in these verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        —All this is not for naught,  
Else me in vain my parents Augury taught;  
Lo! twice six Swans in a glad company  
Jove's bird pursued through the etherial Sky  
In Heaven's broad tracks; now earth in a long train  
They seem to take, or taken, to disdain;  
As they return with sounding wings they sport,  
And Heaven surrounding in a long consort.  
Just so, I say, thy friends and fleet have gained  
The port, or with full sails the Bay obtained.</span>

</div>

Most wonderful is that kind of auguring of theirs, who hear and
understand the speeches of animals, in which, as amongst the ancients,
Melampus, [Tiresias](errata.htm#5.md), Thales, and Apollonius, the Tyanean,
who, as we read, excelled, and whom, they report, had excellent skill in
the language of birds; of whom Philostratus and Porphyrius speak,
saying, that of old, when Apollonius sat in company amongst his friends,
seeing sparrows sitting upon a tree, and one sparrow coming from
elsewhere unto him, making a great chattering and noise, and then flying
away, all the rest following him, he said to his companions that that
sparrow told the rest that an ass, being burdened with wheat, fell down
in a hole near the city and that the wheat was scattered upon the
ground. Many, being much moved with these words, went to see, and so it
was, as Apollonius said, at which they much wondered. Phorphyrius, the
Platonist, in his third book of sacrifices, saith that there is
certainly a swallow language, because every voice of every animal is
significative of some passion of its soul, as joy, sadness, or anger, or
the like, which voices, it is not so wonderful a thing, could be
understood by men conversant about them. But Democritus himself declared
this art, as saith Pliny, by naming the birds, of whose blood mixed
together was produced a serpent, of which whosoever did eat should
understand the voices of birds. And

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hermes saith that
if any one shall go forth to catch birds on a certain day of the Kalends
of November, and shall boil the first bird that he catcheth with the
heart of a fox, that all that shall eat of this bird shall understand
the voices of birds and all other animals. Also, the Arabians say that
they can understand the meaning of brutes who shall eat the heart and
liver of a dragon. Proclus, also, the Platonist, believed and wrote that
the heart of a mole conduceth to presages. There were also divinations
and auspices which were taken from the inwards of sacrifices, the
inventor whereof was Tages, of whom Lucan sang:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And if the Inwards have no credit gained,  
And if this Art by Tages was but feigned.</span>

</div>

The Roman religion thought that the liver was the head of the inwards.
Hence the soothsayers enquiring after future things in the inwards, did
first look into the liver, in which were two heads, whereof the one was
called the head for the city, the other for the enemy; and the heads of
this, or another part, being compared together, they then gave judgment
and pronounced for victory; as we read, in Lucan, that the inwards did
signify the slaughter of Pompey's men and the victory of Cæsar's,
according to these verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In the inwards all defects are ominous  
One part and branch of the entrails doth increase,  
Another part is weak, and flagging lies,  
Beats, and moves with quick pulse the arteries.</span>

</div>

Then, the bowels being finished, they search the heart. Now, if there
were a sacrifice found without a heart, or a head was wanting in the
liver, these were deadly presages, and were called piacularia. Also, if
a sacrifice fled from the altar, or, being smitten, made a lowing, or
fell upon any part of his body than he ought to do, it was the like
ominous. We read that when Julius Cæsar on a day went forth to
procession with his purple robe, and sitting in a golden chair

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and sacrificing, there was twice a heart wanting. When C. Marius Utica
was sacrificing, there was wanting a liver. Also when Caius, the prince,
and M. Marcellus, C. Claudius and L. Petellius Coss, were offering
sacrifices, that the liver was consumed suddenly away and, not long
after, one of them died of a disease, another was slain by men of
Lyguria, the entrails foretelling so much; which was thought to be done
by the power of the Gods, or help of the devil. Hence it was accounted a
thing of great concernment amongst the ancients as oft as any thing
unusual was found in the inwards, as when Sylla was sacrificing at
Laurentum, the figure of a crown appeared in the head of the liver,
which Posthumius, the soothsayer, interpreted to portend a victory with
a kingdom, and therefore advised that Sylla should eat those entrails
himself. The color, also, of the inwards is to be considered. Of these
Lucan made mention:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Struck at the color Prophets were with fear,  
For with foul spots pale entrals tinged were.  
Both black and blue, with specks of sprinkled blood  
They were—</span>

</div>

There was in times past such a venerable esteem of these arts that the
most potent and wise men sought after them; yea, the senate and kings
did nothing without the counsel of the Augures. But all these in these
days are abolished, partly by the negligence of men and partly by the
authority of the fathers.
