### ORDER OF THE EMPYREAN HEAVEN.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> is a God, all-powerful,
all-intelligent and supremely perfect; eternal and infinite; omnipotent
and omniscient; who endures from eternity to eternity, and is present
from infinity to infinity.

But though, from the nature and perfections of the Deity, he is
invisibly present in all places and nothing happens without his
knowledge and permission; yet it is expressly revealed in Scripture, and
admitted by all wise and intelligent authors, that he is visibly present
with the angels and spirits, and blessed souls of the departed, in those
mansions of bliss called Heaven. There he is pleased to afford a nearer
and more immediate view of himself, and a more sensible manifestation of
his glory, and a more adequate perception of his attributes, than can be
seen or felt in any other parts of the universe; which place, for the
sake of pre-eminent distinction, and as being the seat and center, from
whence all things flow and have their beginning, life, light, power, and
motion, is called the interior or Empyrean Heaven.

The position and order of this interior heaven, or center of the
Divinity, has been variously described, and its locality somewhat
disputed among the learned; but all agree as to the certainty of its
existence. Hermes Trismegistus defines heaven to be an intellectual
sphere, whose center is everywhere, and circumference nowhere, but by
this he meant no

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

more than to affirm, what we have done above, that God is everywhere,
and at all times, from infinity to infinity, that is to say, without
limitation, bounds, or circumference. Plato speaks of this internal
heaven in terms which bear so strict a resemblance with the books of
Revelation, and in so elevated and magnificent a style, that it is
apparent the heathen philosophers, notwithstanding their worshiping demi
or false gods, possessed an unshaken confidence in one omnipotent,
supreme, overruling power, whose throne was the center of all things,
and the abode of angels and blessed spirits.

To describe this interior heaven, in terms adequate to its magnificence
and glory, is utterly impossible. The utmost we can do is to collect,
from inspired writers, and from the words of Revelation, assisted by
occult philosophy, and a due knowledge of the celestial spheres, that
order and position of it, which reason and the divine lights we have,
bring nearest to the truth. That God must be strictly and literally the
center from whence all ideas of the Divine Mind flow, as rays in every
direction, through all spheres and through all bodies, cannot admit of a
doubt. That the inner circumference of this center is surrounded, filled
or formed, by arrangements of the three hierarchies of angels, is also
consonant to reason and Scripture, and forms what may be termed the
entrance or inner gate of the empyrean heaven, through which no spirit
can pass without their knowledge and permission, and within which we
must suppose the vast expanse or mansions of the Godhead, and glory of
the Trinity, to be. This is strictly conformable to the idea of all the
prophets and evangelical writers. From this primary circle, or gate of
heaven, Lucifer, the grand Apostate, as Milton finely describes it, was
hurled into the bottomless abyss; whose office, as one of the highest
orders of angels, having placed him near the eternal throne, he became

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

competitor for dominion and power with God himself.

The circles next surrounding the hierarchies, are

composed of the ministering angels and spirits and messengers of the
Deity. In positions answering to the ideas of the holy Trinity, and
intersecting all

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

orders of angels, are seated, in fullness of glory and splendor, those
superior angels, or intelligent spirits, who answer to the divine
attributes of God, and are the pure essences or stream through which the
will or fiat of the Godhead is communicated to the angels and spirits,
and instantaneously conducted to the Anima Mundi. Round the whole, as an
atmosphere round a planet, the Anima Mundi, or universal Spirit of
Nature, is placed; which, receiving the impressions or ideas of the
Divine Mind, conducts them onward, to the remotest parts of the
universe; to infinity itself; to, and upon, and through, all bodies, and
to all God's works. This Anima Mundi is therefore what we understand of
Nature, of Providence, of the presence of God, and the fountain or seat
of all second causes, being, as it were, the Eye of God, or medium
between God and all created things. Next to the Anima Mundi, is that
vast region or expanse, called the ethereal heaven, or firmament,
wherein the fixed stars, planets, and comets, are disposed; and wherein
the celestial bodies, and the comets, move freely in all directions, and
towards all parts of the heavens.

To illustrate what has been stated above a plate is here inserted of the
Interior Heaven, with the different orders of the Spirits and Essences
of the Divine Mind, distinguished by their proper names and characters,
in the original Hebrew and Iberian text, as pointed out in the
manuscripts of ancient and learned philosophers. This plate shows in
what manner the rays or beams of Divine Providence pass from the center
or seat of the Godhead, through all the different orders of angels and
spirits, to the Anima Mundi, and from thence to all the celestial bodies
planets, and stars; to our earth, and to the remotest parts of infinite
space, constituting what is termed celestial influx, or that faculty in
nature by

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

which the quality and temperature of one body is communicated to
another.

Theologists have divided angels into different ranks or classes, which
they term Hierarchies, a word signifying to rule in holy things. Ancient
authors give nine orders of these celestial spirits—Cherubim, Seraphim,
Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Virtues, Angels, and
Archangels—and these they class into Three Hierarchies, appointing them
their respective offices in the performance of the word and will of God.

The rabbis and cabalistical writers have defined one rank of angels—or
the Intelligences—as superior to all the foregoing nine orders of
spirits, and which answer to and are contained in the ten distinguishing
names of God, and are the pure essences of the Supreme Spirit, or the
Divine Diffusion through which the mirific Word and Will are
communicated to the angels and blessed spirits, and through which
providence extends to the care and protection of Nature.

The first of these divine essences is Jehovah, and is peculiarly
attributed to God the Father, being the pure and simple essence of the
Supreme Divinity, flowing through Hajoth Hakados, to the angel
Metratton, and to the ministering spirit Reschith Hagalalim, who guides
the Primum Mobile, and bestows the gift of being upon all things. To
this spirit is allotted the office of bringing the souls of the faithful
departed into heaven; and by him God spake to Moses.

The second is Jah, and is attributed to the Person of the Messiah, whose
power and influence descend through the angel Masleh into the sphere of
the celestial Zodiac. This is the Spirit of Nature, the Soul of the
World, or the Omnific Word which actuated the chaos and divided the
unwrought matters into three

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

portions: Of the first and most essential part was the Spiritual World
composed; of the second was made the visible heavens or the Celestial
World; and of the third part was formed the Terrestrial World, out of
which was drawn the elemental quintessence, or first matter of all
things, which produced the four elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth,
and all the creatures which inhabit them, by the agency of a particular
spirit called Raziel, who was the ruler of Adam.

The third is Ehjeh, and is attributed to the Holy Spirit, whose divine
light is received by the angel Sabbathi, and communicated from him
through the sphere of Saturn. This is the principium generationis, the
beginning of the ways of God, or the manifestations of the Father and
the Son's light in the supernatural generation. And from hence flow down
all living souls, entering the inanimate body, and giving form to
unsettled matter.

The fourth is El, through the light of whom flows grace, goodness,
mercy, piety, and munificence, to the angel Zadkiel, and, thence,
passing through the. sphere of Jupiter, fashioneth the images of all
bodies, bestowing clemency, benevolence, and justice on all.

The fifth is Elohi, the upholder of the sword, and left hand of God,
whose influence penetrates the angel Geburah, and thence descends
through the sphere of Mars, giving fortitude in war and affliction.

The sixth is Tsebaoth, who bestoweth his mighty power through the angel
Raphael into the sphere of the Sun, giving motion, heat, and brightness
to it, and thence producing metals.

The seventh is Elion, who rules the angel Michael, and descends through
the sphere of Mercury, giving benignity, motion, intelligence, and
eloquence.

The eighth is Adonai, whose influence is received by the angel Haniel,
and communicated through the

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

sphere of Venus, giving zeal, fervency, and righteousness of heart, and
producing vegetables.

The ninth is Shaddai, whose influence is conveyed by cherubim to the
angel Gabriel, and falls into the sphere of the Moon, causing increase
and decrease of all things, like unto the tides of the sea, and
governing the genii and natural protectors of man.

The tenth is Elohim, who extends his beneficence to the angel Jesodoth,
into the sphere of the Earth, and dispenseth knowledge, understanding,
and wisdom.

The three first of these ten names—Jehovah, Jah, and Ehjeh—express the
essence of God, and are proper names; but the other seven are only
expressive of his attributes. The only true name of God, according to
the cabala, is the name of four letters—the
Tetragrammaton—Yod-he-vau-he.

In the exterior circle of the celestial heaven, occupied by the fixed
stars, the Anima Mundi hath her particular forms, answering to the ideas
of the Divine Mind; and this situation approaching nearest to the
Empyrean Heaven, the seat of God, receives the spiritual powers and
influences which immediately proceed from him. Hence they are diffused
through the spheres of the planets and heavenly bodies, and communicated
to the inmost center of the Earth by means of natural law, or the Spirit
of the World, that rules the terrestrial world.

While many ancient authors have contended on the definition and meaning
of the word Nature, yet they all in reality mean one and the same thing,
only giving different explanations of the same ideas; and if their
arguments are closely pursued and compared with each other, they will
all tend to show that the Anima Mundi and the Soul of the Universe is
what they mean by Nature.
