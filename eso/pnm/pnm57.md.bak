### CHAPTER XLVIII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Virtue of Places, and What Places Are Suitable to Every Star</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> be wonderful virtues of places
accompanying them, either from things there placed, or by the influences
of the Stars, or in any other way. For, as Pliny relates of a cuckoo, in
what place any one doth first hear him, if his right foot-print be
marked about and that place dug up, there will no fleas be bred in that
place where it is scattered. So they say that the dust of the track of a
snake, being gathered up and scattered amongst bees, makes them return
to their hives. So, also, that the dust in which a mule hath rolled
himself, being cast upon the body, doth mitigate the heat of passion;
and that the dust wherein a hawk hath rolled herself, if it be bound

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

to the body in a bright red cloth, cures the quartan. So doth the stone
taken out of the nest of a swallow, as they say, presently relieve those
that have the falling sickness, and being bound to the party,
continually preserves them, especially if it be rolled in the blood or
heart of a swallow. And it is reported that if any one shall cut a vein,
being fasting, and shall go over a place where any one lately fell with
the fit of a falling sickness, that he shall fall into the same disease.
And Pliny reports that to fasten an iron nail in that place where he
that fell with a fit of the falling sickness first did pitch his head,
will free him from his disease. So they say that an herb, growing upon
the head of any image, being gathered, and bound up in some part of
one's garment with a red thread, shall presently allay the headache; and
that any herb gathered out of the brooks or rivers before Sunrising, and
no body seeing him that gathers it, shall cure the tertian if it be
bound to the left arm, the sick party not knowing what is done.

Amongst places that are appropriated to the Stars, all stinking places,
and dark, underground, religious, and mournful places, as church-yards,
tombs, and houses not inhabited by men; and old, tottering, obscure,
dreadful houses; and solitary dens, caves, and pits; also fish-ponds,
standing pools, sewers, and such like, are appropriated to Saturn. Unto
Jupiter are ascribed all privileged places, consistories of noblemen,
tribunals, chairs, places for exercise, schools, and all beautiful and
clean places, and those sprinkled with divers odors. To Mars, fiery and
bloody places, furnaces, bakehouses, shambles, places of execution, and
places where there have been great battles fought and slaughters made,
and the like. To the Sun, light places, the serene air, kings’ palaces
and princes’ courts, pulpits, theaters, thrones, and all kingly and
magnificent places. To Venus, pleasant fountains, green meadows,
flourishing gardens, garnished beds,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

stews, and, according to Orpheus, the sea, the seashore, baths, dancing
places, and all places belonging to women. To Mercury, shops, schools,
warehouses, exchanges for merchants, and the like. To the Moon,
wildernesses, woods, rocks, hills, mountains, forests, fountains,
waters, rivers, seas, seashores, ships, highways, groves, granaries for
corn, and such like. On this account they that endeavor to procure love
are wont to bury for a certain time the instruments of their art,
whether they be rings, images, looking-glasses, or any other, or hide
them in a stew house, so that they will contract some virtue under
Venus, the same as those things that stand in stinking places become
stinking, and those in an aromatical place become aromatic and of a
sweet savor.

The four corners of the earth also pertain to this matter. Hence they
that are to gather a Saturnine, Martial, or Jovial herb must look
towards the East or South, partly because they desire to be oriental
from the Sun, and partly because of their principal houses, viz.:
Aquarius, Scorpio and Sagittarius are Southern Signs, so also are
Capricornus and Pisces. But they that will gather a Venereal, Mercury or
Lunary herb must look towards the West because they delight to be
western, or else they must look towards the North because their
principal houses—viz., Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Virgo—are Northern Signs.
So in any Solary work we must look not only towards the East and South
whilst plucking it, but also towards the Solary body and light.
