### CHAPTER VIII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">How the Elements Are in the Heavens, in Stars, in Devils, in Angels, and lastly in God Himself</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">It is</span> the unanimous consent of all
Platonists, that as in the original and exemplary World, all things are
in all; so also in this corporeal world, all things are in all; so also
the Elements are not only in these inferior bodies, but also in the
Heavens, in Stars in Devils, in Angels, and lastly in God, the maker and
original example of all things. Now in these inferior bodies the
Elements are accompanied with much gross matter; but in the Heavens the
Elements are with their natures and virtues, viz., after a celestial

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

and more excellent manner than in sublunary things. For the firmness of
the Celestial Earth is there without the grossness of water; and the
agility of the Air without running over its bounds; the heat of Fire
without burning, only shining and giving life to all things by its heat.
Amongst the Stars, also, some are fiery, as Mars and Sol; airy, as
Jupiter and Venus; watery, as Saturn and Mercury; and earthy, such as
inhabit the eighth *Orb* <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) and the
Moon (which, notwithstanding, by many is accounted watery), seeing, as
if it were Earth, it attracts to itself the celestial waters, with
which, being imbibed, it doth, by reason of its nearness to us, pour out
and communicate to us. There are, also, amongst the Signs, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[†](#fn_12.md) some fiery, some earthy, some airy, some
watery; the Elements rule them also in the Heavens, distributing to them
these four threefold considerations of every Element, viz., the
beginning, middle and end: So Aires possesseth the beginning of fire,
Leo the progress and increase, and Sagittarius the end. Taurus the
beginning of the earth, Virgo the progress, Capricorn the end. Gemini
the beginning of the air, Libra the progress, Aquarius the end. Cancer
the beginning of water, Scorpius the middle, and Pisces the end. Of the
mixtions, therefore, of these Planets and Signs, together with the
Elements, are all bodies made. Moreover, Devils also are upon this
account distinguished the one from the other, so that some are called
fiery, some earthy, some airy, and some watery. Hence, also, those four
Infernal Rivers—fiery Phlegethon, airy Cocytus, watery Styx, earthy
Acheron. Also in the Gospel we read of hell fire, and eternal fire, into
which the cursed shall be commanded to go; and in the Revelation we read
of a lake of fire, and Isaiah speaks of the damned that

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

the Lord will smite them with corrupt air. And in Job, they shall skip
from the waters of the snow to extremity of heat; and in the same we
read, that the Earth is dark, and covered with the darkness of death and
miserable darkness. Moreover, also, these Elements are placed in the
Angels in Heaven and the blessed Intelligences. There is in them a
stability of their essence, which is an earthly virtue, in which is the
steadfast seat of God; also their mercy and piety is a watery cleansing
virtue. Hence by the Psalmist they are called Waters, where he, speaking
of the Heavens, saith, Who rulest the Waters that are higher than the
Heavens. <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) Also in them their subtile
breath is Air, and their love is shining Fire. Hence they are called in
Scripture the Wings of the Wind; and in another place the Psalmist
speaks of them, Who makest Angels thy Spirits and thy Ministers a
flaming fire. Also according to orders of Angels, some are fiery, as
Seraphim, and Authorities and Powers; earthy, as Cherubim; watery, as
Thrones and Archangels; airy, as Dominions and Principalities. Do we not
also read of the original maker of all things, that the earth shall be
opened and bring forth a Savior? It is not spoken of the same that he
shall be a fountain of living Water, cleansing and regenerating? Is not
the same Spirit breathing the breath of life; and the same, according to
Moses’ and Paul's testimony, a consuming Fire? That Elements, therefore,
are to be found everywhere, and in all things after their manner, no man
can deny: First in these inferior bodies seculent and gross, and in
celestials more pure and clear; but in supercelestials living, and in
all respects blessed. Elements, therefore, in the exemplary world are
*Ideas* of things to be produced, in Intelligences are distributed
powers,

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

in Heavens are virtues, and in inferior bodies gross forms.

divisional parts of the Zodiac.

"Waters that be above the Heavens." Gen., i., 6-9, is also noteworthy.
The Watery Triplicity of the Zodiac may properly be termed as "Waters
above the Heavens," or Celestial Waters.
