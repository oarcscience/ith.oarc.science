### CHAPTER IV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of a Three-Fold Consideration of the Elements</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are, then, as we have said, four
Elements, without the perfect knowledge whereof we can effect nothing in
Magic. Now each of them is three-fold, that so the number of four may
make up the number of twelve; and by passing by the number of seven into
the number of ten, there may be a progress to the supreme Unity, upon
which all virtue and wonderful operation depends. Of the first Order are
the pure Elements, which are neither compounded nor changed, nor admit
of mixtion, but are incorruptible, and not of which, but through which
the virtues of all natural things are brought forth into act. No man is
able to declare their virtues, because they can do all things upon all
things. He which is ignorant of these, shall never be able to bring to
pass any wonderful matter. Of the second Order are Elements that are
compounded, changeable and inpure, yet such as may by art be reduced to
their pure simplicity, whose virtue, when they are thus reduced to their
simplicity, doth above all things perfect all occult and common
operations of Nature; and these are the foundation of the whole Natural
Magic. Of the third Order are those Elements, which originally and of
themselves are not Elements, but are twice

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

compounded, various and changeable one into the other. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) They are the infallible *Mediums*, and
therefore are called the middle nature, or Soul of the middle nature.
Very few there are that understand the deep mysteries thereof. In them
is, by means of certain numbers, degrees and orders, the perfection of
every effect in anything soever, whether Natural, Celestial or
Supercelestial; they are full of wonders and mysteries, and are
operative, as in Magic Natural, so in Divine: For from these, through
them, proceed the bindings, loosings and transmutations of all things,
the knowing and foretelling of all things to come, also the driving
forth of evil and the gaining of good spirits. Let no man, therefore,
without these three sorts of Elements, and the knowledge thereof, be
confident that he is able to work any thing in the occult Sciences of
Magic and Nature. But whosoever shall know how to reduce those of one
Order into those of another, impure into pure, compounded into simple,
and shall know how to understand distinctly the nature, virtue and power
of them in number, degrees and order, without dividing the substance, he
shall easily attain to the knowledge and perfect operation of all
Natural things and Celestial secrets.
