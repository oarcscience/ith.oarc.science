### CHAPTER XXIV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">What Things Are Lunary, or Under the Power of the Moon</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">These</span> things are Lunary, amongst the
Elements, viz.: The earth, then the water, as well that of the sea as of
the rivers; and all moist things, as the moisture of trees and animals,
especially they which are white, as the whites of [eggs](errata.htm#2.md),
fat, sweat, phlegm, and the superfluities of bodies. Amongst tastes,
salt and insipid; amongst metals, silver; amongst stones, crystal, the
silver marcasite, and all those stones that are white and green. Also
the stone selenite (*i. e.*, the Moon, Lunary), shining from a white
body, with a yellow brightness; imitating the motion of the Moon, by
having in it the figure of the Moon, which daily increaseth or
decreaseth as doth the Moon. Also pearls, which are generated in shells
of fishes, and stalactites, formed from the droppings

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

of water; also the beryl, or aqua-marine, greenish and six-sided.

Amongst plants and trees, these are Lunary, as the selenotropion, which
turns towards the Moon as doth the heliotropion towards the Sun; and the
palm-tree, which sends forth a bough at every rising of the new Moon.
Hyssop, also, and rosemary, agnus castus, and the olive-tree, are
Lunary. Also the herb chinosta, which increaseth and decreaseth with the
Moon, viz., in substance and number of leaves, not only in sap but in
virtue—which, indeed, is in some sort common to all plants, except
onions, which last are under the influence of Mars, and have contrary
properties.

As amongst flying things the Saturnine bird called a quail is a great
enemy of the Moon and Sun, Lu-nary animals are such as delight to be in
man's company, and such as do naturally excel in love or hatred, as all
kinds of dogs. The chameleon also is Lunary, which always assumes a
color according to the variety of the color of the object—as the Moon
changeth her nature according to the variety of the Sign which it is
found in. Lunary also are swine, hinds, goats, and all those animals,
whatsoever, that observe and imitate the motion of the Moon, as the
baboon, and the panther, which is said to have a spot upon her shoulder
like the Moon, increasing into a roundness and having horns that bend
inwards. Cats also are Lunary, whose eyes become greater or less
according to the course of the Moon; and those things (which are of like
nature, as catamenial blood, of which are made wonderful and strange
things by magicians. The civet cat, also, changing her sex with the
Moon, being obnoxious to divers sorceries; and all animals that live in
water as well as on land, as otters, and such as prey upon fish. Also
all monstrous beasts, such as without any manifest seed are equivocally
generated, as mice, which sometimes

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

seem to be generated of the putrefaction of the earth. Amongst fowl,
geese, ducks, didappers, and all kinds of watery fowl as prey upon fish,
as the heron, and those that are equivocally produced, as wasps of the
carcasses of horses, bees of the putrefaction of cows, small flies of
putrefied wine, and beetles of the flesh of asses. But most Lunary of
all is the two-horned beetle, horned after the manner of a bull, which
digs under cow-dung and there remains for the space of twenty-eight days
(in which time the Moon measures the whole Zodiac), and in the
twenty-ninth day, when it thinks there will be a conjunction of their
brightness, it opens the dung and casts it into water, from whence then
come beetles.

Amongst fish, these are Lunary: Ælurus, whose eyes are changed according
to the course of the Moon, and whatsoever observes the motion of the
Moon, as the tortoise, the echeneis, crabs, oysters, cockles and frogs.
