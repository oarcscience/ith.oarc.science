### CHAPTER L.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of Fascination, and the Art Thereof</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Fascination</span> is a binding, which comes
from the spirit of the witch, through the eyes of him that is so
bewitched, and entering to his heart. Now the instrument of fascination
is the spirit, viz., a certain pure, lucid, subtile vapor, generated of
the purer blood by the heat of the heart. This doth always send forth,
through the eyes, rays like to itself. Those rays, being sent forth, do
carry with them a spiritual vapor, and that vapor a blood (as it appears
in swollen and red eyes), whose rays, being sent forth to the eyes of
him that looks upon them, carry the vapor of the corrupt blood together
with itself;

by the contagion of which it doth infect the eyes of the beholder with
the like disease. So the eye, being opened and intent upon any one with
a strong imagination, doth dart its beams (which are the vehiculum of
the spirit) into the eyes of him that is opposite to him; which tender
spirit strikes the eyes of him that is bewitched, being stirred up from
the heart of him that strikes, and possesseth the breast of him that is
stricken, wounds his heart and infects his spirit. Whence Apuleius
saith, "Thy eyes, sliding down through my eyes into mine inward breast,
stir up a most vehement burning in my marrow." Know, then, that men are
most bewitched when, with often beholding, they direct the edge of their
sight to the edge of the sight of those that bewitch them; and when
their eyes are reciprocally intent one upon the other, and when rays are
joined to rays and lights to lights, the spirit of the one is joined to
the spirit of the other and fixeth its sparks. So are strong ligations
made, and so most vehement loves are inflamed with only the rays of the
eyes; even with a certain sudden looking on, as if it were with a dart
or stroke, penetrating the whole body, whence then the spirit and
amorous blood, being thus wounded, are carried forth upon the lover and
enchanter, no otherwise than the blood and spirit of the vengeance of
him that is slain are upon him that slays him. Whence Lucretius sang
concerning those amorous bewitchings

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The body smitten is, but yet the mind  
Is wounded with the darts of Cupid blind.  
All parts do Sympathize i' th’ wound, but know  
The blood appears in that which had the blow. <span

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

So, great is the power of fascination, especially when the vapors of the
eyes are subservient to the affection. Therefore witches use collyries,
ointments, alligations, and such like, to affect and corroborate the
spirit in this or that manner. To procure love they use venereal
collyries, as hippomanes, the blood of doves, or sparrows, and such
like. To induce fear, they use martial collyries, as of the eyes of
wolves, the civet cat, and the like. To procure misery or sickness, they
use Saturnine things, and so of the rest.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[155:\*](pnm59.htm#fr_30.md) Again, in speaking of
the power of Venus, the goddess of peace, over Mars, the god of war, he
says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      On thy soft bosom he—  
The warlike field who sways—almighty Mars,  
Struck by triumphant Love's eternal wound,  
Reclines full frequent. With uplifted gaze  
On thee he feeds his longing, lingering eyes,  
And all his soul hangs quivering from thy lips.</span>
