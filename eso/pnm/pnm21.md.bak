### CHAPTER XII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">How It Is That Particular Virtues Are Infused into Particular Individuals, even of the Same Species</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are also in many individuals, or
particular things, peculiar gifts, as wonderful as in the species and
these also are from the figure and situation of Celestial Stars. For
every Individual, when it begins to be under a determined Horoscope, and
Celestial Constellation, *contracts* together with its essence a certain
wonderful virtue both of doing and suffering something that is
remarkable, even besides that which it receives from its species; and
this it doth partly by the influence of the Heaven and partly through
that obedientialness, of the matter of things to be generated, to the
Soul of the World, which obedientialness indeed is such as that of our
bodies to our souls. For we perceive that there is this in us, that
according to our conceptions of things our bodies are moved, and that
cheerfully, as when we are afraid of or fly from any thing. So, many
times when the celestial souls conceive several things, then the matter
is moved obediently to it. Also in Nature there appear divers prodigies,
by reason of the imagination of superior motions. So also they conceive
and imagine divers virtues, not only things natural but also sometimes
things artificial, and this especially if the Soul of the operator be
inclined towards the same. Whence Avicen saith, that whatsoever things
are done here, must have been before in the motions and conceptions of
the Stars and Orbs. So in things various effects, inclinations and
dispositions are occasioned not only from the matter variously disposed,
as many suppose, but from a various influence and diverse form; not
truly with a specifical difference, but peculiar and proper.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the degrees of
these are variously distributed by the first cause of all things. God
himself, who being unchangeable, distributes to every one as he
pleaseth, with whom, notwithstanding, second causes, Angelical and
Celestial, co-operate, disposing of the corporeal matter and other
things that are committed to them. All virtues, therefore, are infused
by God, through the Soul of the World, yet by a particular power of
resemblances and intelligences over-ruling them, and concourse of the
rays, and aspects of the Stars in a certain peculiar harmonious consent.
