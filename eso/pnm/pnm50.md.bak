### CHAPTER XLI.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of Sorceries, and Their Power</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> force of sorceries is reported to be
so great that they are believed to be able to subvert, consume and
change all inferior things, according to Virgil's muse:

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Mœris for me these herbs in Pontus chose,  
And curious drugs, for there great plenty grows;  
I, many times, with these have Mœris  
spied Chang’d to a wolfe, and in the woods to hide;  
From Sepulchres would souls departed charm,  
And Corn bear standing from another's Farm.</span>

</div>

Also, in another place, concerning the companions of Ulysses, whom

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The cruel Goddess, Circe, there invests  
With fierce aspects, and chang’d to savage beasts.</span>

</div>

And, a little after,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">When love from Picus, Cerce could not gaine,  
Him, with her charming-wand, and hellish bane,  
Chang’d to a bird, and spots his speckled wings  
With sundry colors——</span>

</div>

Now, there are some kinds of these sorceries mentioned by Lucan
concerning that sorceress, Thessala, calling up ghosts, where he saith:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Here all Nature's products unfortunate:  
Foam of mad Dogs, which waters fear and hate;  
Guts of the Lynx; Hyena's, knot imbred;  
The marrow of a Hart with Serpents fed  
Were not wanting; no, nor the sea Lamprey,  
Which stops the ships; nor yet the Dragon's eye.</span>

</div>

And such as Apuleius tells of concerning Pamphila, that sorceress,
endeavoring to procure love; to whom Fotis, a certain maid, brought the
hairs of a goat (cut off from a bag or bottle made with the skin
thereof) instead of Bæotius’ (a young man) hair. Now she, saith
Apuleius, being out of her wits for the young man, goeth up to the tiled
roof and, in the upper part thereof, makes a great hole open to all the
oriental and other aspects, and most fit for these her arts, and there
privately worships; having before furnished her mournful house with
suitable furniture, with all kinds of spices, with plates of iron with
strange words engraven upon them, with parts of sterns of ships that
were cast

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

away and much lamented, and with divers members of buried carcasses cast
abroad—here noses and fingers, there the fleshy nails of those that were
hanged, and, in another place, the blood of them that were murdered, and
their skulls, mangled with the teeth of wild beasts. Then she offers
sacrifices (their enchanted entrails lying panting), and sprinkles them
with divers kinds of liquors; sometimes with fountain water, sometimes
with cow's milk, sometimes with mountain honey, and mead. Then she ties
those hairs into knots, and lays them on the fire, with divers odors, to
be burnt. Then presently, with an irresistible power of magic, and blind
force of the gods, the bodies of those whose hairs did smoke, and crash,
did assume the spirit of a man, and feel, and hear, and walk, and come
whither the stink of their hair led them, and, instead of Bæotius, the
young man, come skipping and leaping with joy and love into the house.
Austin also reports that he heard of some women sorceresses, that were
so well versed in these kind of arts, that, by giving cheese to men,
they would presently turn them into working cattle and, the work being
done, restored them into men again.
