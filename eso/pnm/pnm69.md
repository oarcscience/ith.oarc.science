### CHAPTER LX.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of Madness, and Divinations which are made when men are awake, and of the Power of a Melancholy Humor, by which Spirits are sometimes induced into Men's Bodies</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> happens also, sometimes, that not only
they that are asleep, but also they that are watchful, do, with a kind
of instigation of mind, divine; which divination Aristotle calls
ravishment, or a kind of madness, and teacheth that it proceeds from a
melancholy humor, saying in his treaties of divination: Melancholy men,
by reason of their earnestness, do far better conjecture, and quickly
conceive a habit, and most easily receive an impression of the
celestials. And he, in his Problems, saith that the Sibyls, and the
Bacchides, and Niceratus the Syracusan, and Ammon, were, by their
natural melancholy complexion,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

prophets and poets. The cause, therefore, of this madness, if it be
anything within the body, is a melancholy humor; not that which they
call black choler, which is so obstinate and terrible a thing, that the
violence of it is said, by physicians and natural philosophers (besides
madness, which it doth induce), to draw or entice evil spirits to seize
upon men's bodies. Therefore, we understand a melancholy humor here, to
be a natural and white choler. For this, when it is stirred up, burns,
and stirs up a madness conducing to knowledge and divination, especially
if it be helped by any celestial influx, especially of Saturn, who
(seeing he is cold and dry, as is a melancholy humor, hath his influence
upon it) increaseth and preserveth it. Besides, seeing he is the author
of secret contemplation, and estranged from all public affairs, and the
highest of all the planets, he doth, as he withcalls his mind from
outward business, so also make it ascend higher, and bestows upon men
the knowledge and presages of future things. And this is Aristotle's
meaning, in his book of Problems. By melancholy, saith he, some men are
made, as it were, divine, foretelling things to come; and some men are
made poets. He saith, also, that all men that were excellent in any
science, were, for the most part, melancholy. Democritus and Plato
attest the same, saying that there were some melancholy men that had
such excellent wits that they were thought and seemed to be more divine
than human. So also there have been many melancholy men at first rude,
ignorant and untractable, as they say Tynnichus, Hesiod, Ion,
Calcinenses, Homer, and Lucretius were, who on a sudden were taken with
a madness and became poets, and prophesied wonderful and divine things,
which they themselves scarce understood. Whence Plato, in Ion, saith
that many prophets, after the violence of their madness was abated, do
not well understand what they

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

wrote, yet treated accurately of each art in their madness; as all
artists, by reading of them, judge. So great also, they say, the power
of melancholy is of, that, by its force, celestial spirits also are
sometimes drawn into men's bodies, by whose presence and instinct,
antiquity testifies, men have been made drunk and spake most wonderful
things. And this thing, they think, happens under a three-fold
difference, according to a three-fold apprehension of the soul, viz.,
imaginative, rational, and mental; they say, therefore, that when the
mind is forced with a melancholy humor, nothing moderating the power of
the body, and, passing beyond the bounds of the members, is wholly
carried into imagination, it doth suddenly become a seat for inferior
spirits, by which the mind oftentimes receives wonderful ways and forms
of manual arts. So we see that any most ignorant man doth presently
become an excellent painter, or contriver of building, and to become a
master in any such art. But when these kinds of spirits portend to us
future things they show those things which belong to the disturbing of
the Elements and changes of times, as rain, tempests, inundations,
earthquakes, slaughter, great mortality, famine, and the like. As we
read in Aulus Gelius that his priest, Cornelius Patrarus, did, at the
time when Cæsar and Pompey were to fight in Thessalia, being taken with
a madness, foretell the time, order and issue of the battle. But when
the mind is turned wholly into reason it becomes a receptacle for middle
world spirits. Hence it obtains the knowledge and understanding of
natural and human things. So we see that a man sometimes doth on a
sudden become a philosopher, physician, or an orator, and foretells
mutations of kingdoms, and restitutions of ages, and such things as
belong to them, as did the Sibyl to the Romans. But when the mind is
wholly elevated into the understanding, then it becomes a receptacle of
sublime

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

spirits and learns of them the secrets of divine things, such as the Law
of God, and the Orders of Angels, and such things as belong to the
knowledge of things eternal and the ascent of souls. It foresees things
which are appointed by predestination, such as future prodigies or
miracles, the prophet to come, and the changing of the law. So the
Sibyls prophesied of Christ a long time before his coming. So Virgil,
understanding that Christ was at hand and remembering what the Sibyl,
Cumæa, had said, sang thus to Pollio:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Last times are come, Cumæa's prophesie—  
Now from high heaven springs a new progenie,  
And times Great Order now again is born,  
The Maid returns, Saturnian Realms return.</span>

</div>

And, a little after, intimating that original sin shall be of no effect,
he saith:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">If any prints of our old vice remain’d  
By thee they're void, and fear shall leave the Land;  
He a God's life shall take, with Gods shall see  
Mixt Heroes, and himself their object be;  
Rule with paternal power th’ appeased Earth  
He shall——</span>

</div>

Then he adds, that thence the fall of the Serpent, and the poison of the
tree of death, or of the knowledge of good and evil, shall be nulled,
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">——The Serpent shall  
And the deceitful Herb of Venom fall.</span>

</div>

Yet he intimates that some sparks of original sin shall remain, when he
saith:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Some steps of ancient fraud shall yet be
found.</span>

</div>

And at last with a most great hyperbole cries out to his child, as the
offspring of God, adoring him in these words:

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Dear race of Gods, great stock of Jupiter,  
Behold! the World shakes on its ponderous axe,  
See earth, and heavens immense, and Ocean tracts,  
How all things at th’ approaching Age rejoice!  
O, that my life would last so long, and voice,  
As would suffice thy actions to rehearse.</span>

</div>

There are also some prognostics which are in the middle, betwixt natural
and supernatural divination, as in those who are near to death, and,
being weakened with old age, do sometimes foresee things to come,
because, as saith Plato, by how much the more men are less hindered by
their sense, so much the more accurately they understand, and because
they are nearer to the place whither they must go (and their bonds
being, as it were, a little loosed, seeing they are no more subject to
the body) easily perceive the light of divine revelation.
