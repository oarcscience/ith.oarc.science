### SYMBOLS OF THE ALCHEMISTS.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> volume would be incomplete without
the symbols of the Alchemists, as they naturally pertain to Natural
Magic, and occasionally prove of great value. The London Pharmaceutical
Journal, an excellent authority, gives the symbols we here introduce.

Nowadays chemists write their formulas and work out their processes by
means of symbols, and the alchemists used also signs and hieroglyphics
to represent the then known elements, metals, and other substances in
common use.

The so-called elements—Fire, Water, Air, Earth—were represented by
special symbols, here represented. The metals were supposed to be
influenced by the planets to a certain degree, and were represented by
the corresponding signs of the Zodiac. Various other articles also had
their symbols, which served as a means of shorthand at a period when
caligraphy was little known or employed. Gold, for instance, was
associated with the Sun because of its brightness and perfection, for it
was always held to be the noblest of metals. The symbol applied to it
embodies these qualities. Silver resembles the Moon in lustre, and the
origin of the crescent needs no explanation. Iron was dedicated to Mars,
being the metal from which implements of war were made, Mars being the
god of war, probably owing to the blood-red color of the planet. Saturn
was the slowest of the planets, and lead, being the dullest and most
despised of metals, was therefore accorded to Saturn. Quicksilver was,
of course, most appropriate to Mercury, the messenger of the gods.

Dr. Pereira derives all these symbols from gold and the Greek cross,
taken to represent acrimony the supposititious substance, which,
combined with gold, produced other metals. Copper, for instance, has the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

sign of gold on top, and that of acrimony underneath. Quicksilver
derived its symbol from that of silver on the top, because of its color,
that of acrimony beneath, and gold between, because gold was supposed to
lurk in all metals. Iron was supposed to contain acrimony of a different
nature from that of the other metals, being represented in this symbol
by the barbed spearhead. Fire and Water being antagonistic are
represented by the same symbol, one being inverted. Air, which was
supposed to be a modification of fire, has a modified fire symbol,
whilst the fourth hypothetical element has for its symbol that of air
inverted. These are based on Aristotle's doctrine, which taught that the
four elements had each two qualities, one of which was common to some
other elements.
