### SUBLIME OCCULT PHILOSOPHY.

<span class="smallcaps">Judicious Reader</span>: This is true and
sublime Occult Philosophy. To understand the mysterious influences of
the intellectual world upon the celestial, and of both upon the
terrestrial; and to know how to dispose and fit ourselves so as to be
capable of receiving the superior operations of these worlds, whereby we
may be enabled to operate wonderful things by a natural power—to
discover the secret counsels of men, to increase riches, to overcome
enemies, to procure the favor of men, to expel diseases, to preserve
health, to prolong life, to renew youth, to foretell future events, to
see and know things done many miles off, and such like as these. These
things may seem incredible, yet read but the ensuing treatise and thou
shalt see the possibility confirmed both by reason and example.
