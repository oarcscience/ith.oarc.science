### CHAPTER XXIX.

#### <span class="smallcaps">What Things Are Under the Power of Mercury, and Are Called Mercurial</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Things</span> under Mercury are these: Amongst
Elements, water, though it moves all things indistinctly. Amongst
humors, those especially which are mixed, as also the animal spirit.
Amongst tastes, those that are various, strange, and mixed. Amongst
metals, quick-silver, tin, and the silver marcasite. Amongst stones, the
emerald, achate or agate, red marble, and topaz, and those which are of
divers colors and various

figures naturally; and those that are artificial, as glass; and those
which have a color mixed with green and yellow. Amongst plants and
trees, the hazel, five-leaved grass, the herb mercury, fumitory,
pimpernel, marjoram, parsley, and such as have shorter and less leaves,
being compounded of mixed natures and divers colors. Animals, also, that
are of quick sense, ingenious, strong, inconstant, and swift; and such
as become easily acquainted with men, as dogs, weasels, apes, foxes, the
hart and mule; and all animals that are of both sexes, and those which
can change their sex, as the hare, civet cat, and such like. Amongst
birds, those which are naturally witty, melodious and inconstant, as the
linnet, nightingale, blackbird, lark, thrush, the gnat-snapper, the bird
calandra, the parrot, the pie, the bird ibis, the bird porphyrio, the
black beetle with one horn, and the sea-bird trochilus, which goes into
the crocodile's mouth for its food. Amongst fishes, the fish called
pour-contrel, for deceitfulness and changeableness; the fork-fish for
its industry, and the mullet, also, that shakes off the bait on the hook
with his tail.
