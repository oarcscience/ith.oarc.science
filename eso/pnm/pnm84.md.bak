### HENRY MORLEY'S CRITICISM.

<span class="smallcaps">Little</span> disguised by Hebrew admixture, and
little [pervaded](errata.htm#6.md) by the speculations of the Platonists of
Alexandria, Philo the Jew, Plotinus, and Iamblichus, whom the young
student quotes most frequently, we have again the Attic Moses, Plato,
speaking through a young and strong heart to the world. Very great was
the influence of Plato in this period of wakening to thought. Nothing
was known by experience of Nature, for little had been learnt since the
time when Plato, theorising upon Nature, owned it to be impossible to
arrive at any certain result in our speculations upon the creation of
the visible universe and its authors; "wherefore," he said, "even if we
should only advance reasons not less probable than those of others, you
should still be content." In this spirit alone Cornelius Agrippa taught
his age: "There are these marvels well accredited; there is this
cumbrous and disjointed mass of earthly, sensible experience, which
there is no way of explaining left to me but one. I accept the marvels,
foolish as they seem; they are as well accredited as things more
obviously true. With God all things are possible. In God all things
consist. I will adopt Plato's belief, that the world is animated by a
moving soul, and from the soul of the world I will look up to its
Creator. I cannot rest content with a confused mass of evidence; I will
animate with my own soul, and a faith in its divine origin, the world
about me. I will adopt the glorious belief of Plato, that we sit here as
in a cavern with our faces held from looking to the cavern's mouth, down
which a light is streaming and pours in a flood over our heads, broken

by shadows of things moving in the world above. We see the shadows on
the wall, hear echoes, and believe in all as the one known truth of
substance and of voice, although these are but the images of the
superiors. I also will endeavor to climb up out of the cave into the
land flooded with sunlight. I connect all that we see here with Plato's
doctrine of superior ideas, I subdue matter to spirit, I will see true
knowledge in apparent foolishness, and connect the meanest clod with its
divine Creator. I will seek to draw down influences, and to fill my soul
with a new strength imparted by the virtue of ideas streaming from
above. The superior manifest in the inferior is the law of Nature
manifested in the thing created. My soul is not sufficient for itself;
beyond it and above it lie eternal laws, subtle, not having substance or
form, yet the cause of form and substance. I cannot hope to know them
otherwise than as ideas; to unborn generations they will be revealed,
perhaps; to me they are ideas, celestial influences, working
intelligences. I believe in them, and I desire to lay open my soul to
their more perfect apprehension. They are not God, though God created
them; they are not man, though they have by divine ordainment formed
him. The more I dwell upon their qualities, the more I long for the
divine, the more shall I be blessed by the reception of their rays. The
more intensely I yearn heavenward, the more shall I bring down heaven to
dwell in my soul."

So we may hear, if we will, the spirit of the young inquirer pleading to
us from across the centuries, and if our own minds ever yearned for an
escape from the delusions of the grosser sense and the restriction set
by crowds on free inquiry, there is no true heart that will not say:
"You labored well, my brother."
