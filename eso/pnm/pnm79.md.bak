### CHAPTER LXX.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Virtue of Proper Names</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> the proper names of things are very
necessary in Magical Operations, almost all men testify. For the natural
power of things proceeds, first, from the objects to the senses, and
then from these to the imagination, and from this to the mind, in which
it is first conceived, and then is expressed by voices and words. The
Platonists, therefore, say that in this very voice, or word, or name
framed, with its articles, that the power of the thing, as it were some
kind of life, lies under the form of the signification. First conceived
in the mind, as it were through certain seeds of things, then by voices
or words, as a birth brought forth; and lastly, kept in writings. Hence
magicians say, that the proper names of things are certain rays of
things, everywhere present at all times, keeping the power of things, as
the essence of the thing signified, rules, and is discerned in them and
know the things by them, as by proper and living images. For, as the
great operator doth provide divers species and particular things by the
influence of the Heavens, and by the elements, together with the virtues
of planets, so, according to the properties of the influences, proper
names result to things and are put upon them by him who numbers the
multitude of the stars, calling them all by their names; of which names
Christ in another place speaks, saying, "Your names are written in
Heaven." Adam, therefore, that gave the first names to things, knowing
the influences of the Heavens and properties of all things, gave them
all names according to their natures, as it is written in Genesis, where
God brought all things that he had created before Adam, that he should
name them; and as he named any thing, so the name of it was; which
names,

indeed, contain in them wonderful powers of the things signified. Every
voice, therefore, that is significative, first of all signifies by the
influence of the celestial harmony; secondly, by the imposition of man,
although oftentimes otherwise by this than by that. But when both
significations meet in any voice or name, which are put upon them by the
said harmony, or men, then that name is with a double virtue, viz.,
natural and arbitrary, made most efficacious to act as often as it shall
be uttered in due place and time, and seriously, with an intention
exercised upon the matter rightly disposed, and that can naturally be
acted upon by it. So we read in Philostratus, that when a maid at Rome
died the same day she was married, and was presented to Apollonius, he
accurately inquired into her name, which being known, he pronounced some
occult thing, by which she revived. It was an observation amongst the
Romans, in their holy rites, that when they did besiege any city, they
did diligently enquire into the proper and true name of it, and the name
of that God under whose protection it was; which being known, they did
then with some verse call forth the Gods that were the protectors of
that city, and did curse the inhabitants of that city, so at length,
their Gods being absent, did overcome them, as Virgil sings:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">    —That kept this Realm, our Gods  
Their Altars have forsook, and blest abodes.</span>

</div>

Now the verse with which the Gods were called out and the enemies were
cursed, when the city was assaulted round about, let him that would know
find it out in Livy and Marcrobius; but also many of these Serenus
Samonicus, in his book of secret things, makes mention of.
