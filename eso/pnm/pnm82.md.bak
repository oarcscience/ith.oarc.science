### CHAPTER LXXIII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Virtue of Writing, and of Making Imprecations, and Inscriptions</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> use of words and speech is to express
the inwards of the mind, and from thence to draw forth the secrets of
the thoughts, and do declare the will of the speaker. Now, writing is
the last expression of the mind, and is the number of speech and voice,
as, also, the collection, state, end, continuing, and iteration, making
a habit, which is not perfected with the act of one's voice. And
whatsoever is in the mind, in voice, in word, in operation, and in
speech, the whole and all of this is in writing also. And as nothing
which is conceived in the mind is not expressed by voice, so nothing
which is expressed is not also written. And, therefore, magicians
command that in every work there be imprecations and inscriptions made,
by which the operator may, express his affection; that if he gather an
herb, or a stone, he declare for what use he doth it; if he make a
picture, he say and write to what end he maketh it, with imprecations
and inscriptions. Albertus, also, in his book, called the Speculum, doth
not disallow this, without

which all our works would never be brought into effect, seeing a
disposition does not cause an effect, but the act of the disposition. We
find, also, that the same kind of precepts was in use amongst the
ancients, as Virgil testifies when he sings:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">      I walk around  
First with these Threads—in number which three are—  
’Bout th’ Altars, thrice I shall thy Image bear.</span>

</div>

And a little after:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Knots, Amaryllis, tie! of Colors three,  
Then say, "These bonds I knit for Venus be."</span>

</div>

And in the same place:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">As with one fire this clay doth harder prove,  
The wax more soft; so, Daphnis, with our love.</span>

</div>
