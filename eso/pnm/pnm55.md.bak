### CHAPTER XLVI.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of Natural Alligations and Suspensions</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the Soul of the World by its virtue
doth make all things that are naturally generated or artificially made
to be fruitful, by infusing into them celestial properties for the
working of some wonderful effects, then things themselves—not only when
applied by suffumigations, or collyries, or ointments, or potions, or
any other such like way, but also when they, being conveniently wrapped
up, are bound to or hanged about the neck, or in any other way applied,
although by never so easy a contact—do impress their virtue upon us. By
these alligations, therefore, suspensions, wrappings up, applications,
and contacts, the accidents of the body and mind are changed into
sickness, health, boldness, fear, sadness, and joy, and the like. They
render them that carry them gracious or terrible, acceptable or
rejected, honored and beloved or hateful and abominable. Now these kind
of passions are conceived to be by the above said to be infused, and not
otherwise, like what is manifest in the grafting of trees, where the
vital virtue is sent and communicated from the trunk to the twig grafted
into it by way of contact and alligation. So in the female palm-tree,
when she comes near to the male her boughs bend to the male, and are
bowed, which, the gardeners seeing, bind ropes from the male to the
female, which becomes straight again, as if she had by this connection
of the rope received the virtue of the male. In like manner we see that
the cramp-fish, or torpedo, being touched afar off with a long pole,
doth presently stupefy the hand of him that toucheth it. And if any
shall touch the sea-hare with his hand or stick will presently run out
of his wits. Also, if the fish called stella, or star-fish, as they say,
being fastened with the blood of a fox

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

and a brass nail to a gate, evil medicines can do no hurt to any in such
house. Also, it is said, that if a woman take a needle and beray it with
dung, and then wrap it up in earth in which the carcass of a man was
buried, and shall carry it about her in a cloth which was used at the
funeral, that she shall be able to possess herself so long as she hath
it about her.

Now, by these examples, we see how, by certain alligations of certain
things, as also suspensions, or by a simple contact, or the connection
or continuation of any thread, we may be able to receive some virtues
thereby. It is necessary that we know the certain rule of Alligation and
Suspension, and the manner which the Art requires, viz., that they be
done under a certain and suitable Constellation, and that they be done
with wire, or *silken threads*, with hair, or sinews of certain animals.
And things that are to be wrapped up must be done in the leaves of
herbs, or the skins of animals, or *fine cloths*, and the like,
according to the suitableness of things—as, if you would procure the
Solary virtue of any thing, this being wrapped up in bay leaves, or the
skin of a lion, hang it about thy neck with a golden thread, or a silken
thread of a yellow color, whilst the Sun rules in the heaven—so thou
shalt be endued with the Solary virtue of that thing. But if thou dost
desire the virtue of any Saturnine thing, thou shalt in like manner take
that thing whilst Saturn rules, and wrap it in the skin of an ass, or in
a cloth used at a funeral (especially if you desire it for sadness), and
with a black thread hang it about thy neck. In like manner we must
conceive of the rest.
