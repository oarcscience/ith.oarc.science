### CHAPTER XLIII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of Perfumes or Suffumigations; Their Manner and Power</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Some</span> suffumigations, also, or perfumings,
that are proper to the Stars, are of great force for the opportune
receiving of celestial gifts under the rays of the Stars, in as much as
they do strongly work upon the air and breath. For our breath is very
much changed by such kind of vapors, if both vapors be of another like.
The air, also, being through the said vapors easily moved, or affected
with the qualities of inferiors or those celestial, daily; and, quickly
penetrating our breast and vitals, doth wonderfully reduce us to the
like qualities. Wherefore, suffumigations are wont to be used by them
that

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

are about to soothsay or predict for to affect their fancy or
conception; which suffumigations, indeed, being duly appropriated to any
certain deities, do fit us to receive divine inspiration. So they say
that fumes made with linseed, flea-bane seed, roots of violets, and
parsley, doth make one to foresee things to come and doth conduce to
prophesying. Let no man wonder how great things suffumigations can do in
the air, especially when he shall with Porphyrius consider that by
certain vapors, exhaling from proper suffumigations, airy spirits are
presently raised, as also thunderings and lightnings, and such like
things. As the liver of a chameleon, being burnt on top of the house,
doth, as is manifest, raise showers and lightnings. In like manner the
head and throat of the chameleon, if they be burnt with oaken wood,
cause storms and lightnings. There are also suffumigations under
opportune influences of the Stars that make the images of spirits
forthwith appear in the air or elsewhere. So, they say, that if of
coriander, smallage, henbane, and hemlock, be made a fume, that spirits
will presently come together; hence they are called spirit's herbs.
Also, it is said, that fume made of the root of the reedy herb sagapen,
with the juice of hemlock and henbane, and the herb tapsus barbatus, red
sanders, and black poppy, makes spirits and strange shapes appear; and
if smallage be added to them, the fume chaseth away spirits from any
place and destroys their visions. In like manner, a fume made of
calamint, peony, mints, and palma christi, drives away all evil spirits
and vain imaginations.

Moreover, it is said, that by certain fumes certain animals are gathered
together and also put to flight, as Pliny mentions concerning the stone
liparis, that with the fume thereof all beasts are called out. So the
bones in the upper part of the throat of a hart, being burnt, gather all
the serpents together; but

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

the horn of the hart, being burnt, doth with its fume chase them all
away. The same doth a fume of the feathers of peacocks. Also, the lungs
of an ass, being burnt, puts all poisonous things to flight; the fume of
the burnt hoof of a horse drives away mice; the same doth the hoof of a
mule; with which, also, if it be the hoof of the left foot, flies are
driven away. And, they say, if a house or any place be smoked with the
gall of a cuttle-fish, made into a confection with red storax, roses,
and lignum-aloes, or lignaloes, and if then there be some sea-water, or
blood, cast into that place, the whole house will seem to be full of
water or blood; and if some earth of plowed ground be cast there, the
earth will seem to quake. Now, such kinds of vapors, we must conceive,
do infect any body and infuse virtue into it, which Both continue long,
even as any contagious or poisonous vapor of the pestilence, being kept
for two years in the wall of a house infects the inhabitants, and as the
contagion of pestilence, or leprosy, lying hid in a garment, doth long
after infect him that wears it. Therefore, were certain suffumigations
used to affect images, rings, and such like instruments of magic and
hidden treasures, and, as Porphyrius saith, very effectually. So, they
say, if any one shall hide gold or silver, or any other precious thing,
the Moon being in conjunction with the Sun, and shall fume the hiding
place with coriander, saffron, henbane, smallage, and black poppy, of
each alike quantity, bruised together, and tempered with the juice of
hemlock, that which is so hid shall never be found or taken away; and
that spirits shall continually keep it, and if any one shall endeavor to
take it away he shall be hurt by them and shall fall into a frenzy.

And Hermes saith that there is nothing like the fume of spermaceti for
the raising of spirits. Wherefore, if a fume be made of that and
lignum-aloes,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

red storax, pepper-wort, musk, and saffron, all tempered together, with
the blood of a lapwing, it will quickly gather airy spirits together,
and if it be used about the graves of the dead, it gathers together
spirits and the ghosts of the dead.

So, as often as we direct any work to the Sun, we must make
suffumigations with Solary things, and if to the Moon, with Lunary
things, and so of the rest. And we must know that as there is a
contrariety and enmity in stars and spirits, so also in suffumigations
unto the same. So there is also a contrariety betwixt lignum aloes and
sulphur, frankincense, and quicksilver; therefore, spirits that are
raised by the fume of lignum aloes are allayed by the burning of
sulphur. As Proclus gives an example of a spirit, which was wont to
appear in the form of a lion, but, by the setting of a cock before it,
vanished away because there is a contrariety betwixt a cock and a lion,
and so the like consideration and practice is to be observed concerning
such like things.
