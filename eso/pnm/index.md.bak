<span class="small">They say, also, that the blood of a basilisk, which
they call the blood of Saturn, hath such great force in sorcery that it
procures for him that carries it about him good success of his petitions
from great men in power, and of his prayers from God, and also remedies
of diseases, and grant of any privilege.</span>

This is an early 20th century edition of Agrippa's Philosophy of Natural
Magic, along with a wealth of background material. Originally published
in 1531-3, De occulta philosophia libri tres, (Three books of Occult
Philosophy) proposed that magic existed, and it could be studied and
used by devout Christians, as it was derived from God, not the Devil.
Agrippa had a huge influence on Renaissance esoteric philosophers,
particularly Giordano Bruno.

While this is not a specialist edition, it will suffice for the casual
reader who doesn't want to wade through Elizabethan typography and
spelling, just enough of which is preserved here for flavor. A more
comprehensive transcription is located
[here](https://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/.md). This edition is a
pastiche of a portion of a translation of Agrippas' libri tres by an
unidentified translator, excerpts from a book on Agrippa by Henry Morley
with extensive background, and some self-promotional material by the
publisher, de Lawrence, who was a notorious pirate publisher. This end
material is of interest because it is a good example of early 20th
century American occult publishing.
