### CHAPTER XXXV.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Mixtions of Natural Things, One With Another, and Their Benefit</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is most evident that in the inferior
nature all the powers of superior bodies are not found comprehended in
any one thing, but are dispersed through many kinds of things amongst
us; as there are many Solary things, whereof every one doth not contain
all the virtues of the Sun; but some have some properties from the Sun,
and others other-some. Wherefore, it is sometimes necessary that there
be mixtions in operations, that if a hundred or a thousand virtues of
the Sun were dispersed through so many plants, animals, and the like, we
may gather all these together, and bring them into one form, in which we
shall see all the said virtues, being united, contained. Now, there is a
twofold virtue in commixtion; one, viz., which was first

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

planted in its parts, and is celestial; the other is obtained by a
certain and artificial mixtion of things, mixt amongst themselves, and
of the mixtions of them according to certain proportions, such as agree
with the heaven, under a certain constellation. And this virtue descends
by a certain likeness and aptness that is in things, amongst themselves,
towards their superiors, and just as much as the following things do by
degrees correspond with them that go before, where the patient is fitly
applied to its superior agent. So from a certain composition of herbs,
vapors, and such like, made according to the principles of natural
philosophy and astronomy, there results a certain common *form*, endowed
with many gifts of the Stars, as, in the honey of bees, that which is
gathered out of the juice of innumerable flowers and brought into one
form, contains the virtue of all, by a kind of divine and admirable art
of the bees. Yet this is not to be less wondered at, which Eudoxus
Giudius reports, of an artificial kind of honey which a certain Nation
of Giants in Lybia knew how to make out of flowers, and that very good
and not far inferior to that of the bees. For every mixtion, which
consists of many several things, is then most perfect when it is so
firmly compacted in all parts that it becomes one, is every where firm
to itself, and can hardly be dissipated—as we sometimes see stones and
divers bodies to be, by a certain natural power, so conglutinated and
united that they seem to be wholly one thing; as we see two trees, by
grafting, to become one; also oysters with stones, by a certain occult
virtue of Nature; and there have been seen some animals which have been
turned into stones, and so united with the substance of the stone that
they seem to make one body, and that also homogeneous; so the tree ebony
is one while wood and another while stone. When, therefore, any one
makes a mixtion of many matters

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

under the celestial influences, then the variety of celestial *actions*
on the one hand, and of natural *powers* on the other hand, being joined
together, doth indeed cause wonderful things—by ointments, by collyries,
by fumes, and such like—which are read of in the books of Chiramis,
Archyta, Democritus, and Hermes, who is named Alchorat, and many others.
