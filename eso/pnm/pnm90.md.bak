### THE NOBILITY OF WOMAN.

<span class="smallcaps">Angling</span> for private patronage was in the
sixteenth century correlative to the habit not very uncommon in these
days of using baits to catch the public favor. Men who once lived by the
help of princes now owe their support to the whole people, and the pains
bestowed upon the cultivation of the good-will of the people in these
days are neither less nor more to be reprehended than the pains taken by
scholars of past time to procure a safe means of subsistence through the
good-will of a prince. It may be said, with a fair approximation to the
truth, that as much as a man may do now, with the intention of deserving
popularity, and not discredit himself in his own eyes or those of the
great number of his neighbors, he might have done with as little
discredit in the sixteenth century with the design of earning favor from
the great. We have seen how, in the case of Reuchlin, a poor chorister
was fostered at first by small princes of Germany, afterwards even by
the emperor, and enabled to develop into a great Hebrew scholar, when
one patron died having another ready to befriend him, and enjoying
dignity and wealth with a complete sense of independence. That age was,
in fact, as far removed as this is from the transition period, during
which the patronage of letters by the great, extinct as a necessity,
survived as a tradition, and the system that had once been vigorous and
noble became imbecile and base.

Nobody at Dole was ignorant that the design of Cornelius Agrippa was to
earn the patronage of Margaret, a liberal encourager of learning. Nobody
considered it dishonorable to seek this by showing that it was deserved.
The prevalent feeling was so far removed from any such impression, that
from many quarters the young man was urged to magnify his claim on
Margaret's attention by devoting not only

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

the orations, but also some piece of writing to her honor. Even the
cordial vice-chancellor, desirous to advance the interests of the young
orator, set aside his predilection for the spoken word, and was among
the foremost in admonishing Cornelius to write. Not slow to profit by
advice that ran the same course with his inclinations, the new doctor of
divinity set himself to display his powers as a theologian in the true
manner of the day, and with theological acuteness to combine a
courtier's tact, by dedicating to the most conspicuous example of his
argument a treatise on the Nobility and Pre-excellence of the Female
Sex. As I have hinted, too, there was a private example of it known to
his own heart.

Angling for patronage shown from another point of view!—mean arts used
by mean spirits to compel the favor of the rich and base. But to secure
the favor of the rich and noble the arts used were not to be accounted
mean.

Now let us trace in a brief summary the argument for the Nobility of the
Female Sex and the Superiority of Woman over Man, written at Dole, in
the year 1509, by a doctor of divinity, aged twenty-three. He sets out
with the declaration that when man was created male and female,
difference was made in the flesh, not in the soul. He quotes Scripture
to show that after the corruption of our bodies difference of sex will
disappear, and that we shall all be like angels in the resurrection. As
to the soul, then, man and woman are alike; but as to everything else
the woman is the better part of the creation.

In the first place, woman being made better than man, received the
better name. Man was called Adam, which means Earth; woman Eva, which is
by interpretation Life. By as much as life excels earth woman therefore
excels man. And this, it is urged, must not be thought trivial
reasoning, because the

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

maker of those creatures knew what they were before he named them, and
was One who could not err in properly describing each. We know, and the
Roman laws testify, that ancient names were always consonant with the
things they represented, and names have been held always to be of great
moment by theologians and jurisconsults. It is written thus of Nabal:
"As his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him." (1
Samuel, xxv., 25.) Saint Paul, also, in his Epistle to the Hebrews,
speaks of his Lord and Master, as "made so much better than the angels,
as he hath obtained a more excellent name than they." (Heb., i., 4.) The
reader's memory will at once supply the next passage of Scripture
quoted, I do not like to cite it. Agrippa then dilates, as well he may,
on the immense importance of words, according to the practice of all
jurists, he tells how Cyprian argued against the Jews that Adam's name
was derived from the initials of the Greek words meaning east, west,
north, and south, because his flesh was made out of the earth, though
that derivation was at variance with Moses, who put only three letters
in the Hebrew name. For this, however, adds Agrippa, Cyprian was not to
blame, since, like many saints and expounders of the sacred text, he had
not learnt the Hebrew language.

Upon the word Eva it is further maintained that it suggests comparison
with the mystic symbols of the Cabalists, the name of the woman having
affinity with the ineffable Tetragrammaton, the most sacred name of the
Divinity; while that of the man differed entirely from it. All these
considerations, however, Agrippa consents to pass over, as matters read
by few and understood by fewer. The pre-eminence of the woman can be
proved out of her constitution, her gifts, and her merits.

The nature of woman is discussed, however, from the theologian's point
of view. Things were created

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

in the order of their rank. First, indeed, incorruptible soul, then
incorruptible matter, but afterwards, out of that matter, more or less
corruptible things, beginning with the meanest. First minerals, then
herbs, and shrubs, and trees, then zoophytes, then brutes in their
order, reptiles first, afterwards fishes, birds, quadrupeds. Lastly, two
human beings, but of these first the male, and finally the female, in
which the heavens and the earth and their whole adornment were
perfected. The divine rest followed, because the work was consummated,
nothing greater was conceived; the woman was thus left the most perfect
and the noblest of the creatures upon earth, as a queen placed in the
court that had been previously prepared for her. Rightly, therefore, do
all beings round about her pay to this queen homage of reverence and
love.

The difference between the woman and the man is yet more strongly
marked, says the deeply read theologian, because the man was made like
the brutes in open land outside the gates of paradise, and made wholly
of clay, but the woman was made afterwards in paradise itself; she was
the one [paradisiacal](errata.htm#8.md) creation. Presently there follow
Scripture arguments to show that the place of their birth was a sign to
men of honor or dishonor. The woman, too, was not made of clay, but from
an influx of celestial matter; since there went into her composition
nothing terrestrial except only one of Adam's ribs, and that was not
gross clay, but clay that had been already purified and kindled with the
breath of life.

The theological demonstrations Cornelius next confirms by the evidence
of some natural facts equally cogent and trustworthy, which were held in
that day by many wise men to be equally true. It is because she is made
of purer matter that a woman, from whatever height she may look down,
never turns .giddy, and her eyes never have mist before

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

them like the eyes of men. Moreover, if a woman and man tumble together
into water, far away from all external help, the woman floats long upon
the surface, but the man soon sinks to the bottom. Is there not also the
divine light shining through the body of the woman, by which she is made
often to seem a miracle of beauty Then follows a clever inventory of all
a woman's charms of person, written with due reserve, which might be
here translated, if the English language had the terseness of the Latin.
In short, woman is the sum of all earth's beauty, and it proved that her
beauty has sometimes inspired even angels and demons with a desperate
and fatal love. Then follows a chain of Scripture texts honoring female
beauty, which all lead up to the twenty thousand virgins, solemnly
celebrated by the church, and the admiration of the beauty of the Virgin
Mary by the Sun and Moon.

Texts follow that must be omitted, and then the argument takes
anatomical grounds of the most ingenious character, and shows how every
difference of structure between the man and the woman gives to woman the
advantage due to her superior delicacy. Even after death nature respects
her inherent modesty, for a drowned woman floats on her face, and a
drowned man upon his back. The noblest part of a human being is the
head; but the man's head is liable to baldness, woman is never seen
bald. The man's face is often made so filthy by a most odious beard, and
so covered with sordid hairs, that it is scarcely to be distinguished
from the face of a wild beast; in woman, on the other hand, the face
always remains pure and decent. For this reason women were, by the laws
of the twelve tables, forbidden to rub their cheeks lest hair should
grow and obscure their blushing modesty. But the most evident proof of
the innate purity of the female sex is, that a woman having once washed
is clean, and if she wash in

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

second water will not soil it; but that a man is never clean, though he
should wash in ten successive waters, he will cloud and infect them all.

Some other marvellous peculiarities I must omit, and pass to Agrippa's
appreciation of the woman's predominance in the possession of the gift
of speech, the most excellent of human faculties, which Hermes
Trismegistus thought equal to immortality in value, and Hesiod
pronounced the best of human treasures. Man, too, receives this gift
from woman, from his mother or his nurse; and it is a gift bestowed upon
woman herself with such liberality that the world has scarcely seen a
woman who was mute. Is it not fit that women should excel men in that
faculty, wherein men themselves chiefly excel the brutes?

The argument again becomes an edifice of Scripture text, and it is well
to show the nature of it. though we may shrink from the misuse of sacred
words, because it is well thoroughly to understand how Scripture was
habitually used by professed theologians in the sixteenth century, and
from this light example to derive a grave lesson, perhaps, that may be,
even to the people of the nineteenth century, not wholly useless.

Solomon's texts on the surpassing excellence of a good woman of course
are cited, and a cabalistic hint is given of the efficacy of the letter
H, which Abram took away from his wife Sarah, and put into the middle of
his own name, after he had been blessed through her. Benediction has
come always by woman, law by man. We have all sinned in Adam, not in
Eve; original sin we inherit only from the father of our race. The fruit
of the tree of knowledge was forbidden to man only, before woman was
made; woman received no injunction, she was created free. She was not
blamed, therefore, for eating, but for causing sin in her husband by
giving him to eat; and she did that not of her own will, but because the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

devil tempted her. He chose her as the object of temptation, as St.
Bernard says, because he saw with envy that she was the most perfect of
creatures. She erred in ignorance because she was deceived; the man
sinned knowingly. Therefore our Lord made atonement in the figure of the
sex that had sinned, and also for more complete humiliation came in the
form of a man, not that of a woman, which is nobler and sublimer. He
humbled himself as man, but overcame as a descendant of the woman; for
the seed of the woman, it was said, not the seed of man, should bruise
the serpent's head. He would not, therefore, be born of a man; woman
alone was judged worthy to be the earthly parent of the Deity. Risen
again, he appeared first to woman. Men forsook him, women never. No
persecution, heresy, or error in the Church ever began with the female
sex. They were men who betrayed, sold, bought, accused, condemned,
mocked, crucified the Lord. Peter denied him, his disciples left him.
Women were at the foot of the cross, women were at the sepulchre. Even
Pilate's wife, who was a heathen, made more effort to save Jesus than
any man among believers. Finally, do not almost all theologians assert
that the Church is maintained by the Virgin Mary?

Aristotle may say that of all animals the males are stronger and wiser
than the females, but St. Paul writes that weak things have been chosen
to confound the strong. Adam was sublimely endowed, but woman humbled
him; Samson was strong, but woman made him captive; Lot was chaste, but
woman seduced him; David was religious, but woman disturbed his piety;
Solomon was wise, but woman deceived him; Job was patient, and was
robbed by the devil of fortune and family; ulcerated, grieved,
oppressed, nothing provoked him to anger till a woman did it, therein
proving herself stronger than the devil. Peter was fervent in faith, but
woman forced

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

him to deny his lord. Somebody may remark that all these illustrations
tend to woman's shame; not to her glory. Woman, however, may reply to
man as Innocent III. wrote to some cardinal, "If one of us is to be
confounded, I prefer that it be you." Civil law allows a woman to
consult her own gain to an-other's hurt; and does not Scripture itself
often extol and bless the evil deeds of the woman more than the good
deeds of the man? Is not Rachel praised who deceived her fathers
Rebecca, because she obtained fraudulently Jacob's benediction? Is not
the deceit of Rahab imputed to her as justice? Was not Jael blessed
among women for a treacherous and cruel deed? What could be more
iniquitous than the counsel of Judith? what more cruel than her wiles?
what worse than her perfidy? Yet for this she is blessed, lauded, and
extolled in Scripture, and the woman's iniquity is reputed better than
the goodness of the man. Was not Cain's a good work when he offered his
best fruits in sacrifice and was reproved for it? Did not Esau well when
he hunted to get venison for his old father, and in the meantime was
defrauded of his birthright, and incurred the divine hate? Other
examples are adduced, and robust scholars, ingenious theologians, are
defied to find an equal amount of evidence in support of the contrary
thesis, that the iniquity of the man is better than the goodness of the
woman. Such a thesis, says Agrippa, could not be defended.

From this point to the end Agrippa's treatise consists of a mass of
illustrations from profane and Scripture history, classified roughly.
Some are from natural history. The queen of all birds, he says, is the
eagle, always of the female sex, for no male eagles have been found. The
phœnix is a female always. On the other hand, the most pestilent of
serpents, called the basilisk, exists only as a male; it is impossible
for it to hatch a female.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

All evil things began with men, and few or none with woman. We die in
the seed of Adam and live in the seed of Eve. The beginning of envy, the
first homicide, the first parricide, the first despair of divine mercy
was with man; Lamech was the first bigamist, Noah was the first
drunkard, Nimrod the first tyrant, and so forth. Men were the first to
league themselves with demons and discover profane hearts. Men have been
incontinent, and had, in innumerable instances, to each man many wives
at once; but women have been continent, each content with a single
husband, except only Bathsheba. Many women are then cited as
illustrations of their sex in this respect, or for their filial piety,
including Abigail, Lucretia, Cato's wife, and the mother of the Gracchi,
the vestal Claudia, Iphigenia. If any one opposes to such women the
wives of Zoilus, Samson, Jason, Deiphobus, and Agamemnon, it may be
answered that these have been unjustly accused, that no good man ever
had a bad wife. Only bad husbands get bad wives, or if they get a good
one, are sometimes able to corrupt her excellence. If women made the
laws, and wrote the histories and tragedies, could they not justly crowd
them with testimony to the wickedness of men? Our prisons are full of
men, and slain men cumber the earth everywhere, but women are the
beginners of all liberal arts, of virtue and beneficence. Therefore the
arts and virtues commonly have feminine names. Even the corners of the
world receive their names from women—the nymph Asia; Europe, the
daughter of Agenior; Lybia, the daughter of Epaphus, who is called also
Aphrica.

Illustrations follow of the pre-eminence of woman in good gifts, and it
is urged that Abraham, who by his faith was accounted just, was placed
in subjection to Sarah his wife, and was told, "In all that Sarah hath
said unto thee, harken unto her voice." (Gen., xxi., 12.)

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

There follows a host of other illustrations of the excellence of women,
drawn from all sources; among others, illustrations of her eminence in
learning. "And," adds Agrippa, "were not women now forbidden to be
literary, we should at this day have most celebrated women, whose wit
would surpass that of men. What is to be said upon this head, what even
by nature women seem to be born easily superior to practiced students in
all faculties? Do not the grammarians entitle themselves masters of
right speaking? Yet we learn this far better from our nurses and our
mothers than from the grammarians. For that reason Plato and Quintilian
so solicitously urged a careful choice of children's nurses, that the
children's language might be formed on the best model. Are not the poets
in the invention of their whims and fables, the dialecticians in their
contentious garrulity, surpassed by women? Was ever orator so good or so
successful, that a courtesan could not excel his powers of persuasion?
What arithmetician by false calculation would know how to cheat a woman
in the payment of a debt? What musician equals her in song and in
amenity of voice 3 Are not philosophers, mathematicians, and astrologers
often inferior to country women in their divinations and predictions,
and does not the old nurse very often beat the doctor?" Socrates
himself, the wisest of men, did not disdain to receive knowledge from
Aspasia, nor did Apollo the theologian despise the teaching of
Priscilla.

Then follows a fresh string of illustrations by which we are brought to
a contemplation of the necessity of women for the perpetuation of any
state, and the cessation of the human race that may be consequent on her
withdrawal. Through more examples we are brought then to consider the
honor and precedence accorded by law and usage to the female sex. Man
makes way for woman on the public road, and

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

yields to her in society the highest places. Purple and fine linen, gold
and jewels are conceded as the fit adornments of her noble person, and
from the sumptuary laws of the later emperors women were excepted.
Illustrations follow of the dignity and privileges of the wife, and of
the immunities accorded to her by the law. Reference is made to ancient
writers, who tell how, among the Getulians, the Bactrians, and others,
men were the softer sex, and sat at home while women labored in the
fields, built houses, transacted business, rode abroad, and went out to
do battle. Among the Cantabrians men brought dowries to their wives,
brothers were given in marriage by their sisters, and the daughters of a
household were the heirs. Among the Scythians, Thracians, and Gauls,
women possessed their rights, but among us, said Agrippa, "the tyranny
of men prevailing over divine right and the laws of nature, slays by law
the liberty of woman, abolishes it by use and custom, extinguishes it by
education. For the woman, as soon as she is born, is from her earliest
years detained at home in idleness, and as if destitute of capacity for
higher occupations, is permitted to conceive of nothing beyond needle
and thread. Then when she has attained years of puberty she is delivered
over to the jealous empire of a man, or shut up for ever in a shop of
vestals. The law also forbids her to fill public offices. No prudence
entitles her to plead in open court." A list follows of the chief
disabilities of women, "who are treated by the men as conquered by the
conquerors, not by any divine necessity, for any reason, but according
to custom, education, fortune, and the tyrant's opportunity."

A few leading objections are then answered. Eve was indeed made subject
to man after the fall, but that curse was removed when man was saved.
Paul says that "wives are to be subject to their husbands,

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

and women to be silent in the church," but he spoke of temporal church
discipline, and did not utter a divine law, since "in Christ there is
neither male nor female, but a new creature." We are again reminded of
the text subjecting Abraham to Sarah, and the treatise closes then with
a short recapitulation of its heads. "We have shown," Agrippa says, "the
pre-eminence of the female sex by its name, its order and place of
creation, the material of which it was created, and the dignity that was
given to woman over man by God, then by religion, by nature, by human
laws, by various authority, by reason, and have demonstrated all this by
promiscuous examples. Yet we have not said so many things but that we
have left more still to be said, because I came to the writings of this
not moved by ambition, or for the sake of bringing myself praise, but
for the sake of duty and truth, lest, like a sacrilegious person, I
might seem, if I were silent, by an impious taciturnity (and as it were
a burying of my talent) to refuse the praises due to so devout a sex. So
that if any one more curious than I am should discover any argument
which he thinks requisite to be added to this work, let him expect to
have his position not contested by me, but attested, in as far as he is
able to carry on this good work of mine with his own genius and
learning. And that this work itself may not become too large a volume,
here let it end."

Such was the treatise written by Cornelius at Dole for the more perfect
propitiation of the Princess Margaret. Many years
[elapsed](errata.htm#9.md) before it was printed and presented to the
princess; doubtless, however, the youth read the manuscript to his
betrothed very soon after it was written. Towards the close of the year
a friend in Cologne wrote to Agrippa of the impatience of his parents
for their son's return, but at the close of November another friend in
Cologne, Theodoric, Bishop of Cyrene, asking as an especial

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

favor for his views upon judicial astrology so hotly opposed by Pico di
Mirandola, says that his expression on the subject had appeared to him
ambiguous when they conversed together. Probably he had then been
offering to the embrace of his parents not a son only, but a son and
daughter, for it is said to have been in the year 1509, when all was
honor for him in the present, all hope in the future, that Cornelius von
Nettesheim married Jane Louisa Tyssie, of Geneva, a maiden equal to him
in rank, remarkable for beauty, and yet more remarkable for her
aspirations and her worth. She entered with her whole soul into the
spirit of her husband's life, rejoiced in his ambition, and knew how to
hold high converse with his friends. The marriage was in every respect a
happy one; there was a world of gentleness and loving kindness in
Agrippa's heart. We shall have revelation of it as the narrative
proceeds. The tenderness of his nature mingles strangely, sadly, with
his restlessness, his self-reliance, and his pride,

So, full of hope and happiness, at the age of twenty-three, he took to
wife a maiden who could love him for his kindliness, and reverence him
for his power. He was no needy adventurer, but the son of a noble house,
who was beginning, as it seemed, the achievement of the highest honors.
He was surrounded by admirers, already a doctor of divinity, hereafter
to attain he knew not what. Fostered by Maximilian's daughter, what
might not his intellect achieve?

Poor youth, even in that year of hope the blight was already settling on
his life! While he was writing praise of womanhood at Dole to win the
smiles of Margaret, Catilinet, a Franciscan friar, who had been at the
adjacent town of Gray when Reuchlin was expounded, mediated cruel
vengeance on the down-chinned scholar. At Ghent, as preacher before the
Regent of the Netherlands and all her court,

those same days which were spent by the young student in pleasant effort
to deserve her kindness.

Now it was that Agrippa wrote his book on Magic.
