### CHAPTER XVIII.

#### SELF-DE-HYPNOTISATION.

In the foregoing papers, I have tried to enforce upon my readers the
indispensable necessity of shifting our point of view from the lower to
the higher planes of thought-life.

It may be with regard to our physical self or our intellectual self or
our emotional self;—we must view and manipulate them all from but one
standpoint—the plane of the Spirit. This is one of the most important
principles of Yoga. Yoga means Union. The human will trying to come into
the plane of the Divine Creative Principles practises Yoga. The Creative
thought in the Divine Spirit must of necessity exist in our minds. Then
why do we not act up to it? Why are not our efforts directed purely to
the working out of the great plan? Why, if we are really Divine, do we
grovel in the puppet-play of a false worldly life?

The answer is we have been thinking invertedly. We have been basing our
conclusions upon the suggestions of the sense-born intellect—the mind of
the Flesh. We have to pass from this standpoint to that of the
Spirit—God—the Absolute. We have to translate our highest conception of
our relation to the Spirit into conscious

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

values. The mere grasping of this relation would tend to their objective
manifestation in us, through us and for us. A great saint of India said
"the Summum bonum of Bodily existence is to realise in the human body
the Supreme Personality of God;" that realisation is the magnum Opus of
human existence and it is possible only when we transcend the Lower self
and develop a correct appreciation of the spirit of the Great Will.

Man never creates anything; but when he seems to do so what he has done
is this: He has specialised the Universal Energies under the directive
power of his illumined intelligence by giving certain suggestions to the
Universal Creative mind, which takes up the suggestions and moulds out
the form from the Universal substance. Thus knowingly or unknowingly we
are ever sending forth suggestions into the Creative Mind which at last
start up before our vision as objective realities. From this we conclude
that the Perfect thinker alone can create Perfect Forms; others must of
necessity fail in this task. Hence our object is to come into conscious
touch with the Perfect thought which gave the initial movement that
developed this Universe. To accomplish this means the reproduction of
the Perfect thought in ourselves. For the Universal tries to find
expression on the plane of the Particular. Indeed this is the motive
behind evolution, the development of individualised centres of
consciousness resting in perfect recognition of their relation to the
Absolute. Each

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

soul is the centre of consciousness; a ray of Divine Light shot into
matter; a reflection of the Divine Mind. These centres of consciousness
must develop the Cosmic consciousness.

What is Cosmic Consciousness? It is the actualization of the relation
which the part bears to the whole. The reader must not commit the
blunder of supposing God to be capable of being parcelled out into
parts. So we are not thinking of material things along lines of physical
observation, but of that which is behind matter—I mean spirit—which is
the Life that ensouls material forms and of which those fauns are simply
so many projections. Suppose we place two mirrors facing each other—a
large one and a small one. Suppose further that the word "Life" is
engraved on the former; then by the law of reflection the same word
shall appear in the latter. That illustrates the relation between the
human and the Divine minds. Another illustration given by a mental
scientist is that of a self-influencing dynamo where the magnetism
generates a current which intensifies the magnetism thus leading to the
generation of a still stronger current till at last the saturation point
is reached. Only between the human and the Divine minds there is no such
thing as saturation point, but the recognition of the latter by the
former simply renders the former a medium for the specialization of the
latter. Now suppose any illustration of the two mirrors, a quantity of
dust accumulates upon the small one. Then, necessarily, no reproduction
of the image on the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

large mirror can take place, in the small one. By evident analogy if the
human mind is clouded it cannot awaken unto a realization of the Divine
thought-image existing in the mind of the perfect thinker—God.

That is exactly our trouble. We are labouring under the hypnotic spell
of thoughts not in consonance with the true spiritual laws of the
Universe as well as our true self. This is the result of the inversion
of thought. We have been under the impression that from external
conditions we can develop inner stage of consciousness. This is the
master-spell which is an illusion or Maya. Our entire thought-life has
been rusting under the vitiating, poisoning effect of this idea. This is
the poison seed which has developed the mighty tree of Maya. To pluck it
out we must draw inwards and realise that inner states of consciousness
wield an evermoulding influence upon matter and hew out ever varying
forms, just as the image projected upon the specular screen of a magic
lantern is really determined by the slide in the lantern. Change the
slide images and you have other images on the screen. Change the thought
in your mind and you change the form materialised thereby. Influence the
lower self from this standpoint and your thought-life shall take on
newer, more beautiful forms—which in reality form the grand and noble
stuff composing the life of every highly evolved soul. The self has
de-hypnotised itself from the illusion of forms. It has found its place
in life—sees itself as the principle of life and is free and immortal.
