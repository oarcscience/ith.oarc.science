### CHAPTER II.

#### THE IDEAL AND THE PRACTICAL.

HERE are two words—IMAGINATION and FANCY. What is the distinction
between the two? Well, the one is closely related to the positive and
the conscious side of our character; the other can claim kinship with
the negative and the receptive side only. Take a youth starting in life.
He has not been born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He is poor and
has absolutely none to look to for help of any sort whatsoever.

Now, suppose *he has spirit*, and instead of sitting down and bewailing
his lot, he forms a definite plan of conduct, throws his mind forward
into the future, and decides to reach a certain state of development. He
pictures to himself that state in its perfection, plans out the methods
whereby he is to achieve it, takes in the difficulties to be met with
and conquered, and by an effort of common sense reasoning sees the
actual amount of good accruing to humanity and to all of God's creatures
in general. He has had to think hard in order to construct the whole
picture. He has had to breathe life upon it by repeating the images in
connection with the whole picture. He has had to acquire knowledge, seek
the advice of men more experienced than himself,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

and all the while he has had to keep up a brave and hopeful attitude of
mind. And, mark you, he scorns to think of failure. It is for him to try
his level best. It is for nature, which is a hard though a just
pay-mistress, to bring him his reward in its due season.

The above is a fair example of the exercise of *Imagination*.

Fancy plays us tricks. It is not the man who pulls the strings this
time. He simply yields himself to the influence of all sorts of
impossible day-dreams. His mind is a sieve for thoughts to pass in and
out. It is an aimless, idle, wandering, and brings ready victims for the
"pitch-and-toss" game of men whose principle is to "*do*" others before
the latter can have a turn at them.

A man is what his ideals are. If one man with an ideal makes fifty
mistakes in a day, the man without an ideal is sure to commit many more.
This is a simple truth, yet it will bear repetition here. All muscular
actions, whether mental or physical, are simply fragments from the
ideal.

"The life of the ideal is in the practical; it is the ideal that has
penetrated the whole of our life, whether we philosophise or perform the
hard, everyday duties of life. . . . It is the ideal that has made us
what we are and will make us what we are to be. . . . The principle is
seldom expressed in the practical, yet the ideal is never lost sight
of"—("Pavhari Baba" by Vivekananda).

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The very fact of the ideal being present in your mind foreshadows its
fulfilment.

Our thoughts set up a magnetic centre within us. Like attracts like.
Good thoughts draw to themselves corresponding thoughts. This fact is
very emphatic. Each tree brings forth fruits of its kind. If we think
*well*, we cannot act *ill*. The greatness of a man must find its
measure in the greatness of his thoughts, and not in the amount of money
in his pocket or the bluster on his tongue.

Our ideal is the hinge upon which our future turns. We create our own
fate.

The first essential is to pitch our aims high. Let us look upward and
upward alone. Let us pray to God for strength by all means, but let us
be prepared to deserve His grace by walking a straight path.

If we weave our thoughts around a grand purpose in life the ideal so
formed may take material form any day. Its impulsion may stir up
concretions of gross physical matter into activity and may clap spurs to
the feet of even a lazy hack. So much for the ideal.

If the ideal is to be *cherished*, it must also be *nourished*. If you
simply sit down and desire to get a thing, you will never get it and it
is good for you that you should not. For the practical side of things
must never be neglected. "Practice makes perfect." Having set currents
of holy desire in motion, we must set to deepen them in intensity and
volume.

"*Great actions are only transformed great concentrations*."

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Desire expands the
will; action clinches it into strength. Each act in the right direction
goes to establish us in our ideal. Action gives us training. Education
is for self-discipline. Force of character is what we want; money, fame,
praise and blame may well take care of themselves.

What matters it what the world thinks of me so long as I can think well
of myself? Have I a clear conscience? Is my body under my control? Is my
mind pure? Do I love main? Do I dare to look others straight in the eye?
Do I fear anything?

The answer to such questions will go to make up the sum of our happiness
or misery.

A strong will; a steady pulse; a pure mind; these are what we want.

But nought comes from nought—*Ex nihilo nihil fit*. Nothing will drop
from the skies. See here, my brother, do you want a thing? Is it a good
thing? *Then take it*. Let us deserve what we desire. That is the
energetic way of setting about things.

Action, right action, unselfish action; these alone can give us
strength. *To think is to act. To act is to live. To live is to love*.
"Love, Love; that is the sole resource."

Therefore, O Thou Soul!, pray to thy primal source, God, for the power
to make others happy.

Disease may come; limb after limb may be lopped off; sorrow may strike
thee to the core; yet cease not to desire nobly, and to bear thyself in
action yet more nobly.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The privacy of your own room, aye, of your own mind is the place where
you must play the man.

We have long lived under the influence of fear—the firstborn of
Ignorance. Let knowledge come and with it its power—Courage.

This is the supreme lesson we have to learn—Fear leads us from death to
death; courage opens the gate into Life, Serenity, and Joy.
