*Yoga Lessons for Developing Spiritual Consciousness*, by A.P. Mukerji,
\[1911\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### INTRODUCTION

<span class="small">Verily, in whom unwisdom is destroyed by the wisdom
of the Self, in them, Wisdom, shining as the Sun, reveals the
Supreme.—<span class="smallcaps">Bhagavad Gita</span>.</span>

Yoga is a subject which has enthralled the attention of the world from
time out of mind. No one has hitherto done justice to such a grand
system though there have been, now and then, innumerable attempts.

The present author, my esteemed friend, Swami Mukerji, a Yogi who comes
out of a successive generation of Yogis, is a fit and proper instrument
to handle the subject. He, in these lessons prepares the layman for an
understanding of the Yoga and, through a series of wise and masterful
sayings, impresses on the mind of the reader the necessity for rising
above materialism, nay, solves the very problem "What am I?"

Every line is pregnant with mature thoughts and rivets one's attention,
and makes him think, think, think.

This is not a work for which an introduction, briefly setting forth the
contents, could be written.

I can but ask you to read, digest and improve.
