### CHAPTER XX.

#### CHARACTER-BUILDING.

Knowledge gives power. Power controls. Man stands for inner perfection.
Our character is the sum-total of our inner unfoldment. What is
unfoldment? I told you in my paper on Spiritual Unfoldment of the
different bodies of Man and how the right control and culture of each
body would enable the light of the Spirit to stream forth to the
objective plane of existence in all its pure radiance. Here is a
beautiful illustration. Take a small but strong, electric light bulb
wrapped around which are many pieces of cloth. Suppose further that the
electric light in the glass bulb is the Spirit shot into the Spiritual
Consciousness in and through which the Spirit can shine out without the
least obstruction and with a minimum of resistance. Remember the Light
is the spirit and the glass bulb is the thin veil of brilliant
mind—substance known as the spiritual mind. The piece of cloth
immediately next to the glass bulb is very fine and the light pierces it
through. The piece of cloth next to this one is a little less fine and
receives a little less of the light. Thus each piece of cloth as you go
lower and lower is less fine than the one immediately next above it till
at last you come to the

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

last piece. This cloth-piece is at once the thickest and the least
illumined of all others. You will see that whatever bit of light this
last one has is all it can possibly receive. Compared to this piece, the
last but one is brighter and more desirable and so on from the bottom
upwards. As you take off piece after piece, more and more light comes to
you and when you have stripped off the entire number of cloth-pieces you
have the pure electric light shining out of the transparent glass bulb.
Need I tell you how the last piece of cloth is the physical organism.
The grossest and least lighted-up sheath of man. The ego is mounting
upwards as it were, from the densest veil of matter to more and more
rarefied grades. The more rarefied the grade of matter in which you are
clothed the more highly energized and spiritualized it is. The finer
your body, the more powerfully vibrating the pranic force animating it.
Think over it in connection with the illustration of the tiny, strong,
electric light confined in the glass bulb and do not feel particularly
attached to your physical form.

#### CHARACTER—CONTROL.

Let us in this paper confine ourselves to (a) Habit-control, (b)
thought-control and (c) self-control.

I have already spoken to you, in full of thought-control in a preceding
paper. I advise you strongly to master and apply the principles laid
down in that lesson conjointly with what little I succeed in giving you

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

here, for truly, Habit and thought are the two great pillars of our
whole life-structure. They are the roots which sustain the tree of Life.
Poison the roots and you have set your plans for the rapid corrosion of
the royal tree; nourish and strengthen the roots and the tree shall
grow, develop and expand; it shall put forth leaves, flowers, branches,
and bear life-giving, sweet and nourishing fruits.

First of all let us consider Self-Control. What is it? How is this great
virtue to be acquired?

What is self-control?

Self-control in Yogis is demonstrated by perfect Soul-Calm. A perfect
Yogi will never allow himself to be cast into or hurried away by any
form of emotional disturbance and excitement. Indeed the mere idea is
absurd in connection with such developed souls. When they move through
the restless and busy throngs of men yielding every moment to some
emotional impulse; at times sad, at others glad, utterly unable to say a
firm, "No" to their impulses; unable to view things from any higher
point of view than that of the Relative and the transient form of
existence and getting miserable and falling into dejection at the least
touch of adverse conditions arising from the singularities of their
unillumined intellects;—on such occasions the self-controlled man will
remain unmoved in this atmosphere of conflicting thought-Magnetisms.
While all sorts of thought-waves are dashing against him his mental aura
remains untouched and unshaken, and he radiates peace. When

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

he sees distress and pain, he does not make the whole air throb with his
cries but he calmly sets about finding a remedy for the evil. When
something goes against his personality, he does not give way to a blind
rush of anger but he holds himself perfectly unruffled.

There was a great sage in India named Vyasa. His father, his grandfather
and his great-grandfather had all of them struggled for Perfection and
had fallen short of the mark.

Vyasa had himself striven for the same prize and failed. But as no
honest seeking goes unrewarded, at last a son was born to Vyasa who was
to manifest perfection in himself. Vyasa named him Suka. He taught him,
trained him and initiated him into the inner mysteries of the Spirit.
Suka was wonderfully intelligent. He soon grasped the principles of
spirit and embodied them in himself.

In those days there was a great philosopher-king named Janaka. He was
called "Videha"—bodiless, since he had lost all thought of body and
believed himself to be the spirit. Vyasa sent his son to this king's
court so that he might be put to test. Janaka being a developed
occultist came to know of this intuitively and made suitable
arrangements. When Suka arrived no notice was taken of him. The guards
gave him a seat but otherwise were quite oblivious of his presence. This
was no light matter. Vyasa was the most venerable sage in the country
and could dictate to any one. But Suka

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

was a Gnyani. For three days and nights he was left to himself. He sat
there calm and serene.

Then they conducted him into a splendid suite of rooms. All sorts of
luxuries, fragrant baths and regal honors were paid to him. Not a muscle
of his face moved. He was calm, serene and thoughtful. This continued
for eight days. Then he was led before the king who was sitting in full
court. Music was playing. You know the intoxicating influence of music
upon the brain. Beautiful girls and damsels, fit to bewitch the most
abstemious of men, were dancing and singing. In short, it was a most
impressive and splendid court. The king presented to Suka a cup of milk.
It was full to the brim. "Go seven times round the court but spill not a
drop of milk." Suka gravely bowed his head and accepted the cup. Round
and round the court he went. Thousands of pairs of eyes were levelled at
him. The music, dancing and nautch-girls of ravishing charm were all up
in arms against his concentrated attitude of calm and repose. But this
man went round, and after the seventh round returned the cup to the
king—full to the brim—with the same quiet expression. The King, the
court and everyone else could only gasp with surprise. This is the ideal
self-controlled man. Naught could distract his attention. Can you
conceive of a more positive proof of self-control? We shall do well to
bear this story in mind and, whatever be our position in life, our gaze
should ever be turned upwards and inwards. Never mind the form of
occupation. Always

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

maintain an inner balance and as soon as you are free, your attention
should fly back with intense longing to the Higher Life.

#### WHAT IS HABIT-CONTROL?

Habit or automatism compels all organized life. Habit is a
[rhythm](errata.htm#31.md) established by the Will. Now the former is
Static. It works along sub-conscious lines of mentation. If you lift the
brain-cap of man, you would see the belt of glowing and phosphorescent
brain-substance physiologically known as the [Corpus](errata.htm#32.md)
Callosum—this is the organic base of consciousness for the operation of
mental energy. The finer the matter, the greater, the more powerful its
vibrant force. This matter is constantly in motion, that is it ever
vibrates.

Habit is a mode of motion. It is the same pitch of vibration repeating
itself. The action of the Will is dynamic. When a man thinks
concentratedly for some length of time upon some resolve, deep vortices
are formed in the brain-substance. To these vortices the Will
communicates a certain wave—motion which continues till the force which
gave it the initial impulse exhausts itself. The stronger the will, the
greater the wave-length and the more lasting its action and the deeper
and more intensely active the vortices. You know how tenacious human
nature is of habits. It cannot but be so. Your thoughts create these
vortices. Your actions deepen them. Repeat the initiatory impulse and
the Law of automatism will take it up permanently

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

and keep up the motion. Your thoughts and actions register themselves in
your brain-cells and nerve-force. Each inward tension of the Will
develops changes in the molecular structure of the brain and since there
is an immediate rapport between the brain and the nervous system that
which exhausts or recuperates the "Volts" in that battery of vital
powers—the organized human brain—welds a corresponding influence upon
the vital centres of the body.

Professor Elmer Gates of Chevy Chase, the great American Experimenter in
the new science of Psycho-Physics, who has been conducting experiments
in an elaborate laboratory through complicated apparatus for measuring
the sensations and emotions of man is of the opinion—and this opinion is
endorsed by D. Carpenter in his grand work on Human Physiology and many
other leading investigators on the subject—that every conscious mental
activity creates in some part of the brain a definite chemical and
anatomical structure; that mind-activity creates organic structure; that
one essential condition of remembrance is the refunctioning of the
structure which was originally created by the conscious experience which
we remember; that organisms are mind-embodiments; that there is an art
of brain-building and mind-embodiment whereby individuals can get more
mind; that evil emotions create poisonous chemical products in the cells
and juices of the body; that there is an art of promoting originative
mentation, consciously and subconsciously; that immoral dispositions

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

can be cured by putting in the same parts of the brain where they have
evil-memory structures a far greater number of good structures, and then
keeping the good structures functionally active a greater number of
times daily than the evil ones; and that one's mental capacity can be
more than doubled. The self-activity of the mind creates organic
structures and, says Professor Gates:

"The mind rules the body. Here you have the grand principle of magnetic
affinity between brain-waves and health-conditions in a nut shell.
Psychologists give two divisions of the Habit-nature: the natural and
the artificial. The natural is the mode of motion kept up by the
Instinctive mind for the up-keep of health conditions. It is quite
well-educated. Do not disturb it by trying to take control of it. The
body has been abused and badgered by the artificial life of modern
civilization. Go back to nature; have full confidence in it and do not
meddle with the Involuntary activities of the body. As to artificial
habits, I will simply say that they arise from the singularities of the
ill-developed mind.

Remember this: All instinctive action is the continual and automatic
swing of motion at first initiated by the Will and later on established
on a permanent basis by continued repetition. This rhythm, if improperly
and unwisely initiated can be swung on to a new line or can be
disturbed. The will which started the motion can assuredly call it back
by starting an opposite set of vibrations, which are finer and more
powerful and bring about an equilibrium of forces and, by the further

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

sustenance of same, develop an entirely new condition. One can change
one's physical conditions as well as mental and emotional states by
suggesting to one's subconscious mind the desired transformation and by
constructing a mental picture, contemplating and projecting same into
the realms of subconsciousness. As James Allen puts it:

Mind is the master-power that moulds and makes, and man is mind and ever
more he takes.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The tool of thought and, shaping what he wills,  
Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills:  
He thinks in secret and it comes to pass;  
"Environment is but his looking-glass."  
We build our future, thought by thought,  
Or good or bad, and know it not  
Yet so the universe is wrought,  
Thought is another name for Fate  
Choose then thy destiny, and wait  
For Love brings Love, and Hate brings Hate—  
Again: All that we are is the result of thought.  
               Lord Buddha: "The [Dhammapada](errata.htm#33.md)."</span>

</div>

Now if you would control your habits, you must begin by forming Positive
Decisions and then act them out. For instance, if you want to correct
yourself of Fearfulness and Nervousness, sit quietly and repeat to
yourself in all earnestness, "I resolve to drive out of my brain all
fear thoughts. I will not permit them to come in. I am master. I am
Brave. I am perfectly fearless.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I resolve to be
full of Courage, Snap, and mental vigor. I am Master."

Repeat this to yourself earnestly, concentratedly and positively. Insist
upon immediate mastery. Say "I will conquer, this moment, this very
moment," and set up the Strong Present tense. This is a most important
fact to remember. When you sit down to concentrate, relax all over,
breathe deeply and gently, and let your mind dwell exclusively upon
these thoughts. Then gradually wind up your brain to a state of inner
tension. Do not contract your brows. Do not clench your fists. Do not
make any physical movement at all. Let the body rest in quiet repose.
Let the mind be alertly poised. Set the teeth together quietly for the
lock of the jaws is the seat of the will-force, but do not grind and
gnash them. Simply close your eyes and shut out of your mental vision
all the external world.

Retire into yourself mentally. Draw inwards. As the mind becomes tense,
the body naturally follows suit. But this is not right. You should
"break off" from time to time and then begin again. Soon the body shall
be taught to lie quiescent while the brain is intensely active.
Concentrate twice every day at the same hour. Soon the Law of
Periodicity will set in and lead you into your room for your
concentration exercise although you might have forgotten it. Be rigid in
these matters. When you have once begun, do not be overcome by initial
failures and your lapses into former states of mind. The new form of
vibrations must adjust

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

themselves along settled lines and you must persevere by right thoughts
and their determined execution into actions till then.

Do not make false promises to yourself. If you do so you will become a
miserable "dreamer" prostrated by mental weaknesses. Determine to do a
thing and do it. After you have made your resolve to banish evil
thoughts and crush a certain bad habit, turn your mind to
Oppositely-higher types of thought and habit and persist in your resolve
to be Master. Remember a resolve will last a certain length of time in
proportion to the force which generated it and then it must be renewed
repeatedly till it becomes clinched into a habit.

Hold firmly in your mind the particular thought which you would embody
in yourself, during the time you are nourishing your body and at least
an hour afterwards. This will liberate certain finer forces from the
food and nourish particular brain-centres that you are building up. Do
the same when walking in fresh air and when having physical exercise.
This will deepen the thought-channels in the brain. Remember, at first
there will be resistance from the lower brain-centres, but as the higher
centres develop they will take absolute control. Go on. Stop not; you
must build up a new brain in which the higher centres will control the
lower ones and this process of Brain-transformation has to be done. It
is very painful, but now that you know these things, and see the
absolute necessity of setting about the task, it is no use getting
impatient. The following lines from

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dr. Sheldon
Leavit, M. D., will help you immensely when practicing the above
exercises. It has a direct bearing upon the setting up of the strong
Present, I have already spoken of.

The present tense crystallizes possibilities. In "I am" and "It is" are
wrapped great possibilities. There is a wealth of satisfaction to be
found in being able to say, in all faith, "I am well, I am strong, I am
Happy." Assurance like this crystallizes into tangibility, the things
for which otherwise we are perpetually longing. It is a giant hand
reaching out into the future and bringing to our feet what has long
eluded us. Faith then proves a wonder-worker. It stands sponsor for us
under all the trying conditions of life. When desire rises within us for
some great good upon which to build a useful and happy life; the Present
tense of faith at once brings it within our grasp.

To effect our purpose we should not hesitate to avail ourselves of the
help to be had from any of the facilities at command. In a particular
emergency all we lack may be the inspiration which shall drive us to
triumph. Our greatest trouble arises from the tendency of the human
(lower) mind to dwell upon failure rather than Success. We lose
confidence in our ability to accomplish because we ourselves or some one
else has met with failure, and it becomes necessary to churn up all our
emotional energies to carry us past the sticking point. The best of us
are not using a tittle of the powers which we really possess. Compared
with what we ought to be,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

we are only half awake. It is right here that the power of assertion can
do effective work in the rousing of our dormant faculties and bringing
into strong action the forces awaiting our command. But they need
vigorous stirring.

A young physician had been lying ill for many weeks from what appeared
to be a serious complication of disorders, from which he had nearly
given up hope of recovering. All his powers of resistance were seemingly
in ruin. He could not sleep, he could not eat. He could not speak above
a low tone. To sit up was beyond his power; his vital forces were at so
low an ebb. His circulation was feeble and even his mind appeared to be
wavering. After a careful examination I pressed upon him the need of
summoning all his mental and physical powers, tottering to a final fall,
in a grand effort to throw off the terrible incubus, which was crushing
him as a strong man might crush his foe, by one vigorous and desperate
effort. It did not seem hard for him to believe, under the stimulation
that he would ultimately recover, but to bring his faith to immediate
acceptance of relief was the difficulty. But he resolved to do this and
warmly confessed his faith when at once the force of the ailment broke,
the life-forces were set into cheerful and strong action and he soon
resumed his place among men.

In reviewing the case I can see that it was that final culmination of
all his hopes, that concentration of all his mental and spiritual powers
into creative assertion,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

that lifted him out of the desperate condition into which he had sunk,
and from which he would probably have moved downwards on gradually
declining planes, to utter despair and death.

Before I close this chapter let me reiterate some important points. You
can control your habits, however perverse they may appear. A complete
decision of the mind is the first step. Effort, yea, Positive Effort and
an indomitable will is the second thing. Remain unshaken in your
resolves. Remember the first twenty-five years of every man constitute
the Formative Period of life. The habits that you carry with yourself
across this age become persistent and die hard. The psychological
explanation is simple. During adult age growth is very rapid and your
brain-channels are strongly grooved out; but this should not lead you to
despair. You can render your brain responsive and pliant by earnest
endeavor at any period of life, only those who take to these things in
their youth will find the task of habit-culture comparatively easier.
But it matters not at all whether you are young, middle-aged or old. You
must do these things, not because of any extraneous pressure—you who
have followed me so far cannot and should not believe in any such
thing—but because it is the law of your nature.

At first when you start forming a new habit, there is resistance from
your brain and many heroic efforts are necessary. Then gradually the
task shall become easy and really pleasant. Another important fact to
remember is that if at some hour today you go into your

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

room and send forth an intense thought, next day the same thought shall
start up in your mind at the same point of time. This is known as
Periodicity. Therefore supposing you want to perform some difficult task
with which your mind is not accustomed to cope, Sit up a few hours
previous to that time and suggest to yourself, "I wish you, subjective
mind, to prepare yourself for the performance of such and such a task
tomorrow at 4 o'clock. Be sure you do it. Now prepare yourself." Next
day you will find yourself quite prepared to accomplish the task.
Suppose you wanted to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning. Before
retiring to bed say to yourself on your subjective mind "Look here—I
wish you to get up (or wake me up) at 4 o'clock. Be sure you do it." You
will wake at that hour..

Always concentrate your attention upon such autosuggestions and repeat
them till you feel sure your commands will be obeyed and they will be,
if you insist upon their fulfilment positively and persistently with
confidence. Believe in your power to succeed and everything in nature
shall rush to your aid.

#### CONCLUSION.

Dear Student: Before we part let me thank you for having paid attention
to what I have said thus far. This work is meant solely to extend to you
a helping hand in the thickening gloom of Materialism which I see with
horror and pain all around me. Whatever I have tried to tell you has
received a trial at my own hands

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

and may it strike a sympathetic chord in your heart. It may be my good
fortune to present to you more fully some truths of the Grand Yoga
Philosophy of ancient India of which I have hardly succeeded in touching
even the outskirts. You may catch a passing glimpse here, a flash of
light there:—but what of that? The Lord alone can enlighten your
intellect. Therefore meditate and pray often and wait in patient
earnestness for the dawn of spiritual Light from within. It will come.
You cannot escape your own birth right.

Peace—Peace—Peace—be unto You.
