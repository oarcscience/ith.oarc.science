### CHAPTER III.

#### READ AND REFLECT.

"WHATEVER is worth doing is worth doing well;"—an age-worn saying but
one which cannot be rung too often on human ears. We are mostly
selfish—and all blame to us!—and this because the Light of the Lord
within us is so bedimmed by the darkness of the lower nature.

Our deeds are accomplished best when we put heart in them; when we see
some gain accruing to us. Need I prove this?

What is the Central pivot we turn upon? Attraction;—and its opposite,
Repulsion. We take an interest in certain things. The former gives us a
touch of pleasure, the latter causes pain. Both act diametrically; and
the will, unable to assert itself, is unable to draw to itself the
happiness-giving objects. Pain racks the soul.

*The aim of philosophy is to put an end to pain*. It does not bring down
upon us the gloom of despair, but the sunshine of Cheerfulness. Applying
this to our actions we see how philosophy, in the *positive* sense, is a
true helper. It hands us a *weapon* which cuts through difficulties. The
weapon is *Wisdom*.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

By Wisdom I mean a light which is *self-luminous*. Man has an *infinite*
field of Consciousness. This sphere, as it widens out, realises for us
all that we want *rightly*. Our actions become linked together
symmetrically and at the end of the chain of wise activity is the
*desired* object.

It is hence wise to acquire wisdom. How to do it? *By unfolding the
consciousness*. How to unfold? Well, there are many methods, most
difficult; but I am going to give you a very easy one, applying which,
success is as sure as that morning follows night.

In the ordinary course of things we walk at a snail's pace, and progress
is woefully slow. But we can *quicken* the pace and climb swiftly by
taking ourselves in hand, *by training the mind*.

The mind is a queer storehouse. The school-boy bakes his brain on a dry
course of lessons daily. Why? To train the mind. That is education:
Controlling the well-nigh uncontrollable: the ever-moving,
ever-vibrating mind.

We read a good deal and all to no purpose. Dry learning never brings
peace of mind. It never gives control over the mind. It never develops
the *will*, nor does it unfold the consciousness. It simply leads to
brain-fag; *mental cramp*.

*Diffusion of thoughts leads to confusion of results*. Now suppose the
brain to be a road filled with mud. A carriage rolls down the road. The
wheels have left a deep, straight track right along the road. Another

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

carriage passes on and *deepens* the track. It is exactly so with the
brain. One thought passes through it and a track is made through the
grey matter. The intensity of the thought will determine the depth of
the track.

As we think, nerve-tracks are created and the repetition of the same
thought deepens that nerve-track. New sets of atoms start into activity.
Brain-cells are multiplied, and fresh layers of matter cover up these
tracks. A similar thought gives them a blow and they are *shaken up*, as
it were, into new life.

Reading conveys suggestions to the brain and *induces* certain trains of
thought. The human will, if it presses a thought with vigor, increases
in force and mental electricity is thus generated. This is
"*thought-force*" in a nutshell.

Now far greater pressure is exerted if we think by ourselves. The fine
nerves of the brain put themselves in a state of tension, more life
flows into them, and, as this goes on, the inner powers of
consciousness, of which the brain is only an instrument, are called
forth from their potential into an *active, vigorous* condition.

We should read only those books which yield us fresh strong thoughts,
*in a line with* our own aims and aspirations in life. People take up a
book and start reading page after page with the speed of an express
train. The mind is in a state of utter confusion and but faint
impressions are being made. *This is most foolish*. Haste makes waste,
remember!

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Books contain thoughts. If these thoughts are *clean, pure, uplifting,
stimulating*, and *instructive* in nature, we should pause upon them and
*suck* all the life out of them.

Let a student sit down to read. Let him read a sentence slowly; then let
him try to grasp the thought, and think it over intently. *One thought
suggests other thoughts*. Thus let him think; stretch his imagination in
connection with that thought as far as possible, and drop it only when
he has found a clear-cut, distinct conclusion. Let him thus continue for
*fifteen teen minutes*. He will possibly feel quite tired at the end.
But as he continues the practice of deliberate thinking, he will feel a
new assurance of power awakening in his mind. "Read for five minutes;
think for ten"—there you have the whole secret.

The above practice is very easy, yet most valuable. It will expand your
brain and unfold your Higher Consciousness.

The fact is there is too little manhood in men. Earnestness of the right
sort is conspicuous by its absence. Such things as *spiritual
Unfoldment—the conquest of self*, are striven after by but few men.
Hence when they resolve upon achieving these, the initial difficulties
quench their ardour.

First of all we must idealise these Higher Teachings, if we have not
done so in the past. We must love them as the *only* things worthy of
achievement. It is not the passion of selfish growth that should grip
us, but the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

clear, cheerful atmosphere of purity that should be our guide.

Then when the thoughts of mind are strung up to action we should find
nothing difficult of achievement.

Come day, go day, we must stick to our resolve like grim death. *Nothing
can crush the spirit*, when it has learned to *recognise* itself.

Hence let us *cherish, nourish*, and *embellish* our Higher Nature by
taking upon our shoulder a little of the heavy Karma of the world. Let
us do all that we can for our growth, but let us remember that
selfishness when it develops is "like a serpent that warms to life by
the heat of our hands." Do not then nurse this viper in your bosom. Be
as helpful as you can.
