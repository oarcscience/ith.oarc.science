### CHAPTER VIII.

#### MAN—THE MASTER.

MEN are going up an ascending scale of existence. Some have their feet
still planted upon the lowest rungs of the ladder. Others have climbed
higher and higher.

At the start, the functions of life are all performed upon a
semiconscious plane. The law of life is for progress, struggle,
achievement and realization. The force of this law swings the physical
and mental mechanism of Man to its own beneficent purpose and propels
them to action. Progress at this stage is on the sub-conscious plane of
mentation.

The soul is in a comatose condition. Impacts from the physical world,
the driving power of the lave of Progress—Evolution,—and the inherent
powers of the soul, all combine to push us on.

Man's central Being is *infinite bliss*. I am Happiness itself. I am
unhappy because my eyes have grown blind.

Yes, Man has forgotten his real, divine Nature. Cycle after cycle of
activity thus goes on. Man is being worked upon by a Divine Law whose
stern mandate is "*Awake, Arise, and Stop not till the goal is
reached*."

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

Not all of us hear it thus. The pious Christian devoutly believes, "Oh,
There is an Evil Force, Satan, whose arm strikes me down. Good Lord,
Thou alone art my refuge."

In praying thus he believes in the Infinite power of the absolute; and
since nothing is lost in the economy of Nature, he delivers a
concentrated suggestion to his soul, which alone is Infinite. He
believes that his prayer will bear fruit, and it does. In believing he
delivers the right blow and his belief is fulfilled.

It is a very good thing to pray; to believe that Providence is always
playing with your destiny, to believe that a mighty Mephistopheles is
laying traps for you, to believe that the body dying, the soul does not
die, to believe that God alone can save you.

The good side of it lies in your repulsion of Evil. Fear and at times
love of the Infinite make you cleave to good.

But do not stop there. Your attitude is out and out a negative one. You
cannot always stand by your none-too-well-grounded convictions. Facts go
to prove this. In this world you often see a man born in poverty,
squalor and sin. He has not a single chance in life. Then take a man
born to the purple. There is nothing to vex him. Plenty stalks
majestically in the land. He has but to wish and to! it is fulfilled.

"Everything that God commands is for the best," you say. "Perhaps his
father is to blame," some one would say.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

First, why should I be punished for the sins of my father, secondly why
should I not be created as my friend is? Why should every one laugh at
my Physical, Mental and Spiritual endowments; how do I deserve this?

"God's ways are inexplicable," you say. Very fine, indeed!

Friend, God does not love mystery mongering. He can never give us pain
without rhyme or reason. My experience tells a different tale. God is
Love. He acts in open daylight. We go to Church and say long prayers for
sins committed. We shall commit that same sin again and again; and we
shall cease only when repeated blows rub the lesson home. "You must
cease from this. It has back of it the most painful results."

Man is punished not for his sins so much as by them. Nature with her
pitiless ways cannot claim mercy for herself. Her laws are hard. Be it a
sin of commission or of omission, your escape is impossible. This
penalty bears a mission peculiar to itself. Ili is a blessing in
disguise. It is the merciful knife of the surgeon. If there is loss,
pain, suffering, disappointment at one pole, it is all counterpoised by
the ripening of experience, wisdom, knowledge at the other. Hence
measured on the scale of Compensation, all pain, come it how it may,
must be faced with patience. Pain comes in jangled vibrations, seems to
asphyxiate the whole man, strikes us down for the needed lesson. In
suffering we pay our debts. The burden is lightened. Sin

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

and suffering are twins and separation is impossible. How we wish we had
been let off scot-free; how like miserable shirkers we wish our bed had
no crumpled rose leaves. Yet would you who weep and lament be minus the
experience and wisdom you have stored up through efforts to brush pain
aside? No right have we then to rule off pain as a visitation of a
wrathful Deity. Rather, we shall see Cause and Effect, not somewhere and
sometimes but everywhere and always. That is the position of Strength.
Every sweet has its sour. We shall confront fate with fate, fire with
fire, and, standing aside, see the one eat the other. The end of all
philosophy is the destruction of pain. Not milksops and lunatics, but
men of iron courage are philosophers. Philosophy is thought passed and
purified through the fire of the Living Spirit. It is deathless,
birthless truth established in the constitution of man. Clay and clay
differ, they say, so thought and thought vary in power, tenacity and
texture. Man is a living magnet. He attracts. He repels. He draws in his
own; he throws out what is not related to him. As Emerson, the western
child of eastern thought sings:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">‘And all that Nature made thy own,  
 Floating in air or pent in stone  
 Will rive the hills and swim the sea,  
 And, like thy shadow, follow thee.’</span>

</div>

Just that comes to us which is ours by right of thought; just that flies
off from us which is not ours,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What we seek we
shall find; what we flee from, will flee from us; as Goethe said, "What
we wish for in youth comes to us in heaps in old age." Everything on the
zone of our mental vibration will be ours. Remember you who read!
Thought is a mighty force. It is your friend. It is your enemy. As your
ideal in life, along that line will Everything flow. You are a Spark
from the Eternal Fire and as is proved in Higher Mathematics *the parts
of Infinity are an Infinity; you too are Infinite*. God re-Exists in
each mortal form. His light shines full upon your Consciousness. You
wish, you command, you demand, you assent, and you get—what you want;
though you go to sleep, your thought if sufficiently vitalized by
concentration will come to pass. Determine the breadth, the solidity,
the soundness of the plank of life you stand upon. You are your master.
Knowing and realizing this, you shall step up to the highest and best in
life and with firm hands pluck the fruit you would taste. The sweet, the
bitter, or the bitter-sweet taste is according as you choose. Where and
what is *Fear* then? It is all cause and effect. Laugh at Astrology, at
Palmistry; know their secrets; know they are emanations from you; and
stand fearless and strike straight from the shoulders, once, twice,
thrice, times innumerable till your strokes tell, till your strokes lay
low the monsters that have broken their teeth upon your unyielding
shoulders; till you have what you should have. *This, friend, is a
passing glimpse of Life's Conscious Stage. Here Life is
self-determined*.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Here no hand but
yours builds. No brains but yours thinks. No strength but yours avails.
No soul but yours bids, bargains and at last bears away the palm*.
