This is one of the Yogi Publication Society (YPS) titles, which may have
been in part or whole written by William Walker Atkinson. At the very
least, this volume seems to have been padded out a bit. The first few
chapters are consistent in tone and style, and discuss basics of Hindu
(or perhaps Theosophist) thought in very general terms, with lots of
italics and small caps for emphasis. There is even a realistic
description of a saddhu and a fishmarket in Benares ([p. 25 ff](dsc06)),
local color which you don't typically find in the YPS series. Hindu
technical terms are used correctly (and spelled correctly).

At or about page [88](dsc14) ('Constructive Idealism') the book veers
off into what appears to be New Thought. The second half of the book has
a lot more [typos](errata), including some spectacular mangling of Hindu
proper names, and a lot less italics. My guess is that this is a
conflation of a short manuscript written by an Indian, and some 'Mental
Focus' lessons that Atkinson recycled from a correspondence course.
There is some effort to maintain the Hindu theme in the second half, but
by pages [127-8](dsc17.htm#page_127) he's quoting [Hiram
Butler](../../astro/sb/index) and William James.

This is not one of the better-known YPS titles; it isn't mentioned on
Atkinson's Wikipedia page (at least not at the time I write this). In
spite of the big seam running down the middle of this book, there is
some good material in here, but it is sort of scattershot.<span
