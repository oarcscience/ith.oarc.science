### PART VI.

"THUS the Ideal Light was before the Ideal Light, and the luminous
Intelligence of Intelligence was always, and its unity was nothing else
than the Spirit enveloping the universe. Out of Whom is neither God, nor
Angels, nor any other essentials, for He is the Lord of all things and
the power and the light; and all depends on Him and is in Him. His
perfect Word, generative and creative, descending into generative Nature
and into generating water, rendered the water fruitful."

Having thus spoken, he rose and said:--"I adjure thee, Heaven, holy work
of the great God; I adjure thee, Voice of the Father, uttered in the
beginning when the universal world was framed; I adjure thee by the
Word, only Son of the Father Who upholds all things; be favorable, be
favorable!"
