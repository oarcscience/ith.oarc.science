### PART XIII.

LET us return to man, and enquire concerning the divine gift of reason
which entitles him to be called a reasonable creature. Among all the
wonders we have noted in man, that which above all commands admiration
is this:--that man has discovered the divinity of nature, and has made
it efficient to his designs. <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)

Our ancestors, wandering astray in matters of faith concerning the Gods,
and unable to lift their minds to the Divine knowledge and religion,
discovered the art of making Gods; and, having discovered it, they
invested their products with appropriate virtues drawn from the nature
of the world. And, as they could not make souls, they evoked the spirits
of genii and angels, and endowed with them the holy images and
sacraments, thus enabling their idols to exercise powers

for good or ill. In such wise thine ancestor, O Asclepios, the inventor
of medicine, has a temple on the Lybian mountain by the shores of the
crocodile-frequented river, where also lies enshrined all of him which
belonged to the earth--that is, his body. For the rest of him--his
better part, or rather, indeed, himself--because the principle of
consciousness and of life is the whole man--is restored to heaven. And
now, by his divinity, he lends help to men in their sicknesses, who once
instructed them in the art of healing. So also, Hermes, my own ancestor,
whose name I bear, now enshrined in the country which is called after
him, hears the prayers of those who come thither from all parts of the
land to obtain of him assistance and health. Behold, again, what
blessings Isis, the spouse of Osiris, confers upon men when she is
favourable to them, and what ills she inflicts when she is angered! For
these mundane and earthly Gods are accessible to wrath, being formed and
composed by men out of Nature. Of, such sort in Egypt is the adoration
paid to animals; and thus also do cities honour the souls of those men
who, in their lifetime, gave them laws and whose names they preserve.
And for this reason, O Asclepios, those deities which are adored in some
places, receive in others no worship; whence arise many wars between the
cities of Egypt.

*Asclepios*:

And of what kind, O Trismegistos, is the divinity of these Gods who
inhabit the earth?

\[*Hermes*:

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

*Hermes*:

It consists in the divine virtue, which naturally subsists in herbs,
rocks, and aromatic principles, wherefore these deities love frequent
sacrifices, hymns, and praises, and sweet music resembling the celestial
harmony, which heaven-like rite, attractive to their sacred nature,
draws them and retains them in their shrines, so that they patiently
endure their long sojourn among men. It is thus that men make Gods.
Neither must thou suppose, O Asclepios, that the acts of these
terrestrial deities are controlled by hazard. For while the supernal
Gods abide in the heights of heaven, keeping each the order which
belongs to him, these Gods of ours have also their special functions.
Some predict by means of lots and divination the events of the future;
others preside, in various ways, over things depending on their care, or
come to our assistance as allies, as kinsmen, or as friends.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[87:1](vow21.htm#fr_41.md) This section continues
and elucidates the argument of section IX. An acquaintance with occult
doctrine regarding the Nature-spirits, or mundane Gods, will, I think,
enable the reader to follow intelligently the observations of Hermes in
regard to the sacred images. Precisely the same virtues as those
attributed by the ancients to the idols of their various deities, are in
our day attributed by Catholics to the idols of their saints. We hear of
the "Virgin" of this or that town being propitious to a petition which
the "Virgin" of some other place has refused to grant. Sacred images
still heal the sick, avert pestilences, discover hidden springs, and
confer blessings upon devotees. <span id="page_88">p. 88</span> Hermes
points out that the powers by which these things are accomplished belong
to the divinity of Nature, individualised and differentiated by human
intervention; and that mankind necessarily passes through the stage of
nature-worship before becoming competent to realise the celestial order
and the being of the heavenly Gods. For before the empyrean can be
reached by the human intelligence, it must traverse the spheres
intermediate between earth and heaven. Thus the *images* of the Gods are
worshipped before the Gods themselves are known; nor are these images
necessarily of wood or stone. All personalities are eidola (idols)
reflecting the true essentials, and having, as it were, a portion of
Divinity attached to them and resident in their forms, but none the less
are they *images*, and however powerful and adorable they may appear to
the multitude who know not divine religion, they are to the Hermetist
but types and *persona* of essentials which are eternally independent of
manifestation and unaffected by it. The signs of the truly Divine are
three: transcendency of form, transcendency of time, transcendency of
personality. Instead of form is Essence; instead of time, Eternity;
instead of persons, Principles. Events become Processes, and phenomena,
Noumena. So long as the conception of any divine idea remains associated
with, or dependent on, any physical or historical circumstance, so long
it is certain that the heavenly plane has not been reached. Symbols,
when they are recognised as symbols, are no longer either deceptive or
dangerous; they are merely veils of light rendering visible the "Divine
Dark," towards which the true Hermetist aspires. Even the most refined,
the subtlest and most metaphysical expression of the supreme Truth is
still symbol and metaphor, for the Truth itself is unutterable, save by
God to God. It is Essence, Silence, Darkness.
