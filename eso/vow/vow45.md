### PART IV.

IF thou understandest this one and only Good, thou wilt find nothing
impossible, for all virtue is therein. Think not that this Good is in
anyone, nor that it is outside of anyone. It is without limit, being the
limit of all. Nothing contains it, it contains all in itself. For what
distinction is there between the corporeal and the incorporeal, the
create and the uncreate; that which is subject to necessity and that
which is free; between terrestrial things and things celestial,
corruptible things and things eternal?

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Is it not that
these subsist freely, and that those are subject to the bondage of
necessity? That which is below is imperfect and perishable.
