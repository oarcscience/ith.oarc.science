### PART VI.

O MY son, matter becomes; formerly it was, for matter is the vehicle of
becoming. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48) Becoming is the mode of
activity of the uncreate and foreseeing God. Having been

\[endowed

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

endowed with the germ of becoming, matter is brought into birth, for the
creative force fashions it according to the ideal forms. Matter not yet
engendered, had no form; it becomes when it is put into operation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[133:1](vow33.htm#fr_48) Dr. Menard observes
that in Greek, the same word signifies <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>
*to be born* and *to become*. The idea here is that the material of the
world is in its essence eternal, but that before creation or "becoming,"
it is in a passive and motionless condition. Thus it "was" before being
"put into operation;" now, it "becomes," that is, it is mobile and
progressive. Creation is thus the period of activity of God, who,
according to Hermetic thought, has two modes--Activity, or existence,
God evolved (Deus explicitus); and Passivity of Being--God involved
(Deus implicitus). Both modes are perfect and complete, as are the
waking and sleeping states of man. Fichte, the German philosopher,
distinguished Being (Seyn) as One, which we know only through existence
(Daseyn) as the Manifold. This view is thoroughly Hermetic. The "Ideal
Forms," mentioned in the above fragment, are the archetypal or formative
ideas of the Neo-Platonists; the eternal and subjective concepts of
things subsisting in the Divine Mind prior to "creation" or "becoming."
