### PART II.

IF thou reflectest, O King, thou wilt perceive that there are
incorporeal corporealites. Which are they? says the King. Corporealites
which appear in mirrors; are they not incorporeal?

It is true, Tat, says the King; thou hast a marvellous fancy!

There are yet other incorporealities; for instance, abstract forms, what
say you to them? Are they not in themselves incorporeal? yet they are
manifest in animated and inanimated corporealities.

True again, Tat.

So then there is a reflexion of incorporealities upon corporealities,
and of corporealities on incorporealities. In other words, the Sensible
World and the Ideal World reflect each other. Adore, then, the sacred
images, O King, for they also are reflective forms of the Sensible
World.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[107:1](vow25.htm#fr_46.md) As I read the above
fragment, it is written in a spirit of mirth. Tat is quibbling with the
King, as the manner of their talk plainly shows. Nevertheless, an
undercurrent of occult meaning runs through the speech of the son of
Trismegistos. When he names the sacred images, the allusion intended is
to the cultus of the Mysteries.--A.K.
