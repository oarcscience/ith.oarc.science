### PART VII.

SEVEN Planets revolve in the ways of Olympos, and by them Eternity is
measured:--The Moon which illumines the night, the gloomy Kronos, the
gentle Sun, the Paphian Goddess, protectress of marriage, the valiant
Ares, the fruitful Hermes, and Zeus the principle of birth and the fount
of nature. These, likewise, have received the human race in heritage;
and there are, within us, the Moon,

\[Zeus,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zeus, Ares,
Aphrodite, Kronos, Phoebus, Hermes. Moreover, we draw from the etherial
fluid our tears, our laughter, our wrath, our speech, our generation,
our sleep, our desire. Tears are of Kronos, generation of Zeus, speech
of Hermes, valour of Ares, sleep of Artemis, desire of Kytheræa
(Aphrodite), laughter of Apollo, for he it is who pours joy upon human
thought and on the infinite world.

<span class="small">\[This fragment, cited by Stobæus, is in verse, and
Heeren supposes it to be part of an Orphic hymn. It is thoroughly
Hermetic, and its recognition of Man as the epitome and reflex of the
universe is entirely in accord also with Kabbalistic
teaching.--A.K.\]</span>
