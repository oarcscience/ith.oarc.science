*The Virgin of the World*, by Anna Kingsford and Edward Maitland,
\[1884\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *NOTE*.

In presenting the "Virgin of the World"--which with my "Hargrave
Jennings" Edition of the "Divine Pymander," now so much in repute and
demand, are the text books of Hermetic thought--it is no act of
supererogation to gratefully acknowledge my appreciation of the valued
services of all associated with me in the privileged task of once again
reviving those priceless writings of that "Master Initiate," "Hermes
Mercurius Trismegistus;" (to be shortly supplemented by the Third
Volume, or "Golden Treatise concerning the Physical Secret of the
Philosopher's Stone, in seven sections," esteemed one of the best and
oldest pieces of Alchemical Philosophy extant; comprising, in epitome,
the whole Art, and secret method of its confection, with corroborative
annotations from Fludd, Behmem, Vaughan, &c.

Bath; May, 1885.
