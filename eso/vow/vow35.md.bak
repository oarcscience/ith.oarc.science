### PART VIII.

TO understand God is difficult; to speak of God, impossible. For the
corporeal cannot express the incorporeal; the imperfect cannot
comprehend the perfect. How is the eternal to be associated with the
transient? The first abides for ever, the other is fleeting; the first
is the Real, the other is a reflected shadow. As much as weakness
differs from strength, or smallness from greatness, so much the mortal
differs from the divine. The distance which divides them one from the
other obscures the vision of the beautiful. Bodies are visible to sight,
and that which the eye beholds the tongue is able to express. But that
which has not any body, nor appearance, nor form, nor matter, cannot be
apprehended by sense.

I understand, O Tatios, I understand that which it is impossible to
define--that is God.
