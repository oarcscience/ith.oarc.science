### I.

\*           \*           \*           \*

HAVING thus spoken, Isis first pours out for Horos the sweet draught of
immortality which souls receive from the Gods, and thus begins the most
holy discourse. Heaven, crowned with stars, is placed above universal
nature, O my son Horos, and nothing is wanting to it of that which
constitutes the whole world. It is necessary, then, that all nature
should be adorned and completed by that which is above her, for this
Order could not proceed from below to above. The supremacy

\[of

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

of the greater mysteries over the lesser is imperative. Celestial order
reigns over terrestrial order, as being absolutely determined, and
inaccessible to the idea of death. Wherefore, the things below lament,
being filled with fear before the marvellous beauty and eternal
permanence of the heavenly world. For, indeed, a spectacle worthy of
contemplation and desire were these magnificences of heaven, revelations
of the God as yet unknown, and this sumptuous majesty of night illumined
with a penetrating radiance, albeit less than that of the sun, and all
these other mysteries which move above in harmonious cadence, ruling and
maintaining the things below by secret influences. And so long as the
Universal Architect refrained from putting an end to this incessant
fear, to these anxious investigations, ignorance enveloped the universe.
But when He judged good to reveal Himself to the world, He breathed into
the Gods the enthusiasm of love, and poured into their mind the
splendour which His bosom contained, that they might first be inspired
with the will to seek, next with the desire to find, and lastly with the
power to readjust.

Now, my wondrous child Horos, all this could not happen among mortals,
for as yet they did not exist; but it took place in the universal Soul
in sympathy with the mysteries of heaven. This was Hermes, the Kosmic
Thought. He beheld the universe of things, and having seen, he
understood, and having understood, he had the power to manifest and to
reveal. That which he thought, he wrote; that which he wrote, he in
great part concealed, wisely silent. and speaking by turns, so that
while the world should last, these things might be sought. And thus,
having enjoined upon the Gods, his brethren, that they should follow in
his train, he ascended to the

\[stars.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

stars. But he had for successor his son, and the heir of his knowledges,
Tat, and a little later, Asclepios, son of Imouthè, by the counsels of
Pan and Hephaistos, <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) and all those
for whom sovereign Providence reserved an exact knowledge of heavenly
things.

Hermes then justified himself in the presence of those who surrounded
him, in that he had not delivered the integral theory to his son, on
account of his youth. But I, having arisen, beheld with mine eyes, which
see the invisible secrets of the beginnings of things, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) and at length, but with certainty, I
understood that the sacred symbols of the Kosmic elements were hidden
near the secrets of Osiris. Hermes returned to heaven, having pronounced
an invocatory speech.

It is not fitting, O my Son, that this recital be left incomplete; thou
must be informed of the words of

\[Hermes

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hermes when he
laid down his books. "O sacred books," he said, "of the Immortals, ye in
whose pages my hand has recorded the remedies by which incorruptibility
is conferred, remain for ever beyond the reach of destruction and of
decay, invisible and concealed from all who frequent these regions,
until the day shall come in which the ancient heaven shall bring forth
instruments worthy of you, whom the Creator shall call souls."

Having pronounced upon his books this invocation, he wrapped them in
their coverings, returned into the sphere which belonged to him, and all
remained hidden for a sufficient space.

And Nature, O my Son, was barren until the hour in which those who are
ordained to survey the heavens, advancing towards God, the King of all
things, deplored the general inertia, and affirmed the necessity of
setting forth the universe. No other than Himself could accomplish this
work.

"We pray Thee," said they, "to consider that which already is, and that
which is necessary for the future."

At these words, the God smiled benignant, and commanded Nature to exist.
And, issuing with His voice, the FEMININE came forth in her perfect
beauty. The Gods with amaze beheld this marvel. And the great Ancestor,
pouring out for Nature an elixir, commanded her to be fruitful; and
forthwith, penetrating the universe with His glance, He cried, "Let
heaven be the plenitude of all things, and of the air, and of the
ether." God spake, and it was done. But Nature, communing with herself,
understood that she might not transgress the commandment of the Father,
and, uniting herself to Labour, she produced a most beautiful daughter,
whom she called Invention, and to whom God accorded being.

And having differentiated created forms, He filled

\[them

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

them with mysteries, and gave the command of them to Invention.

Then, not willing that the upper world should be inactive, He saw fit to
fill it with spirits, in order that no region should remain in
immobility and inertia; and in the accomplishment of His work He used
His sacred art. For, taking of Himself such essence as was necessary,
and mingling with it an intellectual flame, He combined with these other
materials by unknown ways. And having achieved by secret formulas the
union of these principles, He endowed with motion the universal
combination. Gradually, in the midst of the protoplasm, glittered a
substance more subtle, purer, more limpid, than the elements from which
it was generated. It was transparent, and the Artist alone perceived it.
Soon, it attained its perfection, being neither melted by the fire, nor
chilled by the breath, but possessing the stability of a special
combination, and having its proper type and constitution. He bestowed on
it a happy name, and, according to the similitude of its energies, He
called it Self-Consciousness.

Of this product he formed myriads of Souls, employing the choicest part
of the mixture for the end which He had in view, proceeding with order
and measure, according to His knowledge and His reason. The souls were
not necessarily different, but the choicest part, animated by the Divine
motion, was not identical with the rest. The first layer was superior to
the second, more perfect and pure; the second, inferior truly to the
first, was superior to the third; and thus, until sixty degrees, was
completed the total number. Only, God established this law, that all
equally should be eternal, being of one essence, whose forms He alone
determines. He traced the limits of their sojourn on the heights

\[of

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

of nature, so that they might turn the wheel according to the laws of
Order and of wise discretion, for the joy of their Father.

Then, having summoned to these splendid regions of ether the souls of
every grade, He said to them: "O souls, beautiful children of my breath
and of my care, you whom I have produced with my hands, in order to
consecrate you to my universe, hear my words as a law:--Quit not the
place assigned to you by my will. The abode which awaits you is heaven,
with its galaxy of stars and its thrones of virtue. If you attempt any
transgression against my decree, I swear by my sacred breath, by that
elixir of which I formed you, and by my creative hands, that I will
speedily forge for you chains and cast you into punishment."

Having thus spoken, God, my Master, mingled together the rest of the
congenial elements, earth and water, and pronouncing certain powerful
and mystic words--albeit different from the first--He breathed into the
liquid protoplasm motion and life, rendered it thicker and more plastic,
and formed of it living beings of human shape. That which remained He
gave to the loftiest souls inhabiting the region of the Gods in the
neighbourhood of the stars, who are called the Sacred Genii. "Work,"
said He, "my children, offspring of my nature; take the residue of my
task, and let each one of you make beings in his image. I will give you
models."

Therewith He took the Zodiac and ordained the world in conformity with
-vital movements, placing the animal signs after those of human form.
And after having given forth the creative forces and generative breath
for the whole range of beings yet to come, He

\[withdrew,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

withdrew, promising to unite to every visible work an invisible breath
and a reproductive principle, so that each being might engender its
similar without necessity to create continually new entities. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

And what did the souls do, O my Mother?

And Isis answered:--They took the mingled material, O my Son Horos, and
began to reflect thereon, and to adore this combination, the work of the
Father. Next, they sought to discover of what it was composed, which,
indeed, it was not easy to find. Then, fearing

\[that

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

that this search might excite the anger of the Father, they set
themselves to carry out His commands. Therefore, taking the upper
portion of the protoplasm, that which was lightest, they created of it
the race of birds. The compound having now become more compact and
assuming a denser consistency, they formed of it the quadrupeds; while
of the thickest part which needed a moist vehicle for its support, they
made fishes. The remainder, being cold and heavy, was employed by the
souls in the creation of reptiles.

Forthwith, O my Son, proud of their work, they were not afraid to
transgress the Divine law, and, in spite of the prohibition, they
receded from their appointed limits. Not willing to remain longer in the
same abode, they moved ceaselessly, and repose seemed to them
death. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)

But, O my Son--(thus Hermes informed me)--their conduct could not escape
the eye of the Lord God of all things; He minded to punish them, and to
prepare for them hard bonds. The Ruler and Master of the universe
resolved then for the penance of the souls, to mould the human organism,
and having called me to

\[Him

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him, said Hermes,
He spoke in this wise:--"O soul of my soul, holy thought of my thought,
how long shall earthly Nature remain sad? How long shall the creation
already produced continue inactive and without praise? Bring hither
before me all the Gods of heaven."

Thus God spake, quoth Hermes, and all obeyed His decree. "Look upon the
earth," He said to them, "and upon all things beneath,"

Straightway they looked, and understood the will of the Lord. And when
He spoke to them of the creation of Man, asking of each what he could
bestow upon the race about to be born, the Sun first replied:--"I will
illumine mankind." Then the Moon promised enlightenment in her turn,
adding that already she had created Fear, Silence, Sleep, and Memory.
Kronos announced that he had begotten Justice and Necessity. Zeus said,
"In order to spare the future race perpetual wars, I have generated
Fortune, Hope, and Peace." Ares declared himself already father of
Conflict, impetuous Zeal, and Emulation, Aphrodite did not wait to be
called upon: "As for me, O Master," she said, "I will bestow upon
mankind Desire, with voluptuous Joy and Laughter, that the penalty, to
which our sister Souls are destined may not weigh on them too hardly."
These words of Aphrodite, O my Son, were welcomed gladly. "And I," said
Hermes, "will endow human nature with Wisdom, Temperance, Persuasion,
and Truth; nor will I cease to ally myself with Invention. I will ever
protect the mortal life of such men as are born under my signs, seeing
that to me the Creator and Father has attributed in the Zodiac, signs of
Knowledge and Intelligence; above all, when the movement

\[ment

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

which draws thereto the stars is in harmony with the physical forces of
each." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

He Who is Master of the world rejoiced at hearing these things, and
decreed the production of the human race. As for me--said Hermes--I
sought what material ought to be employed in the work, and invoked the
Lord. He commanded the Souls to give up the residue of the protoplastic
substance, which having taken, I found it entirely dried up. Therefore,
I used a great excess of water wherewith to renew the combination of the
substance, in such wise that the product might be resolvable, yielding,
and feeble, and that Force should not be added therein to Intelligence.
When I had achieved my work it was beautiful, and I rejoiced in seeing
it. And from below I called upon the Lord to behold what I had done. He
saw it, and approved. Straightway He ordained that the Souls should be
incorporated; and they were seized [with](errata.htm#1.md) horror on
learning what should be their condemnation.

These words, said Isis, struck me. Hearken, my son Horos, for I teach
thee a mystery. Our ancestor Kamephes had it also from Hermes, who
inscribes the recital of all things; I, in turn, received it from the
ancient Kamephes when he admitted me to the initiation of the black
veil; <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) and thou, likewise, O
marvellous and illustrious child, receive it from me.

\[The

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

The Souls were about to be imprisoned in bodies, whereat some sighed and
lamented, as when some wild and free animal suddenly enchained, in the
first moment of subjection to hard servitude and of severance from the
beloved habits of the wilderness, struggles and revolts, refusing to
follow its conqueror, and if occasion presents itself, slaying him.
Others, again, hissed like serpents, or gave vent to piercing cries and
sorrowful words, glancing aimlessly from height to depth.

"Great Heaven," said one, "principle of our birth, ether, pure airs,
hands, and sacred breath of the sovereign God, and you, shining Stars,
eyes of the Gods, unwearying light of Sun and Moon, our early brethren,
what grief, what rending is this! Must we quit these vast, effulgent
spaces, this sacred sphere, all these splendors of the empyrean and of
the happy republic of the Gods, to be precipitated into these vile and
miserable abodes? What crime, O wretched ones, have we committed? How
can we have merited, poor sinners that we are, the penalties which await
us? Behold the sad future in store for us--to minister to the wants of a
fluctuating and dissoluble body! No more may our eyes distinguish the
souls divine! Hardly through these watery spheres shall we perceive,
with sighs, our ancestral heaven; at intervals even we shall cease
altogether to behold it. By this disastrous sentence direct vision is
denied to us; we can see only by the aid of the outer light; these are
but windows that we possess--not eyes. Nor will our pain be less when we
hear in the air the fraternal breathing of the winds with which no
longer can we mingle our own, since that will have for its dwelling,
instead of the sublime and open world, the narrow prison of the breast!
But Thou, Who drivest us forth, and causest us from so

\[high

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

high a seat to descend so low, assign a limit to our sufferings! O
Master and Father, so quickly become indifferent to Thy handiwork,
appoint a term to our penance, deign to bestow on us some last words,
while yet we are able to behold the expanse of the luminous spheres!"

This prayer of the Souls was granted, my son Horos, for the Lord was
present; and sitting upon the throne of Truth, thus He addressed them:--

"O Souls; you shall be governed by Desire and Necessity; after me, these
shall be your masters and your guides. Souls, subjected to my sceptre
which never fails, know that inasmuch as you remain stainless you shall
inhabit the regions of the skies. If among you any be found to merit
reproach, they shall inhabit abodes destined to them in mortal
organisms. If your faults be light, you shall, delivered from the bond
of the flesh, return to heaven. But if you become guilty of graver
crime, if you turn away from the end for which you have been formed,
then indeed you shall dwell neither in heaven nor in human bodies, but
thenceforth you shall pass into those of animals without reason." <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

Having thus spoken, O my son Horos, He breathed upon them and said, "It
is not according to chance that I have ordained your destiny; if you act
ill, it will be worse; it will be better if your actions are worthy of
your birth. It is myself and not another who will be your witness and
your judge. Understand that it is because of your past errors that you
are to be punished and shut up in fleshly bodies. In different bodies,
as I have already told you, your re-births will be different.
Dissolution shall be a benefit, restoring your former happy condition.
But if your conduct be unworthy of me, your prudence, becoming blinded
and guiding you backwards, will cause you to take for good fortune that
which is really a chastisement, and to dread a happier lot as though it
were a cruel injury. The most just among you shall, in their future
transformations, approximate to the

\[divine

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

divine, becoming among men, upright kings, true philosophers, leaders
and legislators, true seers, collectors of salutary plants, cunning
musicians, intelligent astronomers, wise augurs, instructed ministrants:
all beautiful and good offices; as among birds are the eagles which
pursue not nor devour those of their own kind, and do not permit weaker
ones to be attacked in their presence, because justice is in the nature
of the eagle; among quadrupeds, the lion, for he is a strong animal,
untamed by slumber, in a mortal body performing immortal toils, and by
nothing tired nor beguiled; among reptiles, the dragon, because he is
powerful, living long, innocent, and a friend of men, allowing himself
to be tamed, having no venom, and, leaving old age, approximating to the
nature of the Gods; among fishes, the dolphin, for this creature, taking
pity on those who fall into the sea, will carry them to land if they
still live, and will abstain from devouring them if dead, although it is
the most voracious of all aquatic animals."

Having spoken these words, God became an Incorruptible Intelligence
(i.e., resumed the unmanifest).

After these things, my son Horos, there arose out of the earth an
exceeding powerful Spirit, unencumbered with any corporeal envelope,
strong in wisdom, but savage and fearful; although he could not be
ignorant of the knowledge he sought, seeing the type of the human body
to be beautiful and august of aspect, and perceiving that the souls were
about to enter into their envelopes:

"What are these," said he, "O Hermes, Secretary of the Gods?" "These are
men," replied Hermes. "It is a rash work," said he, "to make man with
such penetrating eyes, such a subtle tongue, such a delicate

\[hearing

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

hearing that can hear even those things which concern him not, such a
fine scent, and in. his hands a sense of touch capable of appropriating
everything. O generating Spirit, thinkest thou it is well that he should
be free from care--this future investigator of the fine mysteries of
Nature? Wilt thou leave him exempt from suffering--he whose thought will
search out the limits of the earth? Mankind will dig up the roots of
plants, they will study the properties of natural juices, they will
observe the nature of stones, they will dissect not only animals but
themselves, desiring to know how they have been formed. They will
stretch forth their daring hands over the sea, and, cutting down the
timber of the wild forest, they will pass from shore to shore seeking
one another. They will pursue the inmost secrets of Nature even into the
heights, and will study the motions of heaven. Nor is this enough; when
nothing yet remains to be known than the furthest boundary of the earth,
they will seek even there the last extremities of night. If they
apprehend no obstacle, if they live exempt from trouble, beyond reach of
any fear or of any anxiety, even heaven itself will not arrest their
audacity; they will seek to extend their power over the elements. Teach
them, then, desire and hope, in such wise that they may know likewise
the dread of accident and of difficulty, and the painful sting of
expectation deceived. Let the curiosity of their souls have for balance,
desire and fear, care and vain hope. Let their souls be a prey to mutual
love, to aspirations and varied longings, now satisfied, now deceived,
so that even the sweetness of success may be an allurement to draw them
towards misfortune. Let the weight of fevers oppress them, and break in
them all desire."

Thou sufferest, Horos, in hearing this thy mother's

\[recital?

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

recital? Surprise and wonder seize thee in presence of the evils which
now fall upon poor humanity? That which thou art about to hear is still
more sad. The speech of Momos pleased Hermes; he deemed his advice good,
and he followed it.

"O, Momos," said he, "the nature of the divine breath which enwraps all
things shall not be ineffectual! The Master of the universe has charged
me to be His agent and overseer. The Deity of the penetrating eye
(Adrastia) <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) will observe and direct
all events; and for my part, I will design a mysterious instrument, a
measure inflexible and inviolable, to which everything shall be subject
from birth even to final destruction, and which shall be the bond of
created entities. This instrument shall rule that which is on the earth,
and all the rest."

It is thus--quoth Hermes--that I spoke to Momos; and forthwith the
instrument operated. Straightway the souls were incorporated, and I was
praised for my work.

Then the Lord summoned anew the assembly of the Gods. They gathered
together, and He thus addressed them:

"Gods, who have received a sovereign and imperishable nature, and the
sway of the vast eternity, ye whose office it is to maintain unceasingly
the mutual harmony of things, how long shall we govern an empire
unknown? How long shall creation re-main invisible to the sun and moon?
Let each of

\[us

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

us undertake his part in the universe. By the exercise of our power let
us put an end to the cohesion of inertia. Let chaos become a fable,
incredible to posterity. Inaugurate your great labours; I will direct
you."

He said, and immediately the Kosmic unity, until now obscure, was
opened, and in the heights appeared the heavens with all their
mysteries. The earth, hitherto unstable, grew more solid beneath the
brightness of the sun, and stood forth adorned with enfolding riches.
All things are beautiful in the eyes of God, even that which to mortals
appears uncomely, because all is made according to the divine laws. And
God rejoiced in beholding His works filled with movement; and with
outstretched hands grasping the treasures of nature. "Take these," He
said, "O sacred earth, take these, O venerable one, who art to be the
mother of all things, and henceforth let nothing be lacking to thee!"

With these words, opening His divine hands, He poured His treasures into
the universal font. But yet they were unknown, for the souls newly
embodied and unable to support their opprobrium, sought to enter into
rivalry with the celestial Gods, and, proud of their lofty origin,
boasting an equal creation with these, revolted. Thus men became their
instruments, opposed to one another, and fomenting civil wars. And thus,
force oppressing weakness, the strong burnt and massacred the feeble,
and quick and dead were thrust forth from the sacred places.

Then the elements resolved to complain before the Lord of the savage
condition of mankind. For the evil being already very grievous, the
elements hastened

\[to

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

to God the Creator, and pleaded in this wise--the fire being suffered to
speak first:-- <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

"O Master," he said, "Maker of this new world, Thou whose name,
mysterious among the Gods, has hitherto been revered among all men; how
long, O Divinity, halt Thou decreed to leave human life without God?
Reveal Thyself to the world which calls for Thee, correct its savage
existence by the institution of peace. Grant unto life, law, grant unto
night oracles; fill all things with happy auguries; let

\[men

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

men fear the judgment of the Gods, and no man shall sin any more. Let
crimes receive their just punishment, and men will abstain from
unrighteousness. They will fear to violate oaths, and madness will have
an end. Teach them gratitude for benefits, so shall I devote my flame to
pure offerings and libations, and the altars shall yield Thee
exhalations of sweet savours. For now I am polluted, O Master, because
the impious temerity of men forces me to consume flesh. They will not
suffer me to remain in my nature; they pervert and corrupt my purity!"

The air spoke in its turn:--"I am defiled by the effluvium of corpses, O
Master; I am becoming pestilent and unwholesome, and from on high I
witness things which I ought not to behold."

Then the water took up the word, and spoke on this wise, O my
illustrious son:--

"Father and wondrous Creator of all things, Divinity incarnate, Author
of Nature who brings forth all through Thee, command the waters of the
streams to be always pure, for now both rivers and seas are compelled to
bathe the destroyer and to receive his victims!"

Then at the last the earth appeared, O my glorious son, and thus
began:--

"O King, Chief of celestial choirs and Lord of their orbits, Master and
Father of the elements which lend to all things increase and decrease,
and into which all must return; behold how the impious and insensate
tribe of man overspreads me, O venerable One, since by Thy commands I am
the habitation of all beings, bearing them all and receiving into my
bosom all that is slain; such is now my reproach. Thy terrestrial world
in which all creatures are contained

\[is bereft

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

is bereft of God. And because they revere nothing, they transgress every
law and overwhelm me with all manner of evil works. To my shame, O Lord,
I admit into myself the product of the corruption of carcases. But I,
who receive all things, would fain also receive God. Grant to earth this
grace, and if Thou comest not Thyself--for indeed I cannot contain
Thee--let me at least receive some holy efflux of Thee. Let the earth
become the most glorious of all the elements; and since she alone gives
all things to all, may she revere herself as the recipient of Thy
favours."

Thus the elements discoursed, and forthwith God filled the universe with
His divine voice. "Go," said He, "sacred offspring, worthy of your
Father's greatness, seek not to change anything, nor refuse to my
creatures your ministry. I will send you an efflux of myself, a pure
Being who shall investigate all actions, who shall be the dreadful and
incorruptible Judge of the living; and sovereign justice shall extend
its reign even into the shades beneath the earth. Thus shall every man
receive his merited deserts."

Thereupon the elements ceased from their complaints, and each of them
resumed its functions and its sway.

And in what manner, O my mother, said Horos, did the earth afterwards
obtain this efflux of God?

I will not recount this Nativity, said Isis; I dare not, O powerful
Horos, declare the origin of thy race, lest men in the future should
learn the generation of the Gods. I will say only that the Supreme God,
Creator and Architect of the world, at length accorded to earth for a
season, thy father Osiris and the great Goddess Isis, that they might
bring the expected

\[salvation.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

salvation. By them life attained its fulness; savage and bloody wars
were ended; they consecrated temples to the Gods their ancestors, and
instituted oblations. They gave to mortals law, nourishment, and
raiment. "They shall read," Hermes said, "my mystic writings, and
dividing them into two parts, they shall keep certain of them, and
inscribe upon columns and obelisks those which may be useful to man."
Institutors of the first tribunals, they established everywhere the
reign of order and justice. With them began the faith of treaties, and
the introduction into human life of the religious duty of oaths. They
taught the rites of sepulture towards those who cease to live; they
interrogated the horrors of death; they shewed that the spirit from
without delights to return into the human body, and that if the way of
entry be shut against it, it brings about a failure of life. Instructed
by Hermes, they engraved upon hidden tables that the air is filled with
genii. Instructed by Hermes in the secret laws of God, they alone were
the teachers and legislators of mankind, initiating them in the arts,
the sciences, and the benefits of civilised life. Instructed by Hermes
concerning the sympathetic affinities which the Creator has established
between heaven and earth, they instituted religious representations and
sacred mysteries. And, considering the corruptible nature of all bodies,
they ordained prophetic initiation, so that the prophet who lifts his
hands to the Gods should be instructed in all things, and that thereby
philosophy and magic might provide nourishment for the soul, and
medicine might heal the sufferings of the flesh.

Having performed all these things, O my son, and seeing the world
arrived at its fulness, Osiris and I were recalled by the inhabitants of
heaven; but we

\[could

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

could not return thither without having first praised the Lord, so that
the celestial Vision might fill the expanse, and that the way of a happy
ascension might open before us, since God delights in hymns.

O my mother, said Horos, teach me this hymn, that I also may be
instructed in it.

Hearken, my son, answered Isis.        .        .        .

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[3:1](vow06.htm#fr_15.md) The text of this passage
presents great difficulties and uncertainties. The words in Canter's
edition, Ἀσκληπιὸς ὁ ἰμούθης σπανὸς και ἡφαίστου βουλαῖς, Canter reads
Asclepios, Amnion, and Hephaistobulus. Patrizzi changes ἡφαίστου βουλαῖς
into ἡφαιστοβούλης and renders it Asclepios Imuthes, Spanos and
Hephæstobulus. Others read πανός in place of σπανός, which is plausible
enough, but at the same time they preserve ἡφαιστοβούλης, and then
ἰμούθης becomes a surname of Asclepios, who would thus be son of Pan and
Hephaistoboulè, an absolutely unknown goddess. But in another fragment
we read, a little further on, Ἀσκληπιὸς ὁ ἰμούθης and Ἀσκληπιὸς ὁ
ἰμούθης, and the word πάλιν indicates that it refers to the same
Asclepios, and not to two persons of the same name. It may be, then,
that Imouthè was the name of his mother, as Fabricius supposes. Is it
not likely that it is the Greek form of "Mouth"? The Egyptian Asclepios
was represented bald, according to Synésios; the word σπανός, which
means bald, might then be retained. But in this case, in order that the
phrase may have a meaning, it would be necessary to change βουλαῖς into
βουλαῖος, and translate:--Asclepios, the bald Imouthès, and counsellor
of Hephaistos.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[3:2](vow06.htm#fr_16.md) This sentence is very
obscure; the participles are in the masculine, as though the author had
forgotten that a goddess was speaking. I believe the text of the passage
must have been altered.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[7:1](vow06.htm#fr_17.md) This recital of the
creation of the souls recalls the *Timæus* of Plato. After all the Gods
were born, the Artificer of the universe thus addressed them: "Gods of
gods, of whom I am the Creator and Father, and who, formed by me, are by
my will indissoluble, learn what I now say to you. . . . In order that
mortal natures may exist, and that the universe may be indeed universal,
turn yourselves according to your nature to the formation of animals,
imitating the power which I employed in the generation of yourselves. .
. . I myself will deliver the seeds and beginnings; and for the rest do
you weave together the mortal and immortal nature, constructing and
producing animals." He said, and into the same cup in which He had
mingled and tempered the soul of the universe, He poured the residue,
and mixed it in the same manner, but in less pure combinations of a
second and third order. And having constituted the universe, He allotted
souls to the stars in equal number, distributing each to each; and
causing every one to mount his vehicle, He displayed to them the nature
of the universe, and taught them the laws of Destiny.

\[It may be added, also, that this legend, quaint and grotesque as it is
in many of its details, is, likewise, in accord with the Kabbala, which
recounts the pre-mundane history of the souls, their creation, their
transgression, and their punishment, in much the same fashion. The
creation of the visible world by the "working gods," or Titans, as
agents for the Supreme God, is a thoroughly Hermetic idea, recognizable
in all religious systems, and in accord with modern scientific research,
which shews us everywhere the Divine Power operating secretly through
natural forces.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[8:1](vow06.htm#fr_18.md) In reading this allegory,
it must be borne in mind that the word "Soul" is used as a general term
for all Egos or Intelligences, whether Genii or Men. Further, that in
these Fragments, as in the Hebrew Scriptures, the same truths are
repeated under different symbols in different passages. Hence the
creation of Nature and of "differentiated forms" has already been
otherwise depicted in a previous paragraph; and the whole process of the
evolution of the Soul has been epitomized in the fable of the making of
the protoplasm. The descent into generation occurs, actually, when the
Titans first begin the manipulation of this protoplasm. The human body,
although last in manifestation, is really the first in the Divine
intention, and is the ultimate cause of all the series of objective
forms. Hermetically speaking, there is nothing in the whole universe,
save Man.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[10:1](vow06.htm#fr_19.md) Heeren sees in these
metaphors an allusion to the creation of Pandora in Hesiod. They recall
also a passage in the Pymander, wherein the Rulers of the Seven Planets
cause Man to participate in their nature; an idea developed likewise by
Macrobius in his commentary on the Dream of Scipio.--*Lib. L., chap.
xii*.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[10:2](vow06.htm#fr_20.md) Canter translates this
by *atramenturn*, which would signify initiation by writing; but it is
possible that the heads of the initiated persons were covered with a
black veil, or perhaps the veil of Isis is here intended.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[12:1](vow06.htm#fr_21.md) It has been questioned
whether Hermetic doctrine affirms the Hindu theory of transmigration, to
wit--the possibility of the passage of the guilty Ego into lower forms
than that of man. We must, I hold, admit the orthodoxy of the doctrine,
which, when rightly understood, involves no paradox. In the Divine
Pymander, it is clearly set forth that if a human soul continue evil "it
shall neither taste of immortality nor be partaker of the good, but
being drawn back it returneth into creeping things; and this is the
condemnation of an evil soul." Yet, Trismegistus hastens immediately to
explain and qualify this statement by adding that such a calamity cannot
befall any truly human soul--that is, a soul possessing the divine Mind,
however fallen from grace, for so long as the soul retains this living
fire <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> it is the soul of a man, and man
"is not to be compared to any brute beast upon the earth, but to them
that are above in heaven, that are called Gods." But there is a
condition so low and lost that at length the divine flame is quenched,
and the soul is left dark and Godless, a human soul no longer. "And such
a soul, O Son," says Hermes, "hath no Mind; *wherefore neither must such
an one be called Man*." Therefore, while it is true that "no other body
is capable of a human soul, neither is it lawful for a man's soul to
fall into the body of an unreasonable living thing," so also is it true
that a soul, bereft of its Divine Particle which alone made it human, is
human no longer, and, following the universal law of affinity,
straightway gravitates to its proper level, sinking to its similars, and
drawn to its analogues. Nevertheless, when its purgation is
accomplished, such a soul may "come to itself and say, I will arise and
go unto my Father."

There are some Rabbis indeed who have thought such an occult
significance to lie hid in the parable of the prodigal; swine being
accounted universally a figure of lust and sordid desire. The Hermetic
doctrine, thus interpreted, is identical with that of the Kabbala on the
same point, as we shall elsewhere have occasion to shew; and also with
the teaching of Apollonius of Tyana.--(*v. Perfect Way*, III., 21, etc.)

<span id="fn_22"></span>[16:1](vow06.htm#fr_22.md) This name appears to
have been a marginal interpolation, inserted into the text by a copyist.
It serves as a key to what follows, Adrastia (or Nemesis) being the
personification of the necessary law (or inflexible instrument) of which
Hermes is about to speak.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[18:1](vow06.htm#fr_23.md) In the Book of Enoch a
similar legend appears--"The Giants turned themselves upon men to devour
them, and began to do evil to birds and beasts of the field and reptiles
and fish; and they devoured with one accord their flesh and drank their
blood. When the earth lifted up her voice against the unjust, . . . .
and because of the perdition of men, a cry arose that came even unto
heaven. Therefore, Michael and Gabriel, and Souryan and Ouryan, looked
forth from the height of heaven, and beheld the abundance of blood that
was shed upon the earth, and all the iniquity that was accomplished, and
they said one to another:--The voice of their cries ascends, the clamour
of the earth is heard even at the gates of heaven, and before you, O
holy ones of the skies, the souls of men complain, saying--Avenge us in
the presence of the Lord. (VII. 14, 15; VIII. 8, 9; IX. 1, 2, 3.)

\[See also the first book of Ovid's Metamorphoses, V., VI., VII. In all
these accounts it appears that mankind is inspired to wickedness and
impiety by the Giants, who are, in Hermetic teaching, explained to be
the lower mundane forces, or "fallen Angels." They are, probably, the
first created "souls" mentioned in an early passage of the allegory, and
are elsewhere spoken of as Demons. Almost all the poets, whether Hebrew,
Hellenic, Hindu, Persian, Norse, or Christian, celebrate the revolt of
the Giants against heaven. It is needless to remind the reader that all
these sacred fables have an esoteric and individual application, related
to the Microcosm within man, as well as to the Macrocosm or world
without. The text is manifestly imperfect.
