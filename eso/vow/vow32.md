### PART V.

HERE, then, is that which can be said of the three tenses. They are not
by themselves, and they are not bound together; again, they are bound
together and are by themselves. Can the present be supposed without the
existence of the past? One cannot exist without another, for the present
is generated by the past, and from the present the future comes forth.
If we wish to go to the root of the matter, we must reason thus:--The
past tense is withdrawn into that which no longer is; the future is not
so long as it has not become present; the present, in its turn, ceases
to be itself the instant that it remains. Can that which does not endure
for an instant and which has no fixed centre be called present when it
cannot even be said to exist? Moreover, since the past is
indistinguishable from the present, and the present from the future,
they become one. There is among them identity, unity, continuity.
Therefore time is continuous and divisible, even while it is one and
identical.
