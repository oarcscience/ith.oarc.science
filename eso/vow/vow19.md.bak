### PART XI.

SINCE such is the state of the universe, there is nothing immutable,
nothing stable, nothing unchanging in nature, either in the heavens or
on the earth. God alone, and rightly alone, is wholly full and perfect
in Himself, of Himself, and around Himself. He is His own firm
stability, nor can He be moved by any impulsion, since all things are in
Him, and He alone is all. Unless, indeed, we should dare to say, that
His movement is in eternity, but this eternity itself is motionless,
since all the motion of time revolves in eternity and takes its form
therein. God, then, has ever been and is for ever immutable; with Him
likewise is the immutable eternity, bearing within it, as

\[the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

the image of God, the uncreated universe not yet manifest. Hence, the
created universe constitutes the imitation of this eternal universe.
Time, despite its perpetual movement, possesses, by means of its
necessary revolutions on itself, the force and nature of stability.
Thus, although eternity is fixed and immutable, nevertheless, since the
motion of time unfolds itself in eternity, and this mobility is the very
condition of time, it appears that eternity, immutable in itself, yet
revolves by means of the time which is within it, and which contains all
motion. Thence it results that the stability of eternity appears mobile,
and the mobility of time, stable, by the fixed law of their course. And
thus it might seem even that God moves in His own immutability. For
there is in the immensity of the equilibrium an unchangeable movement;
the law of His immensity is unchangeable.

That, therefore, which is not subject to sense--the Infinite, the
Incomprehensible, the Immeasureable--can not be sustained, nor carried,
nor sought out; neither can we know whence it comes, whither it goes,
where it is, how it is, nor what it is. It is contained in its own
supreme stability, and its stability in it; whether God be in eternity,
or eternity in God, or both one and the other in the two. Eternity is
undefinable by time; and time, which may be defined by number, by
alternative, or by periodical revolutions, is eternal. Thus both appear
equally infinite and eternal. Stability being the fixed point which
serves as the basis of Movement, must, because of this stability, hold
the principal place. God and Eternity are, therefore, the principle of
all things; but the world, which is mutable, cannot be considered the
principle. The mutability of the world takes precedence of its
stability, by means of the law of eternal movement

\[in

in equilibrium. The whole consciousness of Divinity is then immutable,
and moves only in equilibrium; it is holy, incorruptible, eternal; or to
define it better, it is eternity, consisting in the very truth of the
Supreme God, the plenitude of all feeling and knowledge, or indeed, so
to speak, in God Himself. The consciousness of the natural universe
includes all sensible things and species; the consciousness of humanity
involves memory, by which man remembers his acts performed.

Now, the consciousness of Divinity descends even to the human creature.
God has not seen fit to extend to all beings this supreme and divine
consciousness, lest, were it common to all animals, the glory of it
should be diminished. The intelligence of the human mind,--whatever may
be its quality and quantity,--lies wholly in the memory, and it is by
means of this tenacity of memory that man has become the lord of the
earth. The intelligence of nature, the quality and consciousness of the
universe, may be understood by means of the sensible things it contains.
Eternity, in the next place, is understood as to its consciousness and
its quality, according to the sensible world.

But the intelligence of the Divine Being, the consciousness of the
Supreme God, is the only truth, and this truth cannot be
discovered,--no, nor so much as its shadow,--in this world full of
illusion, of changeful appearances, and of error, where things are known
only in the dimension of time.

Thou seest, O Asclepios, what lofty matters we dare to treat! I thank
Thee, O most high God, Who hast illumined me with the light of Thy
Grace! As for you, O Tat, Asclepios, and Ammon, keep these Divine
mysteries in the secret place of your hearts,

\[and

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

and conceal them in silence. Intellect differs from perception in
this--that intellect, by means of study, is competent to understand and
to know the nature of the universe.

The intellect of the universe penetrates to the consciousness of
eternity, and of the super-mundane Gods. And as for us who are men, we
perceive heavenly things as it were darkly through a mist, for thus only
does the condition of our human sense

permit us to behold them. Feeble, indeed, is our strength to penetrate
things so Divine; but, when at last we attain to them, we are indeed
blessed by the joy of our inward consciousness.
