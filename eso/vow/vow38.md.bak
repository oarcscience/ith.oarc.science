### PART III.

THE soul is, then, an incorporeal essence, and even when she is in a
body, she does not wholly lose her manner of being. Her essence is that
of perpetual movement, the spontaneous movement of thought; yet is she
not moved in any thing else, nor towards any thing else, nor for any
thing else. For she is a primordial force, and that which is primal
needs not that which is secondary. The expression "in any thing" is
applicable to place, to time, to

\[nature;

nature; "towards any thing" is applicable to a harmony, to a form, to a
figure; "for any thing" is applicable to the body, because time, place,
nature, and form are related to the body. All these terms are conjoined
by reciprocal bonds. The body requires place, for it is not possible to
conceive of a body unless also of a place occupied by it; a body changes
its nature, such change is not possible unless in time, and by means of
movement in nature; nor can the component parts of a body be united
unless by harmony of form. Space exists on account of corporeity, it
contains the changes thereof and suffers it not to be annihilated in
these changes. The body passes from one condition to another, but in
quitting its first condition it ceases not to be body, it takes only
another condition. It was body, it remains body, its state alone varies;
wherefore, that which changes in corporeity is quality and mode of
being. Place, time, and natural movement, themselves bodiless, have each
their special property. The property of space is to contain; the
property of time is interval and number; the property of nature is
movement; the property of harmony is affinity; the property of body is
change; the property of soul is thought.
