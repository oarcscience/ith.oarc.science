### PART VI.

THE soul is, then, an eternal and intelligent essence; having for
thought her own reason. She enters into association with the concept of
harmony. Separated from the physical body, she endures in herself, she
is independent in the Ideal world. She controls her reason, and confers
on the entity emerging into life a movement analogous to her own
thought, that is being; for the property of the soul is to assimilate
other things to her own character. There are two kinds of vital
movement: the one conform-able to the essence of the soul, the other to
the nature of the body. The first is general, the second particular; the
first is independent, the second is subject to necessity. For everything
moved is subject to the necessary law of the mover. But the motor
movement is united by affinity to the intelligent principle. It behoves
the soul to be incorporeal, and to be essentially different from the
physical body, for if she had a body she would have neither reason nor
thought. All bodies are unintelligent, but in receiving the spirit they
become animated and breathe. The breath belongs to the body, but reason
contemplates the beauty of the essential. The sensible spirit discerns
appearances. It is distributed into organic sensations; mental
perception is a part of it, as also is the acoustic, olfactive,
gustative, and tactile sense. This spirit, attracted by thought,
discerns sensations, otherwise it creates only phantoms, for it belongs
to the body, and receives all things. The reason of the essential is the
judgment. To the reason belongs the cognizance of lofty things; but to
the sensible spirit, opinion. This last receives its energy from the
external world; but the former from within itself.
