### PART I.

THERE are, then, essential spirit, reason, intelligence, perception.
Opinion and sensation tend towards perception, reason towards the
essential spirit; thought advances independently. Thought is associated
with perception. Conjoined, all these become a single form, which is
that of the soul. Opinion and sensation tend also towards perfection,
but they do not continue in the same condition, they exhibit excess,
failure, or variation. Separated from perception, they deteriorate;
approximating to and following it, they participate in the intellectual
reason through the sciences. We have the power of choice; it depends on
us to choose either the best or the worst by our will. The choice of
evil approximates us to the corporeal nature, and subjects us

\[to

to Destiny. The intellectual spirit which is in us, being free, the
intellectual reason is free also, always identical with itself, and
independent of Destiny. Therefore, in following this higher and
intelligent reason, ordained by the supreme God, the spirit is superior
to the order of Nature over creatures; but the soul which attaches
herself to these creatures participates in their destiny, though foreign
to their nature. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_51"></span>[150:1](vow42.htm#fr_51) In the above fragment
the power of the human will is clearly asserted as the only instrument
by which Destiny may be controlled. By continued and ardent striving
towards the purely spiritual and intelligent, the soul frees herself
from the power of Destiny (Karma), and at length passes into beatitude.
She transcends natural order, and enters into the divine. This is
Saintship. Inversely, by attaching herself to sensible things, and by
suffering herself to be borne away by passion and desire towards
illusory existence, she becomes caught on the ever-rolling wheel of
Destiny, and made subject to the order of Nature, which is that of
Metamorphosis. Whereas her true duty and happiness are to aspire
continually upwards, addressing herself by means of purified passion and
desire towards the One, and away from the Manifold.
