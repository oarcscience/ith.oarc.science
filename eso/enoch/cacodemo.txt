	The enochian system is primarily angelic in character. There are
no entities in the system who actually meet the traditional defini-
tions of elementals or demons. All the elemental forces are invoked
and used through the intervention of conscious, intelligent entities
who are themselves of a multiplex nature. These entities can provide
elementals for the magician, but the elementals can not be directly
invoked. 

	The closest one can come to directly invoking an elemental in
this system is in the invocation of the so-called "cacodemons" (Dee's
appellation) or "minimal sapient entities" (my appellation). I use
this name for them because they are the least complicated beings in
the system that are capable of responding to their environment and
maintaining an independent existence. They are composed of two forces
of opposite polarity, bound together by one additional letter from the
Tablet of Union. Thus they have one force for each of the three
necessary aspects, sulphur, salt, and mercury.

	The following excerpt provides a description of the process of
invoking these cacodemons in the Temple. It was provided in an astral
contact with Atapa, Sephirotic Angel of the Fiery Lesser Angle of the
Water Tablet. 

	These instructions should not be interpreted rigidly. There are
numerous minor variations, particularly in the method of forming the
names. The flexibility of the Enochian system is such that all of them
will produce results, varying slightly with the method used. 

	"The threads of my garment are of course the so-called "caco-
demons" of the sub-angle, made out of the forces of the kerubic and
servient squares. They seem at times to be demons, but only when their
force is allowed to manifest unconstrained. Like animals in your own
world, they are full of emotion, but do not have any sense. Therefore,
we higher types such as myself and the other angels of the crosses
must be strong gods to them, leading them both gently and firmly, as
one would lead a loyal but temperamental dog.

	"In your work with these demons, do not be afraid to treat them
roughly, for it is all that they understand, until you have trained
them in a new way. 
	"Now when Dee made the tablets to appear in the world, he said
that only the first two letters of the kerubic and servient names
could be made into cacodemons. But in truth, the angelic [kerubic]
squares and servient squares can all be used in such demons, provided
that the square is united with one which is right next to it in the
temple of the tablet. Thus, there are four possible cacodemons in
every kerubic angels's domain, since in the pillars there are four
pairs of squares that share an edge. [Similarly for the rows making up
the altars -- B.R.]

	"Now, in the invocation of the cacodemons, ye must form their
names in one of two ways. The first only may ye use for the cacodemons
of the Kerubic squares. This first or the second may be used with the
squares of the servants.

	"For all the squares, ye may take any two letters whose squares
have a connecting edge in the pillar or the altar. Take ye not the
diagonal forces, for they are of the same polarity, and would not be
well balanced. (Thus also for letters from different rows of the
altar.) Prefix these with the letter of spirit from the element's line
in the Tablet of Union, and thus ye have the names of the cacodemons.

	"For example, in my own quarter, the Kerubic squares are NLRX.
This would give cacodemons HNL, HLR, HRX,HXN. The letter from the
tablet of union always represents the balanced spirit in the entity.
The second and third letters are male or female according to the
polarity of their sub-energy in its attribution to IHVH. In HNL, N is
(Earth of (Fire of Water)), and is thus female. L is (Air of (Fire of
Water)), and thus male. So also for any Kerubic cacodemon. 

	"In the servient squares, the female- or male-ness of a square is
according to the kerubic letter governing its column position. 

	"In forming the names of the cacodemons of the servient squares,
a second method can be used. This is to take the letter from the
element's name in the Tablet of Union that is attributed to the
element governing the row from which the names are being derived.
Thus, the top servient row in my quarter, attributed to fire, would
form the names thus: AXP, APC, ACN, ANX. Or, using the letter of
Spirit: HXP, HPC, HCN, HNX.  

	"The latter form is better for works of a spiritual or internal
nature. The former are better for works intended to manifest in the
outside world. A letter from the Tablet of Union must be used in every
demon's name. For the forces of the two squares from the Elemental
Tablet will not hold together without the light of this third. There
is no harm in trying, but the forces will instantly dissipate again
when the magician relaxes his will.

	"Also, the second and third letters may be switched in their
places, to emphasize one or the other of the demon's forces.

	"Now, when invoking a cacodemon in the Temple built from the
Tablet, stand in the center of the Temple, where the light of the
Solar King of the Tablet comes down in a beam of radiance from above.
Face the altar that contains the letters of the demon in question. 
Perform the invocation of Spirit using the first key, and not the
second key. Invoke the elemental name from the Tablet of Union. Call
upon that god to fill your temple with radiance. Also state the
purpose of your invocation at this point, in a short form.

	"Next, recite the call of the Element, and invoke the Holy Names
of the tablet down through the level of the Seniors. Then recite the
calls of the sub-element, whether or not this be the same as the call
of the Element of the Working. Then invoke the names of the gods and
angels of the sub-element. For the kerubic names, add the letter from
the Tablet of Union, if the work be one of raising oneself in the
spirit, or bringing down the spirit. Use no additional letter if the
work be one of expression in the levels of matter.

	"Then invoke the angel governing the line within which the demon
lives, using a letter from the tablet of union or not, along the same
rule as the kerubic squares. Finally, invoke the cacodemon itself.

	"Its visible appearance, whether manifest in the temple or only
in the vision, should reflect the attributions of the squares from
which it is formed. The first letter will determine the form of the
head. The second will determine the form of the arms and upper torso,
and the third letter will determine the lower torso and legs. Thus
some truly odd looking entities can be seen in this process.

	"For works of an internal nature, to strengthen or counter some
aspect of the personality, a glyph or visual symbol embodying the
desired outcome should be prepared ahead of time in the imagination,
and rehearsed until it can be held in the mind with ease. 

	"When the demon is evoked to visible appearance in the astral
temple, he appears above the altar from which his forces come. Often
one of the strands of the light-fountain will straighten and he will
appear out of it. He is bound to the altar both by his own origins,
and by the light of the central square of the Sephirotic cross of the
quarter, which is directly above his head. He may not leave this place
without permission, nor may he cause any harm to the magician while so
bound. 

	"If the magician wishes to direct the demon to the aid of his
work, he will present the symbols of the work to the demon, and state
his will clearly. Then he should charge the demon to put his force
into the symbol of the work, and to cause that work to be accomplished
through the forces he represents. 

	"Be advised that the demons may do their work in a manner that is
offensive to "community standards of conduct". The magician should not
allow himself to become emotionally involved through such offense. He
must always consider himself to be superior to such creatures, and
consider that it is doing his will within the limits of its abilities.

	"For example, a cacodemon might choose to transfer his three
aspects to the symbol of the work by spitting on it, then copulating
with it, then defecating on it. Think not that it intends any dis-
respect by this. It barely has enough intelligence to be conscious,
and there is none left over for cleverness. Think of it thus, as a
particularly stupid animal, which must be dealt with firmly, but
without trying to change its instinctive nature.

	"No such creature has secrets of any importance. They are merely
bundles of elemental forces. If they speak, the great likelihood is
that they echo the unconscious will of the magician, and speak not of
their own will (of which they have none). 

	"For a working intended to be effective outside of the person, in
the manifest world, a physical talisman should be made. These can be
out of papyrus, or compressed and smoothed sheepskin, or out of cedar
or other wood. If made out of wood, its height should be one-quarter
its diameter.

	"The talisman should show on its back side the enochian sigil of
the Element of the Working in the center, surrounded by four sigils
showing the sub-elements of the tablet, with the sub-element of the
working at the top. And all bound together by a circle around the rim
of the talisman.

	"On the front side should be written in Enochian or English
characters the names of all the gods and angels of the hierarchy above
the cacodemon.  The name of the Elemental God and King should be
centered, with the names of the seniors placed around the rim. The
names of the Calvary Cross of the sub-element should be placed above
the names of God and King, and formed into their cross. The names of
the Kerubic angel, lesser angel, and cacodemon should be placed below
the King-name. The symbol of the working should be placed to the left
of the name of the cacodemon, or directly above it, since we are
shaping him to do the work. [The Three Names and the King's name
should be written twice as large as the other names. -- B.R.]

	"When the demon is evoked for outward purpose, and comes to
visible appearance within the temple, then the talisman is raised in
the physical hands, while its astral counterpart is raised and placed
on the altar from which the demon comes. The magician initiates a
vortex around the edge of the talisman, and charges the demon to
become one with the vortex and follow it down into the talisman. If
necessary, the force of the Sephirotic cross can be brought down from
its place in the ceiling to force the demon into the talisman. When
the demon does this and the vortex is absorbed into the talisman, then
a gesture of sealing should be done over it, binding the demon inside
it until released. Cover the physical talisman with a white cloth to
protect it from dust, but leave it out in the parts of your home or
workplace you use in your daily life, so that it may connect itself to
the threads which are the means by which the work will be accomp-
lished."
