A vision of the Square "T" of ISMT of the Fiery Lesser
Angle of the Earth Tablet.

Begun 11/11/85, 11:11 am.

I had determined to do an exploration of a square of an Enochian tablet 
following the directions and system described by Regardie in The Golden 
Dawn. I selected a square from the Earth tablet, "T" or "M"1, the rightmost 
kerubic square of the Fiery Lesser Angle. 

I derived the appropriate divine names for invoking the square, and 
constructed the pyramid in the imagination. The north side and top 
colored black, the other three visible sides colored red. I imagined the 
kerub being hidden within the pyramid, and a ray of light descending to or 
ascending from the pyramid.2

I performed the sign of the Enterer, and went into the pyramid. As this 
happened, the sides attributed to Fire changed from red to the flashing 
color, green. On the inside, the walls changed from green to red. I saw the 
sphinx of the sub-element, which had the head of a bull and the body, 
legs, and tail of the male lion. I gave the 5=6 signs, and tested him with 
the letters, at which he seemed to expand while maintaining shape. This 
indicated he was genuine.

I invited the sphinx to take me to a place where I could see the effect of 
this square in nature. Immediately we went to a place far underground, 
where a river of fire was being constricted and pushed back by a wall or 
barrier of rock. It seemed to be as if the fire was sealed off in a round 
space entirely surrounded by cold rock. I was told that the effect of the 
square had to do with the encapsulation of a force, all-potent within its 
own sphere of action, by a slower force acting on a larger scale. The wall 
of rock could be seen to move very slowly, forcing the fire into a smaller 
space.

An example was shown. We went to the western edge of the United 
States, and to the subduction zone where the edge of the Pacific tectonic 
plate was forced down underneath the edge of the continent. Despite its 
great melting heat, the molten rock of the mantle is pushed back down by 
the edge of the plate.

As another example I was taken to a Kimberlite pipe in Africa. These 
"pipes" are the cooled remains from an action like that of the square. The 
hot material had been cut off from the mantle and forced close to the 
surface by immense pressure from the surrounding rock. The combination 
of heat and pressure caused the formation of carbon crystals, diamonds, 
in the pipe.

I asked to see the spiritual animal of the square. Only gnomes were 
shown. The gnomes all had stubby arms and legs, and heads elongated 
from front to back until they were almost football-shaped. The short limbs 
and the shape of the head allowed them to move very quickly (in a 
horizontal position) along very small tunnels in the rock. They appeared to 
be strong.

I vibrated the name of the god of the square, Horus. (He is god because 
the square has three fiery sides, despite being in the tablet of Earth). 
Horus appeared, and I gave him the 5=6 signs. He responded with the 
same signs, then added the signs of 1=10 and 4=7. I judged this to be 
reasonable since these are the signs of earth and fire, represented by this 
square.

Horus showed me the sphinx of the square again, but his varied from 
mine in that the head was that of a buffalo with a fringe of hair along the 
jaw-line. The body was more elongated than the sphinx who guided me, 
like a cheetah, and of a reddish-orange color. The head was black that 
turned a dark glowing green, like the shine on beetle's wings, where it was 
highlighted.3

Horus said: "Bemoan me, o worshiper, for though I am truly the god of 
this pyramid, yet my own powers have come to naught in this place. The 
fire is ever smothered by the greater earth, and here my force and fire are 
leached from me."

He appeared to have nothing more to say, so I requested to see the type 
of man represented by the square. I was shown a large, thick-headed 
man with a square brow and dark hair. His body was like that of a 
wrestler, or like that of the God Mars, and he wore nothing but a loincloth. 
The skin was colored dark brown, but the features were caucasian. I got 
the impression that this man was stolid and determined, and that he got 
his way in life by forcing himself into the position he wanted, and then 
refusing to move from it until everyone else accepted the fait accompli. He 
is lacking in any really demonstrative characteristics, but has the slow but 
unremitting force of a glacier.

In the plant kingdom, this square controls the lives of seeds buried in 
permafrost or hard ground, and also the way in which roots of plants force 
their way into tiny cracks in rock.

In the animal kingdom, the force was shown me in those mammals that 
bury themselves for the winter, and in insects that store their eggs in 
underground capsules while they hatch.

I asked to see the effect in human society, and was shown a group of 
persons entering a cave for purposes of worship. They did so because the 
ground insulated them from the influences of other living things, allowing 
them to concentrate an unusually large amount of pure god-force without 
having it leak away. 

In the human arts, the square relates to the use of pigments produced by 
burning or roasting certain minerals.

On a cosmic scale, the square shares with others the responsibility for the 
formation of a cold crust on molten, recently-formed planets.
 
It was pointed out to me that the entire column of squares governed by 
this square also had a part to play in the details of the processed 
described. At this point, I felt I was getting tired, so I ended the vision and 
returned to my body.

I closed the temple by banishing the forces.

A Vision of the Square "M" of of ISMT of the Fiery
 Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.

Begun 11/13/85, 9:15 pm.

This square is the one immediately to the left of the square used in the 
above vision. While still in the fiery sub-element of the Earth Tablet, its 
north, south, east, and west sides are attributed to Earth, Fire, Scorpio, 
and the Queen of Wands, respectively. There are still two parts fire in the 
square, but one of the previous fire sides has turned to water. It also is 
attributed to Heh of IHVH.

I visualized the pyramid of the square standing in the middle of my astral 
temple. As I did so, the temple darkened, and the pyramid became more 
clearly visible. The top was black with the letter Tal (M) in white. The north 
side had the four-color Enochian emblem of Earth on a black background. 
The east became dark blue with the Eagle kerub in orange-yellow. On the 
south, the simple triangle of fire in red. The west side showed Crowley's 
version of the Queen of Wands, the fiercely imperious woman and her 
leopard mascot. 4

The fiery sides of the pyramid flashed from red to green to red again. I 
gave the sign of the Enterer and passed into the pyramid, giving the sign 
of Silence when centered in it. 

The sphinx was there. It had the head of a wild ox or buffalo, the 
forequarters of the Lion, the hindquarters of the Eagle, and the tail of the 
lion.5 Given the 5=6 sign, it responded with the same signs, and added 
the signs of Earth and Water6. The sphinx stood up on its hind legs and 
leaped up into the beam emanating from the top of the pyramid. I 
sounded the divine names of the square again, and followed the sphinx 
up through the beam.

I rose up the planes for a while without encountering any cohesive 
images. Suddenly I came out into a dark scene. The background of the 
scene consisted of a mountain range, beginning out of sight to my right, 
and continuing south for some miles before turning east. After crossing to 
the east, the range tapered down to a promontory. This tongue of land 
stuck out into a dark sea that filled the rest of the east. From behind the 
mountains to the south rose clouds, covering the sky. 

In front of the mountains, an inlet of the sea protruded across the picture, 
up to the base of the western mountains. The water was a very dark 
grayish-brown, with an oily sheen to the surface. 

The foreground of the scene was a hard, cold rock shelf or shield, with 
nothing growing on it. When I turned around, the scene to the north simply 
faded into blackness. The ground had a slick feel to it.

I went forward to examine the water. It was no more clear from close up, 
although I could see that most of its opacity came from suspended 
particles. The particles looked almost like silver metalflake paint. The 
surface of the water was slightly convex where it touched the shore, 
becoming higher the farther you went from shore.

I was invited to stick my hand in the water. I did so quickly and pulled it 
out again. I could see the oiliness and a thin coating of the metalflakes on 
my hand. Then the flesh all dissolved, leaving the bare bones. This 
dissolving continued on up the arm until I shook it, after which the flesh 
came back. I either thought, or heard someone say, "The Waters of 
Death".

Looking to the west, I tried to see what was at the end of the inlet. The 
shore could not be seen due to clouds of steam or mist. But farther up the 
cliff, there seemed to be drops of glowing orange liquid seeping or 
sweating through the rock. When I tried to see more detail, that area of 
the scene dimmed.

I then noted that there was a glow reflecting from the clouds to the south. 
The source of light seemed to be behind the mountains. I rose up until I 
could see what was there. To the west and south appeared a great sea of 
fire, orange-red. In the western area, the fire moved in visible currents. To 
the south, it was a flaming field.

Where the fire met the water in the east, great billows of steam arose, to 
become the clouds visible from the north. The two elements completely 
balanced each other, so that there was always just enough water flowing 
south to stop the fire from getting to the north and east. They met at an 
unwavering line that stretched to the horizon.

Moving back above the mountains, I examined the fire more closely. 
There was an impression that the fire was under great pressure to cross 
the mountains into the north. It rose up in waves, higher and higher into 
the sky, but there seemed to be an invisible barrier above the mountains, 
and it could not pass them. It fell back.

I asked to see the animal related to the square, and was shown a sort of 
were-creature in the process of changing from a large fish to a bull. The 
front half had the torso and head of the minotaur, and the bottom half was 
the rear half of a fish. The fire aspect seemed completely absent, until I 
noticed or was told that the fire was the transformation itself. 

It was then pointed out that the animal was frozen in the middle of its 
transformation, and that this "freezing" was a function of the power of the 
square. I gathered that it controlled the retention of neonatal 
characteristics in otherwise mature organisms. The human retention of 
the relative hairlessness of the newborn is an example of this. It also 
controls cases in which a species that goes through metamorphoses as 
part of the maturation process begins to stop itself at some point before 
the final metamorphosis occurs. No species was given for this second 
effect.

I asked to see the power of the square as it acted in the mineral kingdom. 
I was shown a place in the Pacific Trench, very deep, where lava flowed 
out of a vent in the side of the trench. The pressure is so great that the 
water does not explode when the hot lava hits it. Only a thin layer of 
steam is produced between them, and the water carries off the heat from 
the steam, cooling the lava and stopping its advance.

For an example of this force in the plant kingdom, I was shown a 
microscopic view of the pistil of a flower. The pistil was a long stem full of 
microscopic tubules. As I watched, a grain of pollen came down one 
tubule and united with an egg cell. Behind this first grain, more grains tried 
to come down the tube, but the tube was closed off by being filled with 
sap before they could get close to the egg. This closing of the passage is 
the function of the square's force. In the human being, a similar process 
goes on when the fertilized egg grows a thick outer membrane 
immediately after the first sperm cell enters it.

The type of person represented by the square was a woman, with a body 
that appeared wide when viewed from the front or back, but looked thin 
from the side. The upper face was square, with a triangular jaw line. The 
hair was dark brown with blonde highlights. The skin was also tanned 
dark. Her dress was an absurd collection of red and blue polka dots on a 
black base. I could not get a strong impression of the temperament of this 
person.

As an example of the force acting in human society, I was shown an 
image of two groups of people acting at cross-purposes. I got the 
impression that this was not interference of an active or willful type. 
Instead, the two groups blocked each other "by surprise", in ways that do 
not directly relate to the function of either. An ambulance having its route 
blocked by a Shriner's parade, for instance.

The vision seemed to be weakening at this point, so I returned to my 
temple and banished the forces. I then returned to my body.

---------------------------------------------------

The Square "S" of ISMT of the Fiery Lesser Angle
of the Earth Tablet.

Begun 11/16/85. 12:12 pm.

I vibrated the calls and the names, and visualized the pyramid. For a few 
moments, I got an image of rapidly blowing air, the movement being 
generated by heat from fires below. However, the heat did not reach up to 
the level where I was, which was cool.

Above me I saw the sphere of the earth looming down towards me, but 
the sense of gravity was pulling towards the fire and not the earth. There 
was an impression of many angels or beings flashing by me, but I could 
not see them clearly, only a silvery-white or yellow blur. It seemed that 
they were moving too fast to see. But some of them would stop for just a 
split-second to look at me, and by the time the images of them registered, 
they would be gone again. 

The "afterimages" from these brief stops let me see that they were 
wearing diaphanous white or yellow gowns, much like the usual T-cross 
magician's robe, but with two or three additional layers of sheer cloth that 
blew in the wind. They seemed to have dark faces with blonde hair, and a 
sharp but delicate bone structure.  The eyes were wide, dark, and serious.

At the time I did not consciously see more than this. The last thing I recall 
hearing was a voice saying "What the force of the square "T" conceals 
and encysts, here I disperse." 

I couldn't seem to get a clearer picture, or to get another image, so I 
returned to my body, thinking that the attempt had failed, and that it would 
have to be done over again. Yet there was sense of things unfinished. I 
felt restless. The body wanted to move around and do something active. 
My mind felt relaxed and free of pressures, but unable to focus, or to 
produce the idea for something to do.  And despite this feeling, there was 
a pressure on the top of the head that was giving me a tension headache. 
(All this obviously relates to the forces of the pyramid. Fire at the bottom, 
air in the middle, and earth at the top.)

Sometimes such feelings indicate that there is a message to be passed to 
me by automatic writing. I had learned this talent early, and had 
developed it to the point where it was actually automatic typing using my 
word-processor, often at faster speed than I can type consciously.

I sat down at the processor, and got just a little bit of message. The being 
identified himself as NSITM, the archangel ruling this square of the tablet. 
He said that he had come to tell me all about the kerubic squares of this 
lesser angle. He began an introductory sentence, and then the sense of 
contact was cut off completely. There was no impression that the 
intelligence was still around.

The restless feelings reappeared. I did a banishing, hoping this would at 
least tone down the power of it. In spite of the banishings, this feeling of 
the power of the square continued for most of the day. I felt both mentally 
dispersed and physically restless until evening, when an additional 
banishing caused them to cease. 

But in writing this down the next day, I found that I remembered a great 
deal more than I had seen at the time. The events described below were 
not consciously experienced, but in writing this account they appeared to 
me as a memory of an event that had actually happened. I can not 
distinguish it from the memory of other visions that I did have consciously. 
The only thing that convinces me now that I did not see it consciously is 
my memory of doing other things at the time, and being totally unaware of 
such a vision occurring. Apparently the vision continued at some level of 
my mind without my attention.

After the fact, I recall seeing a picture of a great white cliff. The ground 
extending back from the top of the cliff was black. Along the face of this 
cliff, a large number of angels worked, hurriedly bringing things, and 
taking things away. I could not see clearly what they brought7, but it went 
into the cliff face and was buried in the earth. The angels took away great 
pieces of the cliff itself, which looked crystalline from a closer viewpoint. 
These pieces they scattered about the surface of the earth, producing life 
in great variety. Everywhere a piece fell, new life arose into being. Each 
new life was actually a whole planet somewhere in the cosmos, with its 
entire systems of animals, plants and intelligent beings.

And an angel said to me: "The cycle of life in the earth is controlled by 
these squares of the lesser angle of fire, in the Wall of Earth. First, in the 
square "T", is the life injected into the potential of being by the will of the 
gods. It takes on the quality of earth, and therefore does its flashing 
brightness bemoan its loss of self. But without its loss, the earth were 
mere dead matter, inert and without possibility of form. 

"In the square "M" is the life spread throughout the earth. Where the fires 
of "T" were encapsulated as it were, so the waters of "M" do leach the life 
from its capsule, and spread it throughout the base-matter, making it living 
and receptive to the thoughts of the gods. Under the pressure from the 
earth above, this life-infested matter changes to a crystalline form. Each 
unit of crystal possesses the full capabilities of the original life-impulse, 
with the added ability to produce more life-crystals without loss to itself."8

(I noted in passing that while the individual units had a crystalline form, 
they did appear to have some inherent flexibility. There was also a vitality 
to them, an impression that one body was not enough to hold their force. 
They were ready to multiply at any instant. When the crystals were in 
groups, they bunched together in a way that reminded me of muscle 
fibers, so that individual crystals could slide around a bit without losing 
place in the group.)

I asked the angel why my vision of the square "M" had not revealed this. 
The angel replied that it did, but that I had misinterpreted what I saw. The 
drops of glowing fire on the cliff face of that vision were the encapsulated 
lives of the square "T". They fell into the waters, where they were 
dispersed and distributed throughout the earth. The metallic flakes in the 
water were the dissolved lives of "T". The waters were called the "Waters 
of Death", both because of the Scorpio connection and because to the 
lives it did indeed appear as a form of death, that is, a disruption of their 
unity. The steam of the meeting of fire and water in that vision produced 
the air in which the angel and I were presently standing. The fact that the 
square "M" was a transitional form accounted for the were-creature and 
the other references to retained characteristics.

He also mentioned that if I had used the main attributes, I would have 
seen the flakes of life come out of the water greatly expanded. Each 
would have been equal to the original drops of fire, and be blown 
westward into the square "S". Thus the life multiplied itself out of the 
energy of matter. I would also have seen that they emerged from their 
bath with an aspect of hardness and sharpness that they did not have 
before. The waters are the waters of the Styx, and they are armored like 
Achilles from the water's touch. But having been bathed fully, they have 
known Death and will no longer feel the touch of his arrow.

The angel continued: "These processes are ever continuous, so that the 
crystals of life must be moved from their place, to make way for yet more 
life. Here in the square "S", we take the encapsulated lives of the square 
"T", and place them in the richest parts of the earth. In return, we take the 
crystals of life that are extruded from the cliff face, and we scatter them 
across the universe, so that the gods will have many canvasses upon 
which to work their art."

The angel showed me the scattering of the life-crystals. The material 
universe is seen as a great plane of energy from this square. It is in fact 
the field of flames that caused the air to move at the beginning of the 
vision. This energy in great abundance is everywhere ideal for the 
seeding of life, for it can do nothing of itself, but must have the impulse of 
life to bring it into form. 

Within the field, there are stresses that dictate that life take one form or 
another in order to move there. Incompatible forms are destroyed quickly, 
because they can not assimilate the kinds of energy available. I saw the 
angels take the life-crystal lumps they carried, and cut them into pieces 
that matched the stresses in a particular area. Then they would place the 
pieces carefully, so that the lines of stress in the area were aligned with 
the striations of the crystals. Leftover pieces were shaped to fill the 
stressed area to its full limits. The angel told me that this activity caused 
all the niches in the ecology to be filled with appropriate life.

Each piece so placed began to radiate like a sun, even brighter than the 
fires in which it lay. The light increased as the fires themselves began to 
take on the pattern and radiance of the crystals. It was said: "Thus does 
life create order, out of the chaos of universal energy. Through its very 
existence, it demands that the energy of the material world take on orderly 
forms. Not only within the limits of its own area, but extending by its 
radiance to other areas that have no life of their own. Its living beings 
become gods, and the agents of gods, making the creation in matter."

Without pause, the angel went on: "In coming to these squares, you 
sought knowledge of the enochian worlds, and of the powers thereof. We 
have given you in full measure what we have here, and will give more as 
you explore the last of our squares,"I". That you have not seen all that is 
here is certain, for as you know no man will see even a fraction of the 
whole. Even the gods rejoice in such unknowing, for it allows the 
possibility of Discovery. Yet we have given, and will give to the extent of 
our natures. Such as you come rarely to this world, who seek solely for 
understanding and knowledge, and hope for power only over self. To you 
we may give all that we have, all that we know, all that we be. Let your will 
go forth to continue this search, and your reward will be as the heavens 
made manifest."9

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 

(The piece that follows occurred simultaneous with, but separate from, the 
Angel's speech in this vision. It is the same theme played in a different 
key. The ways in which they harmonize will be left, as they say, as an 
exercise for the reader.)


At the same time as the angel spoke, I saw the primordial universe, 
divided into light and dark. The light and dark were separated along a 
plane that extended to infinity. There was no way to understand the size 
of what I saw, as there was nothing else in the image to compare it with. 
The dark appeared to be a solid wall. There was no intermixture with the 
light.

I looked more closely at the wall, comparing it with the light in which I 
stood, and understood that it was not truly dark. The two sides were 
interchangeable. If I had been on the other side, that side would have 
looked light and this side dark. 

An angel at my side told me that the light and dark were energy and 
matter. Matter is energy turned inside out. The interface between light and 
dark was actually at the level of what would be Tiphereth when the 
universe was created. All of the matter of the lower planes belongs to the 
other side. He emphasized again that if I were on the other side the 
situation would look exactly the same, but with that side being in the light.

The light side, while clearly full of energy, was totally transparent. It had 
no characteristics of any kind that could be seen. 

Suddenly a stream of light shot down towards the wall from behind me. As 
it hit the wall and passed through it shattered into a multitude of small, 
independent and self-sustaining units of energy. 

These units drew a shell of matter around themselves, so that they could 
barely be seen. Their energy interpenetrated to the surface of the shell. 
Eventually all the energy gathered into the shell, leaving the center 
hollow. (I was told that the deepest point in matter reached by the 
descending beam was Malkuth of the Tree.) 

Matter tried to eject these shells, since they were a disturbance of its 
normal motion. It could not do so, but its attempts put a steady pressure 
on the shells. Forcing the shells into a smaller area caused their energy to 
be concentrated, bringing them to a higher state of awareness.

With this increased awareness, the lives withdrew some of their 
substance from the shell, and concentrated it in their centers. The 
concentration of energy caused a rotary field of some sort to be 
generated around each shell. The matter was seen to have an innate 
rotation that was exactly opposite to that of the unit's. This opposition of 
fields caused the pressure on the units to increase tremendously. Each 
unit was forced to concentrate more of its energy in its center to maintain 
its integrity. But at the same time, the interaction of the fields generated 
even more energy, so that the units could add all the new energy they 
needed.

This additional energy helped fill the center and support the shell against 
matter. But the pressure also increased, in a kind of feedback loop, so 
that one process encouraged the other, which in turn encouraged the first. 
The units of energy became steadily brighter and stronger within their 
shells. 

Eventually some of the units found they could discard their shells 
altogether, and maintain themselves against matter's pressure solely 
through their own energetic counterpressure. The frictional effects of the 
two fields continued to generate more energy within the units, allowing 
them to continue expanding.

Since the units were not imbedded too deeply in matter, some of them 
eventually expanded to the degree that their bubbles of counterpressure 
broke through the surface of matter and back out into the light. Their own 
pressure caused them to be blown out through the holes they made, and 
into the light. Most of them immediately withdrew back into matter, but 
with several such experiences they moved out permanently, while 
maintaining their connection with matter in order to keep generating the 
energy they needed to expand.

The area covered by their connections to matter expanded as they did. 
Eventually, both the units and their connections expanded until they were 
lost out of sight, and there was nothing to indicate that they had ever been 
there. But the entire visible area was now just a small area within one 
unit's connecting cord, so the appearance of emptiness was false.

A voice said: This is how the gods reproduce. All gods are positive, and 
therefore can not mate with each other and produce a new entity on their 
own level. So they follow the ancient way, and throw parts of themselves 
into matter, there to disintegrate into the motes you saw. It is essential 
that they go through matter, for this is their source of independent life and 
had this not been done, the extended energy would return to its god and 
meld with his being again. Reproduction would fail.

"These motes are the souls of those who became men and women. Both 
[sexes] are positive with respect to matter, and both have potential to 
become gods again. There is no difference between them. [The emphasis 
is the speaker's, not the scribe's.] Some break their shells early, giving joy 
to their parent. Others stay encysted until the end of the world, when they 
are drawn out of matter whether or not they wish."

(Somewhere in all the above, it was pointed out that an entity on the side 
of things that saw our matter as light and our light as matter, would see 
exactly the same process going on from his side. The sparks sent into 
their matter would appear in our world as energy shooting from Malkuth to 
Tiphereth, and then spending all their time trying to force their way back 
into Malkuth again. These entities are known to us as demons. Of course, 
the demons think we are the demons.)

The two visions merged at the point where the angel said "In coming to 
these squares. . .".

Square "I" of ISMT. Fiery Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.10

9:19 pm 11/17/85

Rehearsed the calls and the names, and visualized the pyramid. The 
pyramid for this square has north = earth, east = earth kerub = Taurus, 
west = earth of fire of earth = Princess of Wands, and south = fire.

I did not feel like I was getting much of response to the invocation. The 
pyramid was unclear, and would not focus despite repeated invocations, 
and the use of the letters and the pentagrams. 

I entered into the pyramid, and saw the sphinx. He had the head and 
upper body and legs of a bull, and the rear body and tail of a lion. But his 
front legs were actually arms, so that he looked a bit like a minotaur.

He responded in kind to the 5=6 signs, and added the 1=10 sign. The 
image was still weak and out of focus. I tried to ask him to take me to a 
place where I could see the power of the square, but the image kept 
fading in and out, and I could not get the point across. I heard a voice 
saying something about the "nature of the square", but I could not hear it 
clearly.

Since the session did not seem to be going well, I cut it off and returned to 
my astral temple. After closing the temple, I returned to my body and went 
to sleep.

(I concluded later that the vision failed because I had spent much of the 
afternoon considering the implications of the previous vision. I still had a 
residual "charge" from that vision that had to leak off before a new force 
could come in clearly.)

11/18/85

At work today, I began to get images related to the square, but they were 
still weak. There was also a sensation that some kind of written or spoken 
narrative was waiting for me to hear it or transcribe it. I wrote down a few 
things, and most of it seemed to relate more or less to this square, but it 
started to get into praises of my personal power as a magician. This type 
of message always makes me suspicious, since I had had cause to regret 
believing similar praise in the past.

The more coherent section of the notes began:

"I gave the 5=6 sign [to the sphinx] and he responded with the same and 
added the 1=10 and 4=7 signs. He said: 'Behold, O worshiper, you have 
reached the culmination of your journey. I have been formed to be your 
[untranslatable thought involving receptivity to creative impulses] and as 
my god are you worshiped in turn by all the elements.'"

"I questioned him about this comment but kept getting distracted by 
events in the office. From several repetitions on the sphinx's part, it 
seemed that he said 'You are now a creator in truth, and therefore you 
have rights of control over all the elements of the four Walls of Enoch. But 
I speaketh not of the Floor.'11 He seemed reluctant to say more.

"I asked the sphinx to show me a scene representative of the square. I 
saw a scene of great lushness, tropical, with the heat seeming to rise from 
the ground. We were in a field surrounded on three sides by jungle, 
thickest to the north as we faced, thinner on the left, and changing to 
savannah on the right. To the south, the savannah was burning steadily, 
without smoke but with fire covering everything from about 100 yards 
away to the horizon. Children or small sprites played in the thin jungle to 
the west. 

"The Bull led me through the trees to the north, to a clearing surrounded 
by hardwood trees. The soil of the clearing was rich and loamy, and 
looked as if it had just been turned for planting.

"The bull spoke and said that the earth was cleared, and ready for 
whatever impulse12 I chose to put into it. I asked what sort of impulse it 
had in mind, and why I should do such a thing. (A touch of paranoia 
inspired by his previous comments about my privileges.)

"He explained that as a creator, I had to demonstrate my creativity by 
putting a new thing into this world. My interpretation of Achad's cabala 
would be such a thing. If I wished such a creation to grow and continue to 
bear fruit, it must be planted as a fire in the earth.

"I asked if anything else could be planted there, and what sort of thing. He 
said that anything would do, so long as it came from my own mind. He 
had suggested my cabala as my most worthy creation. 

"I asked how to do it and was told to plant its image in the soil. I visualized 
Achad's version of the Tree of Life. With each path that I added, I tried to 
put in the flavor or quality that I associated with the essence of the path. 
With the Tree visualized as best I could, I concentrated the image in my 
ajna center, and then threw it out from myself to enlarge and stand above 
the soil.

"Saying, "May this Tree live forever, and cover all the earth with its glory.", 
I caused it to sink into the soil until it was gone from sight.

"The Bull rejoiced with a glad heart."

At this point, business in the office picked up, and I had to spend the rest 
of the day interviewing. I stuffed my notes away and forgot about it until 
evening. 

I did the invocations again beginning at 6:06 pm. I got a clear image of the 
pyramid, and also a clear image of the sphinx, who seemed decidedly 
bored with all these comings and goings. He nodded to me and gestured 
upwards with his nose. I tested him with the pentagram and letters, which 
seemed to strengthen him. But the vision did not seem to want to go any 
where. So I got up and transcribed the above account of the events up to 
date, and went to do a Tarot reading to see if it would shed any light on 
the matter.

The reading indicated specifically that it was my resistance to the praise in 
the vision that was keeping me from seeing it clearly, and that I should 
throw myself into it and let the resistance come after it was over, if it had 
to. The "Celtic Cross" spread was the one used, and in the position 
defining the querent, it indicated a man who was disappointed because 
what he had intended to be a simple teaching aid had ceased to be so. 
This was so close to the mark that I had to laugh.

While I was putting the cards away, I got an image of the Egyptian 
goddess who rules the square, Nepthys. She was wearing the Moon 
Crown, with black and white nemyss, collar, and tunic, and she had yellow 
skin.

She gestured to me and lead me into the forest to the north of the field in 
which we stood. I saw that it was the same field of this afternoon's vision, 
but that it was night now, and a new moon matching the real moon's 
phase was in the sky. Despite being just a sliver, the vision's moon put out 
enough light to see.

We traveled again to the clearing of the earlier visions. It looked the same 
as I approached it, but as soon as I entered, I was covered by a thick 
darkness, almost palpable. The faintest of red glows could be seen or felt 
within it. Growing nervous, I intended to call upon Nepthys, but the name 
that I called out was "Nuit!"13

Immediately the sky cleared and the darkness vanished. The first thing 
my eyes saw was the night sky, brilliant stars in blackness, seeming to 
loom down. I could feel that the sky was Nuit. A voice without words said 
"Yes, my child, I, the mother of all and the end of all, come upon you. The 
thick darkness that you saw, laced with faint red, is my special sign to you, 
with the feeling of my presence that it gives. You saw it once before when 
you emerged from the Tree [in The Beast and the Star]."

The sky loomed yet nearer, and in some way the dimensions twisted, so 
that the earth and myself interpenetrated with the field of stars. We 
seemed to be parsecs across, but at the same time we retained our 
normal small size on the cosmic scale.

I felt myself being drawn into the field of stars, changing my shape to the 
basic sphere, whose simple elegance rules in the macrocosm. My earthly 
self was partially shed, so that I was touched at a deeper level by the 
scene.

I noted that in some way the spirit of the earth had been drawn up with 
me, and was itself become as a star in that sky. She appeared first as I 
usually see her from space, blue and brown clothed in white, then I saw 
her on the astral level, shrouded in a cloud of noxious gases, only a few of 
which are material in nature. Then I saw her transformed, glowing brightly 
enough to outshine all else around her.  

(Throughout all this, I had simultaneously been seeing the earth as a 
planet and as a woman. In woman-phase, she appeared first as a mother 
about 25 years old, fully mature in body and young in outlook. The 
correspondence to the miasma-image was a woman who had been 
burdened with the karma of millions through no fault of her own. In her 
transformation, she shed the dark, murky stew of emotions in which she 
had been clothed, She appeared young and bright, but with a knowledge 
so deep that it had made her innocent again.  

I marveled at the beauty of this young woman, though I can not describe it 
at all now beyond saying that she seemed to be all things at once. And 
even more I marveled that I was connected to her in some way that made 
me feel married. On thinking about this, it seemed reasonable. Earth 
certainly knows at least as much about me as a wife does about her 
husband. And, reversing it, my own knowledge of her, so very much less, 
was about equal to the average husband's knowledge of his wife. The 
connection between us felt very good, with an undercurrent of love given 
unconditionally. Love fairly shone from her and blinded me until I turned 
away.)

Nuit said, again without words, "This shall regenerate the world, the little 
world my sister, my heart & my tongue, unto whom I send this kiss."14

I was then sent a burst of information, and it took a while to untangle it all. 

It was the success of myself and my fellow magicians that "regenerated" 
the world. Every time one human being became fully aware of his/her 
star-ness, it raised the spiritual level of the being that enlivened the earth 
as well. 

In incarnating as the earth, this being had deliberately cut herself off from 
communion with her fellows among the stars. She had voluntarily "entered 
a prison of the flesh" in order to set the conditions necessary for her own 
next initiation. In doing so, she had also made herself the garbage dump 
for all the negative emotional matter in this sector of space.  

Receiving all this emotional matter served dual purposes. In relation to the 
earth herself, it enabled her to perform a "service" for her "community", 
loosely speaking, while at the same time undergoing a trial necessary to 
her advancement. The act was a service because it gave certain other 
stellar beings in the neighborhood, notably the star Set (Sirius or Sothis), 
a clean environment in which to undergo his next initiation, and to perform 
certain other magickal tasks. 

Now, to get out of this condition, it is necessary for the earth to have a 
certain number of fully conscious beings living in her, who are aware of 
their place in the larger cosmos. When these beings throw their 
consciousness outside the earth's aura, they punch holes in the blanket of 
emotional matter surrounding the earth. These holes continue to expand 
so long as the person maintains some connection within the earth's 
sphere. Each hole allows energy and information from the outside to get 
back to the earth's Life. Thus, she gains strength she needs to disperse 
the cloud, and material of the proper grade for her own growth.

And since each adept's consciousness is reflected in her own, the 
increased vibrations of the adept's awareness also raises her own state of 
consciousness slightly, further helping her to regain her lost state.

When the needed number of adepts are fully linked into the outer 
universe, then the earth can use their paths as a route to send her whole 
awareness out. From outside the material aura of the planet, she can take 
direct action to disperse the emotional miasma, and those beings who live 
on earth because of it. With the Air again clear, then balance will be 
restored to the relations between the kingdoms on earth, and man will find 
his place as its caretaker.

Thus, the initiations of individuals do good to the earth simply by having 
happened. Their continued existence on earth continues the good, so 
long as their knowledge of their place as stars in the womb of Nuit also 
continues. They need do nothing else but pursue their own wills. This is 
why it is a lie that sacrifice is necessary to initiation, and a lie that the 
initiated have a duty to spread their knowledge. 

Nuit bent down and enveloped myself and the earth in an embrace that 
was inside us as well as about us. It definitely felt like a kiss despite 
enclosing us completely. Then I returned to the clearing where we started, 
and the earth spirit went back into her body.

I looked about the clearing and wondered if I should close the vision or 
continue. A voice told me to wait a moment. I took the opportunity to go to 
the bathroom. It had taken a while to sort out what that burst of 
information had in it, and it was now 8:10 pm. I am certain that I have 
forgotten a lot of what was in the burst. For a while, ideas had gone by so 
fast that they were replaced by another before the could be absorbed.

I returned to the clearing. It was still and quiet. The moon seemed to have 
gone lower in the western sky, and there was not as much light. What little 
there was faded quickly, leaving me again in full darkness.

I heard: "You have invoked the powers of the fire of earth. And as we 
have told you, we have given to you in full measure. For is not the being 
who is the life of Earth ultimately the true fire of earth? Did she not inject 
herself into the body of earth as in the square "T", cutting herself off from 
her kind in order to bring life to the world? And did not her life disperse 
throughout the earth, as in the square "M", feeding every living creature, 
maintaining order of types and functions among them? And did not you, 
her creature, under the pressure of her life, become transformed from an 
amorphous lump into a Star? And is this not the reward of all the adepts 
upon her? And did you not see yourself, a Star of fire15, married to her 
within my field? And is not the heart of your soul, your own creation, now 
buried in her to grow and reproduce? Thus ye have made her the Bride, 
and IHVH is fulfilled within the Fiery Lesser Angle." 

Abruptly, the vision ended, and all sense of connection was gone. I went 
and finished this account of the vision, which I end here at 10:10pm.
-----------------------------------------------------

Notes and comments: (1985)

When I started this series of astral visions, it was only with the thought of 
doing something interesting with some unexpected free time. Square "T" 
was picked on a moment's impulse. It was only after the vision that I 
thought about invoking the other squares in the series. 

The experience of the first vision brought to mind one of the things that 
has annoyed me about published accounts of the Enochian squares. That 
is, these accounts all seemed haphazard. Squares were picked at 
random, and no effort was made to show the squares in their relation to 
the rest of the Tablet. While this might be satisfactory for demonstrating 
astral projection techniques, it did not do justice to the complexity or 
quality of the system. I decided to do a series of projections for related 
squares of one of the Tablets. The one I had just done seemed an ideal 
starting point.

All the squares in this series are what is known as "kerubic" squares. 
There are four in each of the lesser angles of each tablet, and they direct 
the operations of the sixteen subservient squares of the Angle. Their 
position and function make them an embodiment of the overall powers of 
the Angle.

The formula of IHVH determines most of the attributions in the tablets. 
Each of the kerubic squares is related to one letter of IHVH, as their name 
implies. Since each Lesser Angle and each Tablet is also related to one of 
the letters, we have three levels of interaction with the name. So under 
this system, the square "T" represents Fire of Fire of Earth, square "M" is 
Water of Fire of Earth, and so on. This symbolism is fairly clear in the 
visions.

By the time I started on the square "M", I had a whole plan lined out for 
doing the visions, analyzing the symbolism, and showing the interrelations 
between them. Nothing more was expected of the visions than a more-or-
less formal presentation of symbolic correspondences, and their relation 
to everyday events and objects. This was all I had gotten out of the 
system up till then, and there seemed no reason to expect anything 
different. 

After the second vision, this was still my intent. But after the first of the 
invocations for the square "S", I began to get feelings that things were 
getting out of hand. There was an impression that someone had co-opted 
my little project and that I was no longer in control of it. This is to be 
expected when a higher force is invoked, but the Elemental Tablets had 
always seemed to relate to the forces operating in the mundane world, 
which are normally under the magician's control.

The manner in which the vision of square "S" occurred verified that 
something more than my own will was involved in creating the vision. 
First, much of it occurred without my normal consciousness being 
involved. It appears that my magickal self was isolated from my mundane 
persona for the vision, and the persona only remembered it after the fact. 
Second, the events of the vision occurred in a way that defies normal 
concepts of experiential time. Certain sections are remembered as having 
happened one at a time, and yet they are also remembered as happening 
simultaneously. I had experienced this effect before, but not in cases 
involving such a large amount of information.

The twisted-time effect was even more pronounced in square "I". The 
vision occurred in a way that was not at all serial. Instead, it appeared as 
a complete creation in four dimensions, and was only translated into a 
serial-time mode after the fact.

I would like to point out that the visions continued to follow the attributions 
of the squares invoked despite the change of approach and scope in the 
latter two visions. Beyond this, they speak for themselves. 

You may have noticed that the starting and stopping times of the visions 
include a large number of symmetric numbers. This was not deliberate. 
My unconscious is attracted to these numbers, and frequently arranges 
events in this way. There is no particular occult meaning involved.



11/22/85

While doing the hexagram ritual before going to bed last night, I had the 
vision described below, which was supplemented by additional data given 
the next day. It is written as one narrative.

I had been thinking about the multiple simultaneous presentations in the 
last two visions from the fiery lesser angle. 

I saw two of the visions as they were presented at the time, and saw the 
manner in which they paralleled each other in three or four dimensions. 
Suddenly I perceived that these were only two of an infinite number of 
possible presentations that could have been shown. There were 
additional visions parallel to the first two stretching off in every direction. 
As the visions got farther away, the images they presented changed, but 
the basic energy remained the same.

I had some thoughts about the characteristics of the astral plane that I can 
not recall now. Something about the plane being so protean or flexible 
that it would accurately reflect any force, but in a symbolic form. Also 
about how these multiple visions relate to the same force acting in 
different circumstances.

I saw that the energetic pattern of a particular square was infinitely sub-
dividable, with the same pattern appearing at whatever level of fineness 
one chose to look at it. But again, though the force was the same, the 
manifestation would differ.

The energies are in fact infinitely recursive. Smaller levels reflect patterns 
of larger levels, and vice versa. Like the way that gross shapes of crystals 
reflect the internal arrangement of their molecules. I saw that any 
particular vision of a square was like the viewpoint from a particular 
molecule within the crystal's matrix. The exact form of the vision is 
determined not only by the type of energy, but also by the vision's place 
within the matrix of all possible visions.

This confused me. Since the matrix is infinite, there should be no 
identifiable differences in the forces acting on any point within the matrix.

I was told that the matrix for any particular square was infinite. But the 
square interacted with the energies of all the other squares in ways that 
were not uniform from point to point. If the current square was "T" of the 
fiery lesser angle of earth, the energies of an adjacent square such as 
square "M" might appear at one point in "T" to come from an angle of 270 
degrees, while from a different point it might appear to come from 265 
degrees. As with astrology, the surround determines the effect at any 
point.

Later that night, I also saw a vision of the Tablets, connected in such a 
way that they formed the walls of a room. The tablet of spirit was the floor, 
and another unidentified tablet was the ceiling. It formed a square box 
with the squares of the tablets facing inward.

The viewpoint withdrew from the box thus made, and I saw that lines of 
light extended at right angles from each face of the box. The viewpoint 
retreated further, and I saw that the box was connected to six other 
boxes. Each of these was in turn connected to six boxes, and so on in a 
cubic matrix that extended into the distance on all sides.

I could see that each box was composed of Tablets as was my own, but 
that each box had a different arrangement of forces. Each box had only 
slight differences from the boxes connected to it. The differences between 
systems became greater as the distance between them in the matrix 
increased.

The changes from box to box were regular, as if any group of seven 
connected boxes were notes in one key. Depending on the direction in 
which one moved, a different note of the chord became the dominant note 
of the next chord. A similar analogy to the spectrum could be made.

I asked whether each of these boxes was a separate universe, or just a 
separate viewpoint within the walls of my own tablet. The answer was that 
the former was the case. Each was a related universe within a larger level 
of creation. our own universe was one of many within an expanded artistic 
theme being played out in a larger frame of reference.

I also saw that by orienting on a set of axes other than those I was looking 
at, a whole new matrix was revealed, with different but intersecting rules. 
Continuing this rotation revealed that these too were infinite in number.

I was told that it was possible for the adept who did not like his own world, 
or who simply wanted to explore, to move from universe to universe within 
any of the matrices. In few of these universes would he find himself in a 
physical world. because such schemes are rare in the larger cosmos. But 
wherever he did find such a universe, he would always arrive in a place 
as congruent as possible with his departure point. Thus he could be 
reasonably assured that he would survive such a trip. In the other worlds, 
only his magickal body would go, leaving his physical body behind. 

----------------------------------------------------

11/22/85

A little after seven, I did a banishing, and invoked the powers of the 
square "R" of the watery lesser angle of the Earth tablet. I did not get any 
images after I visualized the pyramid, other than a blurred vision of the 
sphinx. There was a sense of the presence of the force, but nothing too 
strong came through.

I will do the invocation again before going to bed.

(Ended up not doing so. -BR)


11/26/85

This afternoon, I began to get glimmerings of some sort of vision. I was 
situated (in the vision) above the earth tablet, around the northeast 
corner. I could see the squares of the tablet, with the letters written in for 
the four kerubic squares in enochian. The word "Raph" came to mind. It is 
the name of the angel of the square "R". This square represents Yod of 
Water of Earth. 

5:15 pm approx

Did the invocation of water of earth, and called upon the names, ending 
with NphRa and NRaph, the first governing the kerubic squares of the 
angle as a whole, and the second the special version governing the 
square.

I saw the pyramid, with black to the north with the earth sigil engraved. 
Blue was to the south, blazoned with the sigil of water. East was red with 
the Leo sign, west red with the Yod.

I entered the pyramid, but did not see the sphinx there. So I rose up 
through the planes until I came to a reasonably clear scene. This was like 
the initial image of the square "i" of the fiery lesser Angle, except that a 
lake came up to the south, and the jungle to the east and west was more 
lush. 

It was told that I had come back to this slightly modified scene to indicate 
that after the energies of square "i" pass out of that square, they come to 
this one. They go from Heh final of fire of earth to Yod of water of earth.

Then I rose up again and saw the pyramid from above. The forces of the 
sides, rather than being held back from the top all blended together on the 
truncated top of the pyramid.

Then I saw a true scene of the square. I was in the center of a region of 
hot springs and geysers. The hot springs were small-diameter but deep 
pots, worn into solid rock. Steam wafted up gently from them. (It looked a 
lot like the Plain of Holes in Sgt. Pepper.) The heat was concentrated in 
these holes, and it was relatively cool elsewhere. (Something similar was 
described in Dante's Inferno.)16

I invoked the angel again. The angel that appeared had the same dark 
skin and light hair of the angels of the previous angle, but his clothes had 
a subtle blue sheen to them. The clothes had a sort of flowing motion, as 
if they were caught in some invisible current. The angel wore a pantacle 
of earth about his neck on a chain, and held a cup extended downward as 
if in the act of pouring. The right hand held a wand forward on the center 
line of his body, with the hand at the level of the solar plexus.

Since the angel had changed his aspect a bit from his first appearance, I 
tested again with the signs. He did not respond, but held his pose. The 
pentagrams neither helped nor diminished him, but did make the image 
sharper. The letters caused him to expand.

I asked to see the sphinx, but he instead indicated that I should perform 
the sign in which he was standing. I did so, and he changed to a sign in 
which the arms were held forward from the shoulders, with the elbows 
bowed outwards so that the arms formed a horizontal circle. The wand 
and the cup were held upright before the body. I imitated this sign.

Next he changed to a sign which was like that of Osiris Risen save that 
the arms were held away from the body. The wand and cup were held so 
that the point of the wand touched the rim of the cup above the hands.

I asked, "What is the purpose of these signs?"

The angel said that the signs represented the three alchemical elements, 
sulphur, salt and mercury, as they manifest in this square. The last of the 
signs was Mercury, since it imitated the caduceus.17 The middle one was 
salt, imitating the pantacle. The first was sulphur, with the active wand 
above the passive cup.

Also, in the first sign the water is discarded and the fire raised. In the 
second they are balanced in opposite rotation, producing stability through 
spin. In the last, they intermix, as mercury intermixes sulphur and salt.

I said this was all very well, but what did it have to do with the point of the 
vision. He said "We are very concerned with forms and formula here."

The vision petered out at that point, so I returned to my body and 
reabsorbed the forces.

7:55 pm

Returned to the vision through the pyramid.

Asked to see the effect of the square in the mineral kingdom. Was shown 
the same geyser and hot springs area. Went below the surface, and saw 
the forces generated by the earth's pressure heating the ground water, 
and causing it to expand and come out on the surface of the earth. It 
particularly rules those springs that well up out of the earth underneath 
the ocean, where the tectonic plates meet.

In the plant kingdom, this square rules the process in which water 
evaporates from the leaves due to the heat of the sunlight. As the water 
evaporates, it pulls more water from the earth to replace it. The water 
carries nutrients up from the roots to the growing areas of the plant.

In the animal kingdom, the square controls the distribution of heat from 
the intestines to the rest of the body via the blood. No particular species of 
animal was suggested as an embodiment of the square's force.

I asked for the type of person represented by the square, but I could not 
see it clearly. I concluded that I was too tired from driving all day to get 
much tonight.18

11/27/85 

A vision of square "m" of the Watery Lesser Angle of the Water Tablet.

At 10:52 am, I did a Tarot reading to discover why I was having so much 
trouble getting an image from the squares mentioned above. The cards 
indicated that I would have better results if I changed direction and 
invoked water of water of water, square "m" of the watery lesser angle of 
the water tablet.

I recited the key and the names. The pyramid appeared, with all four sides 
flashing and rippling in the colors of water. Each side held the Enochian 
sigil of water, the cross with 4-g-6-g in the angles, within a circular 
background in the flashing color, orange. The ripples in the sides were 
coordinated so that all sides rippled at the same time, the waves travelling 
from the bottom of the pyramid to the top. I got the impression that the 
pyramid was a vagina, and each set of ripples was like a mild orgasm, 
their motion encouraging the male to release his load of power into 
pyramid. There was nothing demanding about this encouragement, yet 
there was an impression that it could not be gainsaid.19

There was a very light and clean feeling to the square, which intensified 
as I waited in the pyramid. The sphinx appeared, a pure Eagle as is 
appropriate to the square. I gave the 5=6 signs, which he responded to in 
kind. 

I asked to see a landscape that represented the power of the square. 
There was shown a whirlpool in the sea, with all the waters entering from 
the sides blending together and pulling things downwards into the cup-
shaped whirl. The side of the whirlpool had the enochian sigil of water 
imprinted on it. The sigil was undisturbed by the movement of the waters 
on which it was stamped.

I called upon the angel of the square, mtdi, again. She appeared, showing 
herself as a woman in diaphanous blue veils, fully covering her body and 
arms, save when she gestured. Her face and skin were blue in color, with 
orange highlights and shadows. 

She said:

"Know, O worshipper, that here in the watery lesser angle of the water 
tablet are the pure waters of preservation held. Thus Jupiter is the angle 
of water in the Tree, for it preserves that which is built by the angle of fire, 
which is Mars in the Tree.20

"Isis, our goddess, is the creator and preserver of the forms. She takes 
the impulse of the gods, and transforms it into herself, reflecting the initial 
impulse in a manner which continues to reverberate through her 
substance. She is the Wave, where fire is the Quantum. She takes the 
impulse and reproduces it many times over. Thus where the original 
impulse was singular, its effect is multiplied and distributed here. You saw 
some of this in the square "m" of the fiery lesser angle of earth, which is 
also of water within its own area of action.

"As well as multiplying the force, water causes it to be sustained over 
time. Though the impulse is momentary, its ripples continue to be 
reflected in the movement of the water. Thus she preserves it.

"Water is the reflection of the mass action of many quanta. While their 
true nature in themselves may be of fire, their action as a multitude is of 
the nature of water. For are not the waves made of the quanta, yet do 
they wave despite this."

I then saw a multitude of impulses, little photon-like particles, milling about 
in a space. Each particle moved along its own course, and seemed to act 
independently of any other, yet when the actions of all the particles were 
seen at once, there were larger-scale motions that were clearly wave-like 
and orderly travelling through the soup of particles.

"Yea, the particles are truly Osiris, torn to pieces by the anger of Set. Yet 
Isis has gathered the pieces together to make a new Osiris, greater than 
the one who came before, for he is expanded and diversified, both more 
detailed and broader in his scope." (That is, each particle reflects the 
original impulse, and acts in accord with that impulse's nature, yet also 
acts as one component within a larger creation, which will also reflect the 
power of the original impulse when it is fully manifested.)

I asked to see how this power works out in the mineral kingdom. The 
angel told me that the power works equally in all kingdoms, that it is a 
general principle. All things reflect its action. Its power in general is given 
to the females, though males are equally capable of understanding it once 
their conditioning is removed.

However, within the mineral kingdom, it might be said in part that this 
power is reflected in the process by which a small amount of radioactive 
substance, put in contact with another substance which is not radioactive, 
changes the latter substance into more of itself. This is the principle of the 
"breeder" reactor. (It is the "reproduction" of the original matter which is 
represented here, not the specific impulse which causes the change to 
take place.)

The action of natural water as a solvent is also of this square, for it takes 
the quanta (in this case, the atoms) of the material, and distributes them 
throughout itself, taking on something of the quality of the thing dissolved.

In the plant kingdom, this power rules all water-plants, and all those plants 
that use water-borne pollen as the intermediary between the male and 
female plants, as well as those that use water to transport the resulting 
seeds.

In the animal kingdom, sea-mammals such as porpoises and dolphins, 
and the manatee, are ruled by this square and by water generally.

I asked to see the type of person represented by the square. I was shown 
a woman in the act of opening herself fully and without reservation to a 
male for purposes of reproduction. It was emphasized that the emotional 
state, rather than the act, was the important thing.

The angel told me that the difference between quantum-like and wave-like 
phenomena in physics exactly reflects the differences between Fire and 
Water in the Enochian system. Quantum phenomena, like Fire, deal with 
the actions of individual particles. When physicists look at a particle, they 
can not tell exactly what it is doing at any given time. Its movements and 
changes randomly select among the possibilities open to it by its nature. 
Its actions are discontinuous, changing instantly from one state to 
another, with no transition between.

But when the particles are observed in large groups, they act in an orderly 
way. Their individually discontinuous actions taken together produce 
phenomena that are seemingly continuous. The atoms of mundane water 
are made up of such particles, yet their discontinuity does not prevent a 
wave from moving across the surface of a pond. The wave phenomena 
are a new order of event, superimposed on and encompassing the 
original natures of the fiery impulses. 

I ended the vision and closed the astral temple.

For the last two days I have been trying to get more out of the squares via 
repeated invocations. While there has certainly been a perceptible effect 
from these invocations, I can not seem to get any kind of reliable vision 
out of the invoked energies.

I attempted to invoke the square "t", yod of water of water, and got just an 
image of a raging tempest, with water thrashing about in all directions. 
There was also a hint of Leviathan lying just below the surface. Other than 
that, nothing.

In general, the invocations have resulted in a filling out of my aura with 
watery force. I can see the blue of it filtering everything I look at even right 
now, twenty hours after the last invocation. There has also been a general 
attraction to things watery. I have taken several more showers than I 
usually do in this amount of time, just for the pleasure of it.

There have also been some scraps of vision relating to woman-as-water, 
but there seems to be some kind of interference that is keeping me from 
perceiving them fully. Probably just the quality of my mind at present.

The tarot indicates that the main effect of these invocations has been at 
an unconscious level, and not open to my mundane awareness.

Other scraps I have picked up:

1. An indication that I should be looking again at the fiery lesser angle of 
earth, rather than continuing with the water angle and tablet. I'll do an I 
Ching and tarot reading to check this out tonight.

2. There is a possibility that the tablets can be used in some way as a 
form of divination. If the individual forces could be understood easily, then 
I could see how this might be useful. There are certainly enough different 
forces in the system to comprise a reasonably inclusive form of 
symbolism.

 I also wonder if the squares might be used to make up a language of 
symbolism in which stories or facts could be given. This is something 
slightly different than using the angelic language in which the keys or calls 
are written. Each square would be one root-word or root-symbol, which 
could then be modified by the presence of other root-symbols to produce 
specific concepts. Something like a universal translation key.

(I don't know whether these two points come in some way as the result of 
the invocation, or are just wish-fulfillments.)

3. Additionally, there have been some fantasy images of extreme 
psychological and physical conditioning being used to make a woman as 
receptive and water-like as possible. I take these as a degeneration of the 
action of the forces, acting on some of my suppressed and not-so-
suppressed feelings about women.21


12/1/85

Another vision of the square "R" of the Watery Lesser Angle of Earth.

I invoked the watery lesser angle of the earth tablet, and called upon the 
names, MOR DIAL HCTGA, ICZHIKAL, ANAEEM, SONDN, RAPH.

The pyramid appeared, with the north side glowing black with the earth 
sign in white, the south glowing blue with the water sign in orange, the 
east and west glowing red with the signs of the lion-kerub and the Yod, 
respectively, in green. I entered into the pyramid.

The sphinx appeared. He had the head of a bull, the body of a lion, and 
the hind legs and tail of the eagle. I performed the 5=6 signs, he 
responded with the Rending of the Veil sign, followed by the signs of 
Earth, Water, and Fire, followed by the Closing of the Veil sign. 

I called upon the god of the square, Ameshet, and saw him with orange 
face, blue nemyss, and black, yellow, and orange stripes on his 
shoulders. I did the 5=6 signs with him, and tested him with the 
pentagrams. Instead of the pentagrams having an effect on him, I 
suddenly found my own consciousness united with that of the god, so that 
I could see myself across the floor of the pyramid, wearing a black robe 
with blue lining and red pockets and edges. The pentagram hanging in the 
air between us glowed, filling the god with force, which he absorbed 
without difficulty.

I spent a few minutes concentrating on the consciousness of the god. His 
force seemed to satisfy the conditions of the square. I could sense the 
slow solidity or stability of Earth, spread uniformly throughout his being by 
the waters, with the fires bringing a sense of power or rulership to him. I 
saw that as he looked at me across the floor of the pyramind that he 
approved of my efforts to gather visions of these squares.

Ameshet said: "Know, o innocent, that you have come here for 
knowledge, and knowledge shall you get in full measure, if you be patient 
enough.

"Here in the watery lesser angle of the earth tablet, we take the forces of 
life that have been injected into the earth, and allowed to grow on its 
surface, and we give these lives forms and functions within the world to 
which they have been assigned. There is nothing in the original impulse 
that determines the way in which it will manifest in the world, out of the 
multitude of possible manifestations. For, even in the earth, the fire is 
formless. We provide the environment by which the energy obtains its 
context, thereby forcing it into a form which is suitable through its will-to-
be.

I asked to see the action of this square, "R", in the mineral kingdom. I was 
shown a place deep under the earth, in which elements were dissolved 
from the earth by the action of hot water, whose heat in turn was derived 
from the pressure of the earth. As the solutions became saturated, the 
elements tended to precipitate from the water, forming crystals of pure 
substance. 

I saw that the waters that did the dissolving were encapsulated, just as 
the fires of Yod of Fire of Earth had been. These pockets formed where 
bubbles had existed in the magma when this section of the earth had 
cooled below melting temperature. The water precipitated into the pockets 
due to its lower heat retention. 

Because we were deep below the earth, the pressure of the earth above 
produced the heat. This fire caused molecules of the rock to be more 
easily dissolved by the water, and caused the water to become a more 
effective solvent.

Eventually, the water could not hold any more dissolved minerals, and the 
action of the fire was lessened. The minerals began to precipitate out of 
the solution onto the walls of the capsule. But only those elements that 
could be solids at the existing temperature precipitated. These pure or 
nearly pure elements formed crystals and lattices on the insides of the 
capsules. The result of this process was pockets of pure minerals or 
gemstones, or geodes.

I asked to see the effect of this square in the plant kingdom. I was shown 
a seed buried in the earth. The waters from the melting of the winter 
snows washed a protective covering off of the seed, signalling the seed 
that it was time for it to break its shell. 

A representation of the force in the animal kingdom was shown, but I 
could not see it clearly.

In the human kingdom, this square governs changes of life-direction that 
occur suddenly after a long period of buildup where the impending change 
was not apparent. One example of this is the male "mid-life crisis". The 
sudden thrusting-out of a child from the woman at parturition is also 
governed in part by this square, although there are multiple aspects to this 
process that are governed by other squares.

I asked to see the spiritual animal governed by the square. I was shown 
an animal that had an extremely round body, with flipper-like limbs and 
short, stubby legs. It does little except sit while it grows slowly larger. But 
at the same time I got an image that this animal thinks of itself as a big, 
impressive monster. (I got the impression that the animal was like a 
rockbound version of the puffer fish, which blows itself up with water in 
order to scare enemies.)

I asked to be returned to the pyramid, and this was done. I stood there for 
a moment, absorbing the force of the square, and then turned to Ameshet 
again.

He said: "Know, o worshipper, that here we have given you the 
beginnings of the wisdom of water of earth, but that there is much yet 
here to see in these squares Kerubic of the Angle. Let this student return 
to the angle in the next few hours, going this time to the square of Heh of 
Water of Fire, there to continue the quest. Do you come again within the 
day, and we will see much more. For now, return to your body fully, and 
think of something else for a while. You might also review your prior vision 
of this square to see any connections between them."

I left the pyramid and came out into my astral temple. From there, I 
banished the square and closed the temple.

12/1/85 5:56 pm

In invoked the forces of the lesser angle, using the names MOR DIAL 
HCTGA, ICZHIKAL, CABALPT, ANAEEM, APHR. Visualized the pyramid, 
with the north side black with white earth-symbol, south blue with orange 
water-symbol, east blue with orange eagle and water-symbol, west blue 
with orange Heh and water-symbol.

Entered into the pyramid, and saw the sphinx. The sphinx was bull-
headed, with a blue and orange nemyss. The body, legs and tail were that 
of the eagle.

I called upon the goddess of the square, Isis. She appeared, wearing a 
blue uraeus crown, blue skirt with orange chest-straps, carrying a lotus 
wand. Her skin was yellow. I did the 5=6 signs. She answered with the 
Rending of the Veil, the earth and water signs, and the Closing of the Veil. 

I tested her with the pentagrams, and as in the previous vision, my 
consciousness entered into that of the Goddess. As her, I saw myself 
across the pyramid, drawing the pentagram of earth. As the goddess I 
absorbed its force and grew bigger. I saw myself draw the water 
pentagram, and grew even larger.

Isis looked at me and saw that I was visiting to gain information. She said: 
"It is a wise son who knows his mother's advice." At my request, she 
showed me the sphinx of her power. It was like unto the original sphinx of 
the square, save that its body was that of a scorpion rather than of an 
eagle. By this, she said, she meant to emphasize that the waters not only 
related to the products of life, but also of the end- or death-products of the 
earth's system.

She showed me the waters flowing through underground caverns, 
carrying dissolved minerals from one place to another within the earth, 
causing internal formations such as limestone caves to appear. The water 
takes itself into every crack and cranny in the earth distributing its load. 
The minerals thus distributed contributed to the health of the plants that 
draw their sustenance from the earth.

Above the earth, the action of the square represents the erosion of the 
stone of the heights of Earth, and its transport by the water to the 
lowlands, where it becomes rich growing land. The more poisonous 
effluents continue in dissolved condition until the water reaches the sea, 
where they are distributed in less than lethal concentrations throughout 
the ocean. The saltiness of the sea results from the power of this square, 
though once in the sea it becomes the earth of water instead. 

Asked to show its effects on humans, Isis showed me a mother nursing 
her child. The substance of her milk is the water of earth. A person taking 
on arduous or unpleasant jobs for the sake of others was also shown. In 
the mind of man, she said, the effect is to produce those emotions related 
to the physical welfare of the family unit.

I asked to see the effect in the animal kingdom. I was shown a dog 
reacting to its owner's commands with complete submission. Isis 
explained that the dog's emotions, his water-nature, had been reoriented 
so that he perceived his master as his pack-leader. The submissive 
responses of subordinate pack-animals is generally ruled by this square.

Isis said: "Know ye, O man, that here in the watery lesser angle [of earth] 
do the forces of earth concentrate their poisons for elimination, even as 
they distribute the wealth of the earth to the places of need. Thus the 
scorpion is also part of the sphinx here. The products of the degeneration 
of living matter that can not be reabsorbed by the system are taken by the 
water to a place where they can not be of danger. Yet man does tax them 
greatly in this time, by his creations out of the earth, and the force of the 
square is weakened by its failure. Thus does man fill up his world with his 
own source of Death.

"While yet the time remains until the end of things, when the earth and all 
upon her are raised up beyond the material, so shall this square continue 
to work for the cleanliness and health of the world. Pray ye that the end 
come soon, so that the earth may pass in beauty and not in squalor of its 
children's devising. 

"Go ye now unto the ends of the earth, and preach this message: Keep ye 
the earth clean, and it shall reward ye an hundredfold with life more 
abundant yet. Yet this also applies to thee in thine own person. Cleanse 
ye of the poisons of thy mundane life, and here we will give ye more than 
man ever yet received of us."

I acknowledged the necessity of this, since certain habits, such as 
smoking cigarettes, were proving to be keeping me from complete 
success in some aspects of the magickal work. I waited to see if Isis 
would continue.

She did, showing me a scene of people all seated in a church, with a 
bride and groom at the altar waiting to be married. The man was myself, 
the woman's feature could not be seen due to her veils.

Isis said: "Know ye that she who would be thy mate longs to approach 
thee, yet she fears of ye because of thine aspect of death. Reduce this 
aspect as ye have done, and bring in the balances of rightness. The 
cleansing of the body must be one part of this, for the scorpion hath had 
ye for thine whole life, and now his effluvia must be washed away to 
reveal the emerald jewels he has perfected in his compost. Clean ye thine 
house as well, taking from it the residue of thy habits. Then shall ye feel 
free, and so will she, to join together."22

I asked Isis whether there was anything else to be said at this time. She 
indicated that there was, but that I should wait a few moments, get 
something to drink, and return. I did this.

Isis said: "Now that we have told ye of what we desire of ye, there is yet 
one more thing to say at this time. Know ye that ye are the chosen priest 
and apostle of the Gods of Liber Al for the coming few years. That ye 
reject this is known and considered, but ye shall have no choice in the 
matter, no more than the prior two who have helped them so well, the one 
known, the other not, yet both of the highest degree of our confidence. Ye 
shall continue to reject all who try to assign you to a place or space within 
their organization, for it is the truth of the book that ye shall do what Thou 
wilt, not as others shall say. All their signs and symbols are corrupted with 
their humanness, and have lost their effectiveness in the pursuit of the 
gods' goals. Follow thine own path, and ye shall be rewarded as ye have 
seen.

"Ye wonder whether there shall be a sign of this event, whether ye shall 
have to proclaim thyself the Beast, and take on the aspects of power over 
others. This I say to ye as a solemn promise: That power shall not corrupt 
thee. Take ye the course that is opened to ye, and all shall be well. Let it 
be so.

"Of proclaiming yourself the Beast, I say that ye have already done so. 
Did ye not select this name as thine own in thy battles with the Christians? 
So it is and so shall it be.

"Of the signs I speak not, save to say that ye shall see that which shall 
convince ye of the truth of what we speak beyond any ability to doubt. 
Look ye not for such a sign.23

"Continue to explore these squares of earth and water in the next few 
days. What comes will be useful and educational, both to ye and to those 
who read thine accounts.

"This vision is ended."

I then returned to my temple, did a quick banishing of the forces, and 
returned fully to my body.

12/3/85

Last night, invoked the square "p" of the watery lesser angle around 9:15 
pm. Got a clear image of the pyramid, but the vision did not want to go 
any further.

After several minutes of rising on planes and tearing the veils, I got an 
image of the square.

I was somewhere on the face of a cliff. Below me I could see a raging 
river in a narrow canyon. From the top of the cliff, a waterfall poured. But 
before the water could reach the river below, it was torn into spray by the 
wind.

I went down to the level of the river, and saw that the air above it was 
filled with little bits of water. The bits were too large to be called mist, and 
too small to be called drizzle. They were exactly the maximum size 
droplet that could be suspended in air indefinitely.

This is about all I could get. I never saw the sphinx or the God of the 
square, and never saw any other beings in the vision. I gave up and 
returned to my body.

Afterwards, I noticed that the pyramid had actually formulated itself in 
etheric matter in my bedroom. It was large enough to completely contain 
the queen-sized bed. When I got up to go to the bathroom, I saw in the 
mirror that the pyramid had also formulated itself in my own aura. I could 
see in the mirror that the top side of the square, colored black, covered 
my head and my neck to the shoulders. From my neck to just below the 
navel, the aura had expaning wings of yellow fanning out to both sides. 
From the navel down, the aura was the blue of the lowest of the four 
sides.

I returned to the bed and saw that the pyramid was still there as well. It 
persisted until after I had fallen asleep. There is still some faint image of it 
visible even now, 22 hours later. I am about to do the invocation again, 
and will add to this account afterwards.

(Astrological note -- Currently Uranus is transiting in a tetranovile aspect 
to my moon, and just came into orb of a conjunction with my sun. This 
may have the effect of aborting any astral visions for the duration of the 
transits, since most of my visionary ability depends on these two planets, 
particularly the sun. If so, the remaining invocations may have to wait until 
the aspect passes in January. I intend to try at least three more times to 
get a vision of this square. If I am unable to do so after that many 
invocations, it would seem approriate to delay the remaining work. But 
somehow I sense that it would be a mistake to do so.)


12/3/85 9:15 pm.

The vision opened with the pyramid in the magickal circle of my astral 
temple. The sides were all of the appropriate colors with the correct 
symbols upon them. I repeated the names of invocation a couple of times 
more, then entered the pyramid.

There I saw the sphinx, who had the head of a longhorn bull, the body of 
a man, with the hips, legs and tail of the eagle. I did the 5=6 signs, he 
responded in kind and added the earth, water, and air signs.

The sphinx indicated that tonight's vision would be less of a vision than a 
dictation in the style of my usual communications with disincarnate 
humans. That is, through a sort of "automatic typing". I went to my office 
and set up my word-processor. I then returned my astral vision to the 
scene in the pyramid.

I asked to see a vision of the square's function. I was taken to the same 
stream-canyon with which last night's vision ended, and there I saw the 
valley from above. It was night, and all the droplets of water I had seen 
hanging above the stream were shown to be glowing in the dark. They 
looked like a river of stars from my vantage point, shining brightly as they 
flowed down the canyon.

I called upon the sphinx to explain the vision. He said:

"Know ye, o student, that in this place are the waters of earth distributed 
to the ends of creation. The natural tendency of the water is to flow to the 
lowest point within the earth, as is shown by its being in the bottom of the 
canyon here. But the winds of the quarter whip up a froth from the waves, 
so that as fast as it flows downward, it is blown upward again. 

"Now the waters do desire to spread themselves througout the earth, but 
on their own they are confined to the areas where the earth opens to 
them. Thus, the assistance of the air in called upon.

"In the natural world, this square rules those waters taken up into the air 
in cyclones, hurricanes, and strong winds, which are carried to places 
where the water could not otherwise go upon the earth.

"In the spiritual world, this square rules those lives of men who desire to 
be raised up from their mundane place, but lack the strength of ambition 
or determination to do so fully on their own. If the spirit of the man seeks 
ever upwards, then is the spirit lightened somewhat from the weight of its 
mundane experiences. Thus the winds of Aleph can lift them up from the 
earth into the lower heavens of Yesod.24 From there, if they are ever 
desirous, they can absorb enough of the spirit-stuff to keep themselves 
afloat in the heavens, as the droplets of water, while heavy in themselves, 
are borne up by the winds of the square. Thus, the droplets in the vision 
here are glowing with the increased force which holds them above the 
waters from which they came, as the spirit of man is lightened by its 
aspiration. There is more to say on this in the next square, which is earth 
of water of earth. We will show you that at the proper time.

"For now, let us continue with the current square. Within the field of the 
plant life, this square rules all plants that live in the water, yet spread their 
seeds through the air. 

"The best example of this is the cattail of the northern climes. It lives not in 
the pure waters of lakes and streams, but in the water-saturated grounds 
of bogs, culverts and ditches. It takes the waters of the earth in those 
places, and raises them up into the air by the length of its stalk. There it 
combines the water with the air, as all plants do, to produce the substance 
of the seeds which are its "tail". The seeds hold the water in place above 
the earth until they are ripe and ready to be sent to new places. Then the 
seeds release their water to the air, transforming it from bog water into 
pure vapors, which spread throughout the air, to fall as rain under another 
square's direction. The seeds themselves repeat this sending. Being of 
the nature of water of earth themselves, they yet are blown by the winds 
into the farthest corners of the earth, there to lie fallow until again they 
have the water of earth to raise up.

"In the animal kingdom, this square rules the aspirations of domestic 
animals to be like their masters, we who are human souls. (Though I 
come to you as the sphinx, which my nature duplicates, yet am I as 
human as are you, o man.) 

I was shown an image of a dog that belongs to a friend of mine. This 
animal understands a vocabulary of about thirty words, making him a 
genius among canines. He also frequently tries to imitate the behavior of 
his master. He reacts to the emotional atmosphere with expression and 
behavior that are an uncanny reflection of her own usual reactions to 
similar situations. He does this whether she is present or not. He is also 
the only animal I know that is creative. On his own, he has thought up 
several games to occupy himself with when the humans don't have time 
for him. He plays according to rules that are clear to any observer. If he 
decides he doesn't like a particular rule after some experimentation with it, 
then he will change that rule all at once and never use the old rule again 
in that game.

The sphinx continued: "Such beings live intensely on the astral levels, yet 
their astral is limited to that part which relates to their earth-lives. The 
emotion which powers their astral life is the water gathered from out of 
their earth-experience. In the breeding and improvement of the breeds for 
our own purposes, we have caused some of these animals to evolve to 
the point where they are on the threshold of developing an human 
consciousness, adding the sphere of mind to that of emotion. Thus we 
have Air of Water of Earth.

"It also rules those animals who gather their food from the waters, yet live 
in the air. These are not the aquatic birds, which are ruled under the tablet 
of air, but those insects and other small things which fly above the waters, 
looking for that which can feed them to rise up out of the waters, as 
certain insects wait for the larvae of mosquitos to hatch and arise, inorder 
to feed upon them. The water-striders are one such in your experience. 
Those spiders who spin their webs just above the waters are another 
such. Mammals also do this sometimes, but the majority do not depend 
entirely on the waters for their nourishment, and thus are not fully 
governed by this square.

"In the human kingdom, as well as the aspirations referred to before, the 
square also rules those group-feelings which cause the masses of men to 
suddenly rise up against their government, demanding better than they 
have had of it in the past. All populist movements originate under this 
square, though all go their separate ways as they emerge from the waters 
of the mass experience of man, which is the emotional nature of that 
creature called Humanity. The salt of the earth directs its emotion to an 
idea, again creating Air out of Water of Earth.

"In the spiritual kingdom, we see those who have risen out of the earth as 
said before, and as well, those who are ready to advance to any higher 
level. We here see this square as the look of one who sees beyond 
himself into the heavens, and desires, at any level, to be raised up to the 
next. 

"Even though the square is in a mundane tablet, yet this is the case, 
because the First Matter which is worked upon in any initiation is the soul 
of the man involved. Though it is of the spirit, and of the Sun, yet it is the 
earth in relation to that which comes next above it.

"Now, the time has come for us to tell you more of your own adventure to 
come. Since we are in a square of great  aspirations, this is appropriate to 
the power here.

"In the last vision, we told you that you are to be the Beast of this next 
generation of magicians." 

(I acknowledged that they had told me this..)

"You agree that this was what was said, yet you resist accepting it. We 
understand that this is due to your early bad experiences with this form of 
communication we are using, in which you came under the influence of 
spirits unworthy of your power or attention. That you had the good sense 
to cut off those communications is to your great credit. Many of those who 
have tried this method have fallen by the wayside in their early days due 
to just this thing. Those others who did not fall and who managed to 
progress as you have done since then in its use are counted by us as the 
best hope we have to get our message to the world in this time.

"It is vital that you be fully initiated into the grade of Master of the Temple 
before this comes about, both because of your own oath in this area,25 
and because only the masters can judge the message with full 
understanding, and thereby be confident of its necessity.

"In the next few weeks and possibly months, we will be giving to you 
gradually those things you need to be ready for this initiation.26 To allow 
us the right conditions in which to do this, you should continue with this 
project of doing all the kerubic squares of the Earth tablet. We, or those 
more suited, will give you the meaning of each square, and those 
attributions of it to the various worlds, each in the manner he is most 
comfortable with. Some will be like this current communication, in which 
you essentially transfer my dictation directly to your fingers to type. Others 
will be of the more frequently used visionary style which you like so much 
but feel to be your weak point. Yet others will be done in other ways, as 
the gods dictate for their new cousin.

"Now, finish up the typing of this document for tonight, and go to your bed 
and comtemplate the Tarot for a while."

I asked if he had anything more to say about the nature of the message. It 
was indicated that this must be given in detail at a much later date, and 
would in fact be part of my initiation as a Master of the Temple.

The sphinx added: "We see that you are anxious about this yet, as is 
natural to one who has suffered so at the hands of those who should be of 
good will to his spirit. Know that there shall be a sign which is not only 
enough to convince you, but to convince those who need to be convinced 
in order for the work to be carried forward. We will not leave you in the 
cold with no basis on which to justify yourself other than our 
communications themselves. But the nature of the sign is such that you 
will not realize it until long after it has occurred, at which point it will fall on 
you as a flash of lightning from the sky."

"Be patient, be gentle with yourself, and pursue those other avenues that 
open to you as you see fit. Among them are those that you will need. Of 
the woman who is to be your scarlet woman, I may speak not, for it is not 
my place to control your destiny. Seek you in your life and she will 
appear."

"You should end this vision now."

I returned to the astral temple, closed it after giving thanks for another 
square revealed, and returned to my body fully.

12/6/85

The square "h" of the watery lesser angle of earth.

8.30 pm

I recited the calls, and called upon the names, MOR DIAL HCTGA, 
ICZHIHAL, ANAEEM, SONDN, HRAP. The pyramid appeared, showing 
the north, east, and west sides in the black of earth, the south in the blue 
and orange of water.

Entering the pyramid, I called upon the name hRap again. Then I called 
for the sphinx to appear. He did so, showing himself as a bull with the tail 
of an eagle. I saluted him with the 5=6 sign, and he returned it, after which 
he bowed to me. I tested him with the pentagrams, which caused him to 
become a little clearer in the vision. 

He said: "Greetings to you, o man, from the watery lesser angle of the 
earth tablet. I have come here at your call to show you what you wish of 
this place."

He lay down on his left side, with his rear hooves laid out to the right. I 
asked him to show me an image of the powers of the square. Instantly we 
were high in the air, looking down on a world that was cubic in shape. 
Within the cube, swirls of blue could be seen moving, and they did not 
cause the cube to change shape.

I said "Tell me, o sphinx, of the meaning ofthis image."

He said: "The waters of earth have returned to the earth, and give it its 
receptiveness and internal mutability. Thus, those things of earth maintain 
their form, despite the movements of the tiny fires within them." I took the 
"tiny fires" to be the atoms and molecules that make up the matter.

The sphinx appeared to have nothing more to say, so I called upon the 
goddess ruling the square, Nepthys. Vibrating her name several times did 
not cause her to appear. Instead, my own astral body began to grow 
larger, and as it did so, it adopted the shape of the goddess. I grew until it 
was larger than the earth. I then felt her presence inhabiting the body with 
me.

Nepthys said: "Oh man, thou art in the middle of a great sea-change, and 
the energies of the water of earth have great difficulty in fighting their way 
through the forces of Uranus that surround you now. Let it be that you do 
not do these squares of earth again until this pass be done. At that time, 
we will continue, if you so wish, with the exposition of these squares.

"Now, if you would continue to do something with the Enochian Walls 
during this time, I would call to your attention the squares of the central 
cross of the Wall."

I asked if these would be of greater efficacy in this time, and if she could 
suggest any particular squares to do from the cross.

She said: "Now, the great cross binds all the squares of the lesser angles 
of the tablet together, and is of a higher rate of vibration than these 
kerubic squares, and those other squares of the lesser angle. In your 
current state, your internal rate of vibration has been increased by the 
influence of the planet [Uranus], so that you can not see the weaker 
vibrations of the squares. This is why you have such great trouble now. 
Your own vibrations tend to wash out the image.

"If you wish to do the central cross squares, I suggest to you that you 
study again the attributions of these squares to the decanates. Look to 
them to see if there is one that might be of use in explaining the things 
that you are now going to go through. If nothing comes to mind directly, 
look to the Tarot to inspire your intuition with the proper course.27"

I waited for Nepthys to continue.

She said: "Now, you have called upon me here, and I must answer you. 
The powers of this square are those of the earth when it is frozen into its 
solid state. But within the solid, the waters are present. This causes the 
molecules of the solid to vibrate with the flow of forces around and 
through them. It is, in fact, the responsiveness of earth to impulses, 
electromagnetic, spiritual, or grossly physical.

"Without the water within the earth, then earth would be nothing but inert, 
ever as it was in the beginning, unchanging and unchanged. Without the 
waters of earth, the earth could not hold the souls of the men and 
creatures who inhabit her, for they are of fire, and fire requires its 
complement to give form to its creativity.

"Within the earth, this square causes the fires of the beginning, the Great 
Orgasm which began all things, to take on form. As it is said: 'In the 
beginning the earth was without form, and void, and darkness covered the 
face of the earth.' This was the earth that was before the beginning.

"'And the gods divided the waters above from the waters below.' That is, 
they caused the void to become responsive by creating in it the potential 
of duality. Yet the earth was not, yet.

"'And the gods said, Let there be light, and there was light.' Thus occured 
the Great Orgasm, the ejaculation which spewed into the void the 
energies which were to become the powers of all the squares of the 
Walls. Yet even now, there was no form upon the face of existence.

"The fires of the Orgasm, in their original state, were of such a high rate of 
vibration that nothing could be made of them, but that it immediately was 
unmade. Chaos ruled the cosmos for an instant that was an eternity. 

"It was only when the fires were cooled by the waters of the previously-
created potential space that existence became possible. It was the 
manner in which those pre-existence waters were divided that caused the 
fires of the Orgasm to take the forms that allow life to come into being 
within the cosmos that was the fires. For the Two became the Four, each 
reflecting itself in the other, doubling itself, folding itself over. Had the 
water been divided into the Three, then the world would now be based on 
sixes, not fours, and six would be the number of Establishment, not the 
number of the Art of the Design.

"Look you now to that smallest of levels within the world, and see that 
those particles there are held in their shapes, not by their own internal 
structure, but by the counter-pressure of the waters. 

I looked, and saw before me a sub-subatomic particle, a quark, or 
whatever it is that quarks are made of. These particles had the will to fly 
apart from each other, and to return to the original chaos. But as they 
grew farther apart from each other, the pressure of the waters forced 
them back together again, so that no matter how forcefully they flew apart, 
yet they could not get beyond a certain distance from each other.

"These tiny particles, always in threes, together made up one element of 
the Four, in each of the three phases that the gods did allow. Thus, in the 
first of the visions of this angle, we showed you the signs of Sulphur, Salt, 
and Mercury, within the fires of water of earth.

"When the waters had spread the fires of the Orgasm thoughout the void, 
and relieved the pressure of its bursting by absorbing that pressure into 
themselves, then it was that creation became manifest in the world as it is 
now. The tiny sparks, in their threes, moved about in the waters. Yet the 
form-giving nature of the waters caused these motions to all be of certain 
types, so that larger patterns of motion could be seen in their joint 
wanderings. The waters, reflecting back on themselves, caused these 
larger patterns to group themselves, and to hold together in the manner of 
the original particles. Thus were made the so-called 'elementary' particles, 
which in turn made up the atoms, which in turn made up the molcules, 
which in turn made up the world as man knows it in his uninitiated state.

"At all levels did the waters hold the fires, and cool them, so that these 
larger forms could come into being. Thus, at all times and in all places did 
the energies of the Orgasm weaken, but in their weakening did they allow 
for greater complexity. Know ye that the law which man calls entropy is 
partly a lie, for matter does not go from greater order to lesser order, but 
from lesser order to greater order. The appearance of Chaos returning as 
the fires weaken and disperse is the fault of man's viewpoint, not an 
actuality of the cosmos. For as the energies disperse in the so-called 
entropy, there are created ever more particles out of the dispersed 
energy, and thus the interactions and combinations possible within the 
cosmos increase ever in number. This is the perpetual unfolding of the 
mysteries within the realms of Earth."

"Now, as to the effect of this square and its companions in the larger 
worlds, there is much more to be said than can be said in one trip into the 
vision. As your intuition has grasped in the moments of insight you have 
had since beginning on this lesser angle, the key to the understanding of 
the angle is in the processes of birth and creation on all levels. There is 
within these squares the key..."

Nephthys suddenly stopped speaking. I waited, and got an impression 
that I should wait for a moment while she marshalled her speech. I did so.

After a few minutes, Nepthys spoke again: "The other gods in this place 
where I live have reminded me that you have intent to distribute these 
visions so that other magicians and students might learn from them. For 
this reason I can say no more in this place of what I had intended to say 
to you. For there is a mystery here that you should not know to reveal at 
this time, and if we had told you, your own integrity would not allow you to 
edit it out of the vision as you will publish it. This is an admirable motive, 
and we approve of it, but in this instance, it would be better for things to 
be left for the time when they can be accepted fully. For now, contemplate 
the nature of the birth process in humans when you have the chance, and 
see how this relates to the squares of this angle. When the time is right, 
you will understand and tell of these things to those who need to know.

"We know that you are a hater of secrecy, and have refused to join any 
such organization as the OTO, or of the many successors to the Golden 
Dawn, because you fear they would cause you to take oaths that you 
could not abide by concerning the revelation of the knowledge. We are 
aware that your judgment would allow you to keep something secret if the 
reasons were right, but in this instance, your judgment lacks a firm 
foundation. So we withhold what you deserve for yourself, in order that it 
not be spread prematurely.

I said to the goddess that I understood her, and that I would abide without 
protest the decision not to show whatever it was they had withheld. I 
asked the goddess if there was more to say at this point, and she said 
that there was, but that she was not the one to say it.

I got a sense that there was another being present, besides myself and 
the goddess, a being much more powerful than her, waiting for something 
before speaking. The goddess herself did not speak further. 

I waited, and still there was no speech from the goddess, or from whoever 
was waiting behind her. I called upon that being to show himself (its aura 
was definitely male in quality), but got only a sense of amusement.

There seemingly being nothing more to the vision, I separated myself 
from the goddess, saluted her again with the 5=6 signs. As I did so, the 
force of the square surged up around me. It ebbed again, and I was back 
in my astral temple.

I banished the forces of the square from the temple, and returned to my 
body.












A Vision of the square "Z" of the Airy Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.

12/12/85 8:30 pm

I vibrated the calls and the names. Immediately there was an image of 
furiously blowing air, rising above a hot dry land.

A voice said: "Holy, Holy, Holy, yea thrice and four times holy are the fires 
that blow within the angle of earth, for they bring light to the world. Yet 
above them is the darkness of matter."28

I visualized the pyramid, and found myself suddenly within it without 
willing it. The sphinx confronted me, showing the aspect of the bulls head, 
a lion's front legs and torso, and the rear legs of the man. Like a minotaur 
with paws.

I gave him the 5=6 signs, which he answered with 5=6, and the earth, air, 
and fire signs. He led me to an altar in the middle of the pyramid, and 
asked me to lay my hand upon it. I put down my right hand to it, and was 
immediately engulfed in an aura of bright yellow flecked with red.29

He told me that this was in order to allow me to feel the force of this place 
in its purity, before encountering it in the visions to come. The reason for 
this was that I was still feeling the effects of the Uranus transit, which was 
not yet completed, and the extra force would help me to get a purer, and 
clearer vision of the squares. He advised me that it was likely that I would 
still have trouble seeing some of the aspects of the squares, but that it 
was necessary now to invoke them in order to keep the momentum of my 
work going.

While he said this I had stepped back from the altar, and could see that it 
was a cubical altar of the universe, not two cubes as in the standard G.D. 
altar, but only one, resting on the side attributed to the spirit, with the 
tablets as the sides, and a brilliant white top, which was for the unknown 
tablet that is invoked by the unrevealed key 0 of the Enochian calls.

Now he told me to step forward again and take my hands to the side of 
the altar showing the earth tablet. I did so, and he guided me to put my 
hands on the Kerubic squares of the Airy Lesser Angle. I did so, putting 
my right hand over the letters Z and a, and the left hand over the letters b 
and O. 

This produced the sensation of the elements rushing at me from all sides 
at once, to meld together in the center of my chest. I said to him that the 
force felt more general than simply that of these few squares, but the 
sphinx told me that I was simply feeling the power of the letters of IHVH 
whole, within the angle of Air of Earth.

I didn't understand this until I removed my hands, and saw that the sides 
of the squares showed the elemental colors glowing brightly. The heels of 
my hands had rested primarily on the two horizontal sides of each 
square's pyramid, and less so on the top and the bottom that indicated the 
tablet and lesser angle.

"Now, in order to go further with this vision", said he, "you must think of 
the god of this square. This god is Kabexnuf, who shows the aspect of the 
hawk in his head."

I moved to the north side of the altar, so that I was facing south to the airy 
side of the pyramid, and invoked the god kabexnuf, while holding my 
hands forward over the altar in the sign of the Enterer.

The god appeared, facing me across the altar. His head was that of a 
hawk, with a black nemyss, yellow and white coloring on his face, with a 
bit of black just above the beak, and his arms were tied to his sides within 
his wrapping/shroud.

I greeted him with the 5=6 signs. he did not respond in gestures, but 
instead spoke and said "Ol sonuf vorsag, goho Iad balata, elonusaha 
caelazod vonupeho." This is the first line of the first of the keys of Enoch.

He continued to recite the First Key as I tested him with the pentagrams, 
and he grew larger at their use. I told him that I was without understanding 
of why he had said the first of the keys, when this was one of the lesser 
tablets.

He completed his invocation and said: "Know, o man, that it would be to 
your great advantage if you would use the invocation of the First which is 
the Second in all your invocations of the tablets. This allows the forces to 
be under the presiding spirit of the gods, and therefore will your powers 
be exalted in the square you invoke. When you come unto us using only 
the lower keys and names, then you get less of an effect and the effect is 
more of the earthly trend, where we desire you to see those aspect of the 
squares that relate more to the spirit. 

"This is one of the many ways in which the use of the tablets can be 
varied in order to pick particular parts of the forces to see. As you saw in 
the square "M" of the Fiery Lesser Angle, each small variance in the 
attributes, though appropriate to the square, produces subtle changes in 
what is seen.

"Now, it is still too early to expect to get a clear vision within the full aspect 
of a square. Here within the pyramid we are protected somewhat from the 
force of the devourer, but without the pyramid, in the body of the square, 
then the devourer would return with full force.

"For the present, we wish to tell you of a few things of a more general 
nature that will help your work."

I said that I was amenable to this. He told me to get up and go to the 
bathroom so that I could listen in comfort. I did so.

"Now," says he, "you have wondered at the way in which your body 
seems to split itself into many parts in these visions, so that one seems to 
be the magician, and another the watcher, and yet another remains within 
the corpse [i.e. the physical body] in order to write what the others have 
seen. "

I acknowledged that this was the case, and said that it seemed to relate to 
Gemini on my nadir.

He said that this was in part true, though the effect was common one. "But 
in your case," he continued, "it is also an effect of your early working with 
the cards of Tarot. While shuffling the cards, you often found yourself out 
on another plane, receiving information that had nothing to do with the 
intent of the Tarot reading you were trying to do.

"In the course of your divinations, you suddenly would discover a flash of 
insight on some other subject coming into your mind. This was an unusual 
effect, and one that was of great use to you."

I agreed that this was the case.

"You also found yourself with an extra set of hands, on an astral level, that 
seemed to be feeling each card as it went by in the shuffle. What you 
were doing, all unknowing,  was using the cards as a meditation on the 
movements of the universe, its continual ebb and flow. And out of the flow 
you would snatch that which you needed. The readings themselves often 
turned out to be of no significance at all in comparison with what you were 
receiving in the other way.

"What you had actually done in this was to find a way of causing the great 
Plutonian force that is within you to concentrate itself in one spot, allowing 
your Neptune and Sun to go where they would among the levels of the 
plenum. Your Pluto being in the sixth house, which governs detail work, 
the acts of shuffling, with its fine motor control, produced a focus of the 
Pluto on the cards.

"This is why you often have difficulty getting what you need out of the 
cards. The Pluto, while it is forceful, tends to remove from the symbols it 
touches their significance, causing a loss of meaning."

"Now, as the Pluto went this way, so your Neptune went another, pulling 
from the great pool of information on the higher astral levels those things 
of spirit which were of most importance to your work at the time. The 
Neptune being in the eighth house, it could touch upon those things which 
are the heritage of all intelligent beings within the worlds of the spirit. I 
realize that you are trying to remember the name of Akasha, and so I say 
it here. 

"The akasha is the central pool into which all knowledge flows, and here 
in the airy lesser angle do many of the powers of the akasha originate. 
The Air of Earth is the etheric body, which as the lord of Bailey30 has said 
to you, is the main place of residence of the akashic powers. That is, all 
things are reflected in the etheric body, as they are in the akasha, and the 
akasha and the ether are one and the same in many ways. This is why is 
it needful for you to clean out your own body, by the stopping of the 
smoking, and of the drinking of sodas and sugary things. For that which 
can get into your own ether determines what things you can see in the 
greater ether of Akasha.

"Do not worry about the effects of withdrawal of these things. As you have 
already seen, even a slight reduction causes your body to demand a 
greater reduction. Let your body guide you, and you will have no more 
difficulty stopping than you have had with the stopping of smoking the 
ganga after a long period of intense use. Only a few days of irritation, and 
all will disappear. This is the best time to do this, for your body is 
undergoing the changes of Uranus, and a few more changes will pass 
unnoticed in the shuffle.

"Let your mind complete the use of these things with tonight, and 
tomorrow do not purchase any more of them. Clean your house of them, 
and hide all the paraphernalia. Then, when they are not before your eyes 
you will feel less of a desire for them. And shortly, there will be no desire 
at all, as you see those things that come in their stead.

"Now, as to the rest of this vision, let it not be recorded, but put it down 
only in your mind as we transmit things into it."

The vision suddenly cut off. I could not see the pyramid, nor could I see 
the god. Instead, I saw only darkness within the astral vision. Nothing 
more came to my mind, so I stopped and went to do other things.


12/15/85 3:10 pm

I attempted again to invoke the force of the square "Z" of the Airy Lesser 
Angle of Earth. 

As soon as I had decided to do this invocation, and before I actually did 
so, I got an image of myself as a hawk riding the air currents within a 
world that was completely of a yellow color, except for an implied 
blackness of earth, which was felt but not directly seen.

Within this world, I saw the pyramid in full color. The Enochian version of 
the letter Ceph was written on the top of the pyramid. I entered the 
pyramid, and saw the angel of the square there, ZabO. He told me that 
this was to be one of those visions that I would not see fully until after it 
was over, so that it could come through without the interference of my 
conscious mind, which is still under the influence of the Uranus transit.

(Only the vision of the outside of the pyramid was seen consciously. The 
rest was not seen until afterward. Meanwhile, in the conscious world, I 
had done the invocations. I began with the hexagram ceremony in its 
general form. Then I did a preliminary invocation of the gods and angels 
of the tablet and square, followed by a detailed invocation using the calls 
and the names.

(This invocation resulted in my consciously seeing the pyramid within my 
astral temple. I entered into the pyramid, and there called upon the angel 
of the tablet again, and upon the god of the square, Kabexnuv, who 
appeared. Being tested with the letters he did not fade or change, but at 
the same time, he did not act or make any remarks, and when I asked to 
see an image of the square, he replied that what I was seeing [i.e. the 
yellow world] was the image.

(I did not feel too comfortable with this, so I went to my office and set up 
my word-processor. As I began to write, the rest of the vision made itself 
known to me.)

The angel, previously seen unconsciously, was wearing a yellow robe, of 
the type used by the angels of the square vau of yod of heh final. Unlike 
them, his skin was of a lighter shade, looking like a caucasian with a 
sunburn. Sheets of flame appeared to enclose his feet. His eyes were 
dark and appeared to transmit meaning directly into mine. I could feel an 
intense force emanating from him. He wore an angelic tablet of earth 
around his neck on a chain, and in his hands were the sword of air and 
the wand of fire. The wand was pointed downwards, the sword held 
crosswise across his body. The relative positions of the weapons 
demonstrated their relative strength in the square, not their positions in 
the pyramid.

I did the 5=6 signs, and he answered by saying, "Hail to you, brave 
traveler, for entering into the quarter of Air within the Earth tablet. The 
signs with which I would answer you are those of Set, of Shu, and of the 
nameless god of fire, whose sign we showed you as the sign of sulphur 
within the Earth tablet."31 (He performed these signs as he spoke, and 
then performed the 5=6 signs.)

"Now, as you know you are still within the reach of the devourer god, and 
will be for some days yet, yet it may be that we can accomplish something 
of note in this place and time."

I said that I hoped that this would be the case.

"In the early days of these visions, you found that many of the things to be 
told you will always be beyond the reach of your conscious mind at the 
time you are told, and can only be seen by it in fullness after the fact of 
the appearance. This is due to the fact that your mind is of an earthy 
nature in its public expression, and this expression controls your reception 
to consciously given information, particularly as it tends towards the 
opposite extreme of Earth than that which controls in these Kerubic 
squares of the tablets.32 

"Thus, we must learn to bypass it in these ways that we are doing now, in 
order for your to receive the full force of the vision. In order to do this, we 
speak to you in or through a part of yourself that is not fully conscious. 
This does not eliminate the need for your conscious mind to become 
involved for the vision to be learned and absorbed fully into your ways of 
seeing. You need not fear that you open yourself to invasion by this 
technique, for while that part is not fully conscious, yet it still has the 
power of resistance of your full being, and can not be entered against 
your will.

"Now we have to work together to bring the vision into full awareness. 
Look you to the things in your mind at this time."

I saw that what was in my mind was a reminder of the dreams I had had 
the night before, which were of airships of a strange type, and of the 
travelling of persons on these ships to strange and far-away places. What 
I saw looked to be a summary of part of a dream which was much longer 
in its actual presentation.

The angel said: "These airships that you saw are the thoughts of men, as 
they view the world beyond their immediate location. They are the dreams 
of men who wish for something more than what they have, and who 
aspire to brings those things into the world, so that all may benefit from 
their use. These things may be of a machine nature, as are the airships, 
or they may be of a more subtle level, ideas, principles, creeds, things 
which affect primarily the minds of men, to bring them up a notch within 
the realms of spirit.

"These ideas are the manifestation in the mind of those things that 
received their force and form from the previous two quarters of this tablet. 
Now that they have been activated, and their principles encoded within 
the matter of those worlds, which is not the same matter as that of the 
physical earth, these things now have to come to be put into action within 
the world, through the minds of men.

"Before man came into being within the manifest world, these activities 
were the job or jurisdiction of those angels who are closest to man in 
nature, those of the element of Air. These angels gave parts of 
themselves into the quarter of Earth, so that the Earth could form itself for 
man's arrival. Now that you are here, these angels have gone back to the 
jobs for which they were originally intended, which do not relate to what 
we will see here today."

I waited for a moment, as the angel had stopped speaking, and appeared 
to be waiting for me to ask something. I decided to follow the standard 
G.D. method, and asked to see a scene that would explain the force of 
the square "Z".

I was lifted up by the angel, and taken to a place where the earth seemed 
to end in an abrupt drop-off, much as in the medieval pictures of the flat 
earth, with ships falling off its edge. The angel told me the flatness was a 
matter of convenience of description for purposes of the vision, and did 
not constitute the actual case on any level of existence.

Now the angel directed my attention to the air beyond the edge of this 
earth, which appeared to vanish into infinity. This air was blue, rather than 
the yellow of air in the King scale. The blue glowed slightly and the color 
itself appeared to have depth. The angel said this was the air called Ether, 
or Aethyr, which is the energetic air that stands above the gross matter of 
earth. Within this air I could see flashing lines of light, going here and 
there at great speed. These lines grouped themselves into patterns, and 
the patterns seemed to have a sort of unity to them, so that each group 
tended to stay in roughly the same general form, while changing itself in 
detail to respond to the other patterns with which it came into contact.

I asked the angel if the patterns represented the astrological patterns of 
some beings, this being my first impression of them. The angel told me 
that they did, among other things, reflect the astrological pattern, but that 
they also included a representation of every force that had impinged upon 
the being or thing at the time of its creation. So all things are a microcosm 
of the universe at their inception, varying only in the way the pattern could 
manifest within their concrete material form. Thus, the pattern of a rock 
carving is limited to those manifestations possible to rock, which were few. 
The patterns of living things reflected them ever more accurately as we 
moved up the evolutionary ladder, until we came to man, who held them 
fully within himself.

The angel said: "All things possess this aspect of the Air of Earth. They 
are all held and defined in the universe by this action of ether, which both 
distinguishes them from each other, and provides the connection between 
them.

"Now the rock, being of an extremely earthy nature, expresses the 
patterns of its etheric body primarily in the detailed crystalline or 
amorphous fine structure. The ways in which crystals are formed in it, and 
the ways in which it communicates with the others of its kind, are held 
down to the level of the basic earthy material. It can not adapt on its own 
to the changes of forces around it, but can only respond to the outside 
pressures of its area. If the area is one of great heat, as is the case in this 
square, then the rock is vaporized, and its pattern dispersed, to fall again 
upon the earth over a wide area. In this way are the characteristics of a 
particular area moved about the earth where they are needed. This would 
be the case in a volcano, when the ashes of the blow have fallen over the 
land around, making it more fertile than it was before, and clearing out the 
which was there to make way for new growth.

"As the physical rock moves from place to place as vapor in the air, it also 
carries with it in its etheric equivalent the whole of its history. Thus, when 
its parts land upon the earth again, no matter how widespread, the 
experiences it has had become part of the rocks in the new places, some 
of which may not have had similar experiences themselves. For example, 
the rocks in your own area of the world [north-central North America] are 
all of the sedimentary type, and have not seen the force of fire since the 
days of their formation. As the dust of the western volcanos falls here, it 
enriches the earth with its experience, giving to it the force of fire which it 
would otherwise lack.

"Now, you wish to move up a level, and see how this square works within 
the plant kingdom. Look you closely and see."

I looked in my vision, and saw a flowering plant, with six petals in a 
hexagon shape about two inches across. It was not a lily, for it was of a 
violet color, and seemed to not be as deep in its cup as a lily would be. I 
had seen something similar in my father's garden many times, but could 
not recall its name.

As I looked at the plant, there formed around it a sort of haze, with a 
network of lines or energy running through it. This haze reached out from 
the plant to touch other plants in the neighborhood, and I could see that 
their combined web of energy pulsed with a surprisingly regular beat. 
Then I saw another form of plant, red in color, in a patch next to the 
purple ones. These latter had six-sided blossoms like the first, except that 
they were on long stalks like asters, rather than being close to the ground. 
Each stalk was covered with blossoms.33

These red plants also had a haze around them, but the pattern of the 
lines in the haze was of a different detail structure. All the red plants also 
pulsed in unison with each other. It seemed as if the violet plants were 
saying "Here we are." and the the red ones replied, "And so are we here."

Now the angel said: "The plant kingdom is the most evolved of the 
manifest kingdoms of nature. They are all of a degree of initiation, within 
their own plan, that is much higher than that yet achieved by humanity. 
While each plant retains it individual identity, it is also fully and 
consciously a part of all other plants, particularly those of its own species.

"The pulses you see are the heartbeat-equivalents of the plants, the 
indication of their own internal cycles, expressed outwardly. With each 
pulse, they gather energy from the air about them, and incorporate it into 
their bodies, both physical and etheric. As the new energy comes in, they 
use that which it replaces to express outwardly their perfection of form 
and nature. Each one sings to the world of itself, and the world responds 
with its own singing.

"Each type of plant has its own note, its own special combination of 
energies. And within these combinations are many small variations that 
indicate the exact state of the plant, whether it is well or ill, growing or 
dying, safe or in danger. As it sings its note, its neighbors respond, and 
quickly are all within the area expressing in unison the conditions of 
each."

I could sense within myself a sort of singing note. It could not be heard, 
but only sensed, and it seemed to express a sort of geometrical perfection 
along the lines of the hexagram. But this perfection did not imply 
remoteness or coldness of feeling, but instead was a calling out of joy in 
being alive and being what it was.

"What you sense," said the angel, "is the note of those plants that I have 
shown you, singing out their happiness that they have been planted and 
nurtured by man. They sense that they are appreciated for their beauty, 
and this makes their joy an even greater thing than it is in itself. Let your 
self listen to it."

As I felt the note, a corresponding vibration began in my heart chakra. 
The force of the chakra went out to envelope me in a brief but 
overwhelming sense of joy. As the intensity lessened, I could get the 
sense of the singing.

It seemed that the plants were calling to the man who had planted and 
cared for them, expressing in their call the wish that he come and 
appreciate them some more. It also said that at least half of their joy was 
in the joy they gave to others, both through their physical beauty and 
scent, and through their provision of food to those who loved them. It 
bothered them not at all that they might end their lives cut from their roots 
and sitting in a vase on someone's table. In fact, it seemed that this was 
an end much to be desired. The plants lived to give themselves, and to 
them, to die out of time to provide beauty or life to another was better than 
to live their whole lives out and fall with the winter's snows.

"This is the true meaning of sacrifice." said the angel. "That the giving be 
in pure joy, untouched by the pains of life, uncaring of its own end, 
uncaring of the ends for which it is used, but solely for the fact of the 
giving. Plants are truly the children of the sun, and express his life-giving 
nature. For no matter how much is given, yet there is more to give. That 
sacrifice that is done in pain, or against the will of self, as the Many see 
the sacrifice of their God, is not sacrifice, but suicide.34

"In this, the plants are like unto the artist, who gives out of himself his 
creation, caring not whether it be taken by his fellows as good or bad, but 
only that it express fully that which it needs to express. Like the plant, he 
throws his being out into the world in the creative act. Like the plant, once 
his creation, his child, is separated from himself, it has its own life to live, 
and how that life is taken into the world becomes its own self-expression."

"Now, we have gone long into this thing of the plants, for their perfection is 
of an high order, and expresses fully that which is meant by the Fire of Air 
in the Earth. In no other kingdom would we have seen this so clearly as 
here.

"Understand that while the plants are perfect, this does not mean that 
their initiation will bring them to a higher spiritual level than man will attain, 
for each has its place in the scheme of the worlds, and each attains to its 
own perfection within its own place. Man is intended to be the conservator 
and caretaker of the earth, and the one who brings all the other lower 
types into even greater perfection. Even the plants can be made more 
perfect, for their internal perfection is that of natural growth, while the 
perfection that man places upon them through his breeding and cultivation 
is the perfection of Art, and of soul. We make them what they seek to be, 
which is the full expression of the soul in livingness.

"The animals too can achieve perfection, but for them, perfection means 
to become like unto those who breed them. Thus it is the evolutionary 
goal of all the lower kingdoms to become, in their own way, like unto their 
gods, which are man. 

"Man himself will achieve his perfection is his union with his soul. At the 
present time, only those few who have achieved it on their own, and 
become the Artist or Adept, are near to the natural perfection of man. And 
even they are withheld from its fullness by the conditions of the world 
under which they must express themselves. Thus they work ever to raise 
up others to their level, devoting themselves in their own ways and works 
to the perfection of humanity, so that their own expression can be of 
greater beauty.

"Those who do so through Art, or through the Magick of the Spheres, are 
only a few of those who seek this goal. Many would not consciously 
recognize that what they do points towards this goal, even if you told 
them. But the paths and ways by which man travels are as various as is 
man himself in his individuality, though each path is like unto others in its 
stopping points, no matter the form taken in a particular life.

"Now, let us go on to other things. All that we have seen here in these 
many images expresses fully the power of this square. The fire we have 
seen is still the life, as it was in the other quarters of the Wall [of Earth]. By 
the use of the Air, that is, the Ether, does the life distribute itself, both in 
the physical world, and in the mental worlds where so many men have 
their work. 35

"In the inner worlds, this distribution most frequently takes the form of 
communication, and what we are doing here at this moment is as much 
an expression of this square as is any part of the vision itself.36 Life 
expressed in communication passes itself from its creator unto the others 
of its creator's kind, infecting them with a little of his creativity, and 
bringing their own minds and hearts a little higher, showing to them things 
that they could not see for themselves. The Earth is the basis of the 
communication, and that which is communicated, for all the things we 
have seen and done are done within her sphere of action.

"How these acts and powers relate to her own initiation will be held for 
another time, for there is something more to say before we end this day's 
session, and I would wish you to relax for a few moments, and let your 
mind go to simpler things."

(I did so by reading over this account and correcting the typing errors. 
Then I went and lay down for a few minutes.)

I returned, and called upon the name of the angel again. The angel 
returned and said to me: "Now that you have rested, let us continue. I 
have come here to tell you of the things you requested, and as is usual, 
there is more to say than can be said in one trip, or on one subject. What I 
have to say now relates again to your own place in the scheme of things.

"You have seen in your visions and dreams of late that the method and 
position by which the forces of Mars and Venus in your astrological 
pattern express themselves is in the process of changing. The goal of this 
change is to give you the situation you want, both from the internal and 
the external standpoints. Internally, you wish that your philosophy become 
more of an art than it has been in the past, more expressive of the heart 
than of the head, while still holding to the immense effectiveness of your 
sun's position. Externally, you wish to be able to meet your complement 
and work with her without the internal pains that you usually meet with 
when dealing intimately with women. This latter effect, as you know, is of 
the position of Venus in Scorpio, semisquare to your sun. This position 
gives you an intense interest in love, while preventing you from 
expressing that love within the natural world.

"Now in order to change this effect, you have postulated that a position in 
Libra, sextile to your sun, would be of best effect, while changing your 
original pattern as little as possible. Putting Mars in conjunction with 
Venus would remove it from the direct effect of Saturn, and allow it more 
serious expression than can be had in the previous position where it was 
held.

"Both these things have come to pass for a few minutes at a time, and the 
time's duration has been increasing. Now you have a good conception of 
what the final effect will be like. The only things left to consider are 
whether you wish to make this change a permanent one or not. How you 
decide this will have an effect on your future work.

"The choices open to you are many more than simply the few you have 
tried to put into effect. There may be other full patterns, different from the 
ones you have held so far, that would be of more or better use at one time 
or another. To be able at will to change your pattern would be an even 
more desirable goal than to simply make a few changes in the pattern and 
then leave them."

I agreed that this would be an advantage, but that I could not see how I 
could determine whether a particular configuration would be desirable or 
not, while remaining at my present level of awareness. It seemed to me 
that at least there would have to be a Master of the Temple involved, who 
could see the whole thing from the outside. From the inside of the pattern, 
my judgment was too limited to make such an evaluation. Therefore, I had 
tried to choose the best pattern I could devise on my own, without making 
too many changes to evaluate. I asked if there was any other way to know 
these things, within my present limits.

The angel told me: "The cause of your limits is your tie to the incarnate 
body, and to the vehicles that contain it. To get out of them you would 
indeed have to be a Master, and that is coming soon to be your new 
position."37 38

"We speak of this now in order to set your mind to consideration of the 
possibilities. You have shown that you are able to act on the Master's 
level for at least short periods of time without loss of life or sanity, and we 
will assist you to see what you will from that level. This is for the 
immediate future. Eventually, you will be able to live on both levels at 
once, as was predicted so long ago, and at that time, such assistance 
would no longer be needed.

"If you would go to those levels now, simply strike your heart with the 
palm of your hand as you do your daily invocation of the light of the sun in 
the four quarters39, and we will assist you to get there. Now, do not 
expect that every time you will see consciously upon that level, for there is 
still the limitation of your current pattern to deal with.

"You are right in associating this act with the line about "Bes-na-Maut" in 
the Stele of Revealing, for that is an expression of the Babe of the Abyss, 
slowly growing larger within the womb of the mother, who, in this 
expression, is related to Saturn and to Binah. Thus, "By Bes-na-Maut my 
breast I beat" becomes "I arouse my heart to come to be a babe in the 
womb of Nuit." You should do this at the end of each ceremony, after the 
conclusion of the signs and before you leave the temple. Direct your mind 
to this tonight and see what occurs.

"Now as to the ordering of your life along the lines of your new pattern, I 
would advise you to continue to work as you have, directing your thoughts 
and emotions to the proper attitude, and thereby removing yourself from 
the old pattern and placing yourself in the new. Do not worry that you will 
find things changing without your knowledge. The time of pain and of life 
as a Hermit in the desert is closing, and now things will be shown to you, 
with their reasons, as they happen, for you to agree with or reject.

"That you have come so far in such a short time is nothing less than 
amazing to some among us here, for that which you wish to change, and 
have already changed once in full measure, is the very root of your 
existence as a man. Nothing else in manifest life is more difficult to 
change in its essential symbolism. But those who know you well knew 
from the start that you would succeed in this matter as you intended. For 
we have done to you in the past such a vile thing that many would have 
destroyed their spirits because of it. Yet you have come through it without 
so much as a lasting pain. The things that disturb you in this life are not 
the result of those things of the last life when you were betrayed. That, 
you have taken in stride. And for good measure have you begun again 
from the start and attained your old position, while in the process, you 
eliminated any possibility of the same sort of betrayal happening again. 
The cleverness with which you did this has distracted those lesser 
students in our group, so that they see not the full effect of your very 
subtle choices. 

"Now that you have begun to understand how this life relates to that last, 
you have found that many of the things that you thought to be the results 
of affliction are actually the solution to such affliction. (This is not the 
paradox it seems, o fellow students, for you see only the details, not the 
whole plan, even when you look into the mind of our brother here. He is 
more clever than all of us, even with his mind blocked from itself as it has 
been in this life.)

"I see you, o friend and mentor, with suspicion rising in your heart at my 
words. No doubt you will put them in the `unproven' category with the rest 
of such statements. But in your after-dream life40, you will know them to 
be true.

"Know ye that I who have spoken to you since your last break with this 
vision am not the angel who spoke before. No, I am not an angel at all, 
but one of those who is of your own type within the worlds of spirit. I am 
your student, and you are the master, though at this point it appears 
other-ways. Know ye also that in the end it will be I who will be upon the 
earth, as you are in the heavens at this time. Together, we will have 
between us the full force of our wills, combined in the process of 
revelation. To you, the knowledge of the greater forces. To me, the 
knowledge of the earth. And between us, we will show those who doubt 
that there is truly a world beyond their ken, which is waiting for them.

"I am the twin who was mentioned so frequently in your recent readings. 
Whether I am also the scarlet woman is a word you need not ask, for this 
is the case in one sense. Yet there is another who will be with you in flesh, 
who will boost your soul with her love to the heights. We three are one, 
though as yet this is not seen. Think of me more as if I were Harpocrates 
to your Ra-Hoor-Khuit, both of us together making the Crowned Child, 
Heru-Ra-Ha, who holds all things of Light and Life within himself.

"Before going to bed tonight, strike the breast and call upon me by the 
name with which you have known me, in the early days of this life's 
seeking. That name is as you have written and erased here.41 If you do 
this within your magick circle, you need not fear of any loss of self, or of 
any subterfuge intended to destroy you. That was never my intent, nor the 
intent of the others here who study you with wonder.

"I leave you now, and return to you the angel with whom you have 
explored this place. Call upon his name once more, and he will appear 
again in his own place."

I did so, calling upon all the names of the Tablet and Lesser Angle, as 
well as ZabO. The angel appeared again beside me, and said: "Those 
who wished to speak to you have returned to their observations, and now 
we may continue with the vision, if you wish."

I said that I did wish to continue for a little while, if he felt that the forces 
would continue long enough. But first, I requested that he move in front of 
me, so that I could see and test him again. He moved so, and I tested with 
the letters. He seemed to expand while remaining in place. I did the 5=6 
signs again, and he responded as he did in the first test, save that the 
traditional sign of fire was substituted for its specifically Earth-Tablet 
equivalent. I was satisfied that he was genuine, and not a product of my 
imagination.

But now, the force of the square seemed to be weakening. I asked the 
angel whether it was worth continuing at this time, and he said that it was 
probably better to let things go, and to come another day to deal with the 
next square. This being the case, I agreed that we should end here, and 
exited the pyramid.

In the temple, I banished the remaining forces, and returned fully to my 
body.

The vision, and this account of it, were ended at 6:30 pm.

12/18/85

Square "a" of the Airy Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.

I banished the forces from the temple, and invoked in turn the names 
NANTA, MOR DIAL HCTGA, ICZHHAL, ANGPOI, UNNAX, abOZ. The 
first, fifth, and thirteenth calls were used.

I visualized the pyramid of the square, standing about me. The north side 
was black, with the Enochian sigil of Earth drawn large in white, and the 
downward crossed triangle of earth written small above it. The east side 
showed the eagle drawn small, the water triangle drawn large. In the west 
the card Queen of Swords was drawn small, again the triangle of water 
was drawn large. In the south, the triangle of air in violet on the yellow 
background.

I entered into the pyramid, and there I saw the sphinx, with his bull's head, 
eagle's body and wings, and man's legs. He said to me: "Entered you 
have into another holy place, o man, for you have come from fire unto 
water, in the air of earth. Call upon the god of the square, and he shall 
appear."

I called upon Tmoumathph, the god of the pyramid.

He appeared, showing his jackal's head in black, with yellow nemyss and 
black, blue, and yellow stripes on his shoulders. I performed the 5=6 
signs, and as I did so, I entered into the body of the god. He responded by 
doing the 5=6 signs. I could see myself across the pyramid, doing the 
signs again, and doing the pentagrams to test him. As I did so, the body 
of the god grew ever larger, expanding beyond the bounds of the earth.

I asked the god to show me a scene that would demonstrate the power of 
the square, but he declined to do so, saying: "It is best that you wait upon 
these things, o man, for the forces about you are stirring, and that which 
you would see here is troubled by these things. Let us stay with simple 
things tonight, and another night we will explore the square in its detailed 
manifestations."

I said that this was all right. The image did not seem as strong as the last 
few times I explored the squares, and I felt that we might not go too far 
with what energy was available. I asked the god Tmoumathph what he 
wished to do instead, if he did not wish me to leave the vision 
immediately.

He said: "Let us consider the things that you have seen so far in the 
squares of the Tablet of Earth. You have been through two angles fully in 
the Kerubic squares, and now you begin to redress the balance by doing 
the others here of air and earth.

"Now, in the first two stages [angles] of the larger vision which is your 
magickal project, you were shown how the powers of fire and water 
manifest within the earth. The fire was shown to be the life, and the water 
was shown to be the giver of form and perpetuation and nurture to that 
which the life dictates to appear. Now in the airy angle we are seeing how 
these things, these impulses and forms, will come into the mind-function 
of the earth, preparing it so that the final manifestation, in the angle of 
earth, will be of full power. Here we deal with the son as air, where you 
have seen in the other places the sun as fire.

"You are, in fact, passing through the stages of an initiation ritual by your 
travels in these squares of the Earth Tablet. At each stage, certain ideas 
must be given to you and expanded upon. These are not necessarily the 
most usually seen aspects of the squares invoked, and in many cases are 
rarely seen in this context. But nevertheless, they are still of the squares 
and angles invoked." 

The god looked at me with eyes like glowing yellow coals, and gestured to 
the western wall of the pyramid. Upon it, an image began to form. 

"Look you to the wall of water of air, and see that which is there." I looked 
and saw the wall turn orange. As it did so, I was ejected from the pyramid, 
and rose up through the levels of the planes until I came to an image that 
I had seen before in other circumstances. Here, I was standing in a glade 
on the edge of a small river, much like the tame and placid rivers of 
England, with bright grass coming up to their shore. Upon the far bank, 
dark forests ran away to the north. To the left, the river curved north and 
passed out of sight behind the forest. To the east, the glade was 
separated from a larger field by a small stand of trees, seeming to be 
poplars or aspens from this angle.

Beyond the trees in the far distance, I could see a castle, built up upon a 
small mound above the edge of the river. I went forward to the castle, and 
suddenly found myself upon its battlements. Looking down into the river, I 
saw all manner of small boats, coursing back and forth, and within them 
were lovers of many physical types, but always a man with a woman in 
complementary pairs. The boats seemed aimless in their wanderings, but 
at the same time I knew that the aimlessness was actually their purpose.

The god said: "These are the people of the first two angles, now that you 
have united them in your minds. Between them they are forming the 
thoughts of the child to come. That child is yourself as you hoped and 
wished to be."

"Now come with me into the castle, and we shall see the temple that you 
have here."

We entered into the castle, and quickly came to a large room, a library by 
appearance, that overlooked the lake from which the river came, which 
was beyond the castle to the east. I examined the walls of the room, and 
saw them to be filled with many scrolls and old, large, bound books, in 
which the secrets of my past lives had been written in detail. I do not know 
how I knew this was what they contained, for I did not open them.

The god said: "You know the books' contents, because this is where you 
have left the images of your last lives yourself. It is not the creation of 
myself, or of any other god, but of your non-incarnate self, which left this 
place here as a signpost for your further journeys.

"As to how you will read these books, go you to the wall, and choose one 
at random, and we shall see." I turned to the right of the window, and 
suddenly was separate from myself, watching myself pull out a large 
bound volume with a blue cover.

"This is the record of your lives in Atlantis, which are again recorded in 
that other place of similar name which you went to to worship so long 
ago.42 Touch you the bindings at their edge."

I did so, and the book opened. Upon the pages within, I could see many 
small, detailed pictures, as I had once seen in another vision. The images 
were like little television screens, oblate rectangles, if there is such a 
thing. I touched one of the images, and it seemed to spring to life before 
my eyes.

Within the image, there was a young boy, seeming about ten to twelve 
years old, not yet reached puberty. In his hands he held a crystal of 
quartz, which he was trying to use as a divining mechanism. The images 
he could get were random, and did not seem to fit what he was looking 
for, yet he was fascinated by them just the same.

I heard the the child was myself, in the youth of my time upon the earth. 
"The child was not of low evolvement however, for his soul had come to 
the world from another place, solely for the purpose of making the mind of 
man into a stronger and more responsive instrument for man's purposes. 
His ideas about the use of the crystal were the first stirrings of the concept 
of the scientific method within the human sphere. Though not developed 
in the manner we have it now, for the men of Atlantis lived almost wholly 
upon the astral levels, and did not see the earth of which we now are 
aware. Their bodies were those of primitive ape-like man-beings, while 
their spirits, working partially outside the body, lived the meaningful 
portion of life upon the astral planes, giving to the body its energizing 
spirit, but taking little from it save for the anchor to the earth it provided. 
The concrete mind of the man was not yet developed, and here you were 
attempting to use it.

"At yet another time within that time of the world, this same boy, now a 
man, was killed by those who did not understand that he was the avatar of 
an outside force sent to help man. This was his first death at the hands of 
his fellows.

"In the following life, through the pains the body had experienced in that 
real death that also killed the astral self, the boy came into another life as 
a man of the spirit, persisting in his work despite what had been done to 
him. 

"Yet again, he worked with the crystals, for they were the key to 
concretizing the thoughts. By thinking up analogical relations between the 
astral crystals, and those real crystals with which the earth was full, he 
established a link between the astral reality and what we now call the 
mundane reality. But yet again was he betrayed by his fellows, who felt 
what he did, but did not understand it, thinking only that he was conjuring 
demons to harry and destroy them. They did not comprehend the physical 
world, for to them it was the merest shadow appearing in their dreams as 
their physical bodies went through the struggle for life within the earth. 
The earth to them was the denial of the beauty of the astral where they 
lived, and believed that all life was. For where in their usual life on the 
astral plane they could create the life as they wanted it, there in the 
physical world they could not do as they wished, but must conform 
themselves to the demands of the earth, limiting themselves only to the 
things and experiences which appeared there. Surely this was hell, from 
their limited viewpoint. And yet again, they killed his body through the 
bodies which held them to the earth, and caused his spirit to go from 
them.

"In the next life, the man, having survived his childhood despite his 
strangeness, decided upon another tack to get the eyes of men to look at 
the world on which they lived. He went to those worlds himself, and 
brought back tales of strange and unusual places, putting the descriptions 
in such terms of adventure that he hoped men would follow him out of 
interest and ego, where they would not follow out of understanding. He 
challenged them, calling them cowards, afraid to face the things that he 
himself faced without fear.

"Many men scoffed at him, and told him that his adventures were all made 
up, and that no such place could exist as he had described. For was not 
the world fluid, and full of light? And the places to which he went were 
dark to their eyes, having none of the astral in them.

"But that is the challenge!" he replied. "To look upon those things that are 
not of this world, and to live with the looking. Are you not satiated with this 
place of feelings that are nearly always as you wish them to be? Would 
you not rather gain strength and place by taking on something outside of 
your own little worlds? For there is nothing in this world of yours that will 
ever advance you beyond the state where you are now, but in that place 
is the hope of becoming a god."

"Yet again, the men scoffed. But a few, intrigued by his words, did look for 
themselves, and saw that indeed this place was one of great power, for it 
would stay as it was despite the greatest will they could exert upon the 
astral. Thus was the attraction to earth spread from man to man, and 
man's great fall from innocence began. Things lasted upon that plane of 
earth, and therefore could be possessed. That which they had upon the 
astral was ephemeral indeed, compared to the least of these things of the 
manifest earth.

"And so the man, and those who believed with him, and saw him at his 
work within that world, did begin the long fall into matter. Life after life, 
they concentrated their power upon that lower plane, using it as a base for 
their work in the astral, making their power in the astral so great that the 
others, who had not wished to follow them, were forced by their attraction 
[that of the man] to come down into the earth as well. The man had 
opened a door into hell, and all must now fall through it.

"Because the majority of those who fell did not do so through their own 
efforts, but through the reflexive response to the call of the pioneers on 
that plane, they felt as if they had been torn from their homes, that they 
had lost all of what had been beautiful in life. They had no choice, and 
therefore in their minds did their lost astral existence come to resemble a 
paradise, a Garden of Eden. And the man, who had tricked them into 
coming to this place against their intent, they perceived to be evil. And 
therefore did they describe him in terms of devils, and horrors, and of 
things of the lowest of the earth in which they now lived. And this memory 
did they carry from life to life, even unto the present day, calling him the 
snake, and the master of evil, when in fact his work was that of making 
fools into gods.

"Now the despoilation of the original astral culture of man, which was that 
of Atlantis, the living in the great sea of the akasha, was indeed a fall from 
grace. Yet it was a necessary fall, for without it man would not have the 
possibility opened to him to become ever greater than he was. For it is the 
friction of the soul with the earth that gives the man the power to rise up 
above the earth. The connection to the physical, with its great resistance, 
is the key to applying the power that is in man, to rise up through the 
planes to the place from which he was sent, by the gods who sent their 
seed into matter, to become as themselves.

"In time and space, the man could not be distinguished from his fellows, 
and therefore was he relatively safe from them. No longer could they find 
out which of them was the devil, so that no longer could they kill him in 
their revenge for his great service to them. This was the irony of them, 
that they could only see him for what he was when they saw him on the 
astral levels, and rapidly it was becoming impossible for them to do so. 
The upper levels of the astral where they had had their lives before time, 
were now closed to them by the earthyness of their beings. And so, only 
the memory of the great fall remained with them, unconnected to him who 
was the creator of their fall.

"Now, in doing this great service to man, the man also did a great service 
unto the gods, for to have men in full incarnation in the world of matter 
extended their own powers down to that plane, where before their 
creations had just lived within the astral levels, dying as soon as their 
creator removed his power from them. With the advent of man in the 
earth, the gods could now use him as an anchor for their creations, 
working them out in matter at the same time that men worked out their 
own individual destinies within that world. Thus the creations of the gods 
gained duration and strength, by becoming fully manifest.

How this came to be, that this man did come to earth to do these things? 
For it was not within the men of the earth at that time to be able to enter 
wholly into the earth-level. Therefore was it needed that one might come 
from elsewhere, to do the job that must be done. And not one only, but a 
multitude, yet this one was of a subtle nature, that led him to succeed with 
the first, opening the way for the others to come in and do greater things 
after him.

"You ask where the elsewhere was from which this man came? That I 
may not say at this time, for it is one of the things that must be had as part 
of the initiation again into spirit. Suffice to say that this one came to the 
earth via the life of Sirius, who was god to those who came before. That 
he did not originate there, or did, I can not say at this time. But wait, and 
you shall see.

"I realize that this vision of this day, with its many mistakes and errors 
[that is, typographical errors], seems to you to be weaker than those that 
have come before. Yet this is not the case, for you are reaching again into 
a long-lost place, and therefore does the power expend itself in holding 
you there. Close now the book, and choose another one."

I closed the book, and asked that it be returned to its place, for I could not 
see an empty place on the shelves before me. I willed it to return, and it 
vanished from my hands.

I looked about the shelves again, and saw another book, high up in one 
corner, that appeared to glow with a sort of brightness. Its cover was red, 
and upon it were the words: ALHIM GBVR, god of might.

Now, I opened this book in the way of the other one, touching its binding 
along the edge. And it opened to me to reveal another scene, this one of 
a man, sitting in a room of a country estate, reading of the things that 
occurred in far places. I understood that this one was the good doctor 
Dee, who did recite of the things of the spirit in the times of Elizabeth, 
giving to her the magick of the spheres to aid her in the work of 
governance. Therefore did he study long and deep on those things that 
would be of aid to the progress and health of his country, looking always 
to the advantage to be gained, not for himself, but for her who he loved, 
the child who must rule men of arms. 

He was younger here than in the pictures I had seen of him, and I 
understood that as yet his Queen had not come to her throne, and he 
himself was still of the age of early manhood. Yet his mind quested ever 
outwards, both into the world of men and the world of the spirit. He 
sensed about him those things which would later come to be the basis of 
his great contribution to the magicians, that system of magick by which 
this very vision was called forth from the grave. But as yet, it was only a 
sensing, unformed and unattainable, and his dissatisfaction led him ever 
to explore to the limits.

But now, in that time, there came one who should have been his friend, 
and was not, for he betrayed him greatly, and did him harm that no man 
should have. This one, who he admired for his great strength of vision, did 
ask of him that he accompany him to the continent of Europe, and there 
explore the ways of men.

These two men, much alike as to power, much different as to morals, did 
travel together unto the eastern end of the continent of Europe, unto the 
great capitol of the days of Constantine, and there did the mix with the 
men of other faiths, looking in those faiths for the keys that seemed to be 
lacking in their own. Among the persians there did they meet one who had 
known of them in other times, and to them did he give the secrets of the 
ways of using the planets in the determination of the skills and powers of 
men. For in their own place this art was of low skill, and the practitioners 
mainly charlatans, not worth the steel to run them through. And this man 
was known to them as haroun al raschid, who later became known for 
other things under another name than this one he had adopted from his 
homeland's tales. Of that other name we do not speak, yet he was of the 
greatest in his own time as that other had been in his.

Now Dee used the ways he had learned cunningly in later years, keeping 
the queen's men well-appointed to their places, combining his knowledge 
of the needed skills of government with his knowledge of men's souls, to 
advise on who should be what within her court.

In this later day you maintain the same interest, though at a lower level, 
because there are other things to do in this life, and other ways to use 
than that one which has done you so well in the past lives. For did you not 
make an art in one time of the very things that this man of the east had 
taught to you? Did you not select for your own magick those who 
exemplified that quality of spirit which was a particular planet? and did you 
not put these into position as to have them interact in the special ways of 
the planets that you knew?43

Now, look further within this book of strengths, and you will see that in 
other lives yet, was your power of astrology made manifest, even unto 
that life in which the standing stones brought you up into the stars by their 
force. Look now, turn the pages, and select another.44 

I turned the pages, and found another scene before me. This one of a 
copse of willows, growing by a stream in the south of America, light on a 
spring day, with grass growing greenly, and the heat not yet of its summer 
temper.

Yet as I looked, the force of the vision weakened, and I felt that it would 
not take me much further in this vision. I waited, and could not see more 
than this one image.

Then the god said: "Now here we have another sort of strength, that of 
love. In the springtime of this year, which here is in the 1840's, are you 
seated with your love in the Georgia sun, waiting for that time when you 
must return to the houses of your parents. This girl, this woman, caused 
you in later years to become a man of strength, by her confidence in that 
strength that she felt and no one else saw. She tempered your strength 
with her gentleness, changing it from the impetuous and rambunctious 
energy of youth, into the calm, mature energy of the man who knows his 
intent and sets to do it. She did not lead you in your way, but only 
encouraged you to the value of your own life, where that life was unfitted 
for the times in which you lived. 

"For still did you retain the image of the spirit in front of your eyes, and 
hoped in some way to bring it into the world. This girl caused you to 
become a minister, and to go west into the lands of the indians, there to 
proselytize. Yet after you got to the lands, you found that within the spirits 
of those indians was a power greater than that of the god who you served, 
and you needs abandon that god in the taking up of what they had to 
show. Yet still did your girl, your wife and lover of long standing, 
encourage you in what you did, for she knew that you were of the spirit, 
and could not be led away from the path that you saw. 

In this time and place did you meet the one who in later times you knew 
as David Railly, who then was in the bodies of his ancestors, and did 
know also in that time the ways of the spirits. You worked with him, and 
yet you felt apart from him, then as in that later life, when you two did 
initiate yourselves by your coming together upon the mountain of stone. 
His life was of such joy, that you, with your greater burden of guilt and 
restlessness, could not understand his attitude, even when you felt the 
spirit reaching from him into the heavens. Sadly you left him, and returned 
to your own kind, yet in you was that connection which later caused you to 
be drawn together again. This too was a strength, for you knew from him 
in a way that others could not show you that the spirit comes to all men in 
their own way, and none can show another his path, no matter how great 
his own achievement. You still carry this with you to this day, along with 
that sense of love that caused you such sadness at your lack of 
communion.

Now do you come to this place again tomorrow, and we will take up things 
of another kind, leaving this thing of the past lives until you are able to 
remember more on your own. That last life of which you speculate we will 
not cover here, save to say that there is much more to the betrayal in that 
life than you have yet fathomed, and much more to the conquest that you 
gained from overcoming it.

I closed the temple and returned fully to my body.
--------------------------------------------------

A Vision of the Square "a" - Water of Air of Earth. 

12/20/85 Begun at approximately 7.30 pm.

Angel of the square: abOZ. 
God of the square: Tmoumathph.

I invoked the spirits of earth, and the spirits of the lesser angle. The 
pyramid appeared, emblazoned on the north with the enochian sigil of 
earth, on the east and west with the sigil of water, and on the south with 
the sigil of air.

A voice said: "The father has spilled his seed into the air, and the mouth 
of the mother has caught it up, giving it into her womb to breed."

"Here in the square "a" of the airy lesser angle, do the fires of the spirit of 
aethyr give their life unto the forms which they intend to create within the 
manifest world. For without the waters, the form would fall, and never rise.

"Now, if you would see more of this angle, call upon the angel of the 
square again, with all your will."

This was done, vibrating the name abozod so that the vibration filled the 
pyramid, and went out into the universe through its top. The angel 
appeared, wearing the black nemyss of the Earth, with a light colored 
shoulder patch45, and the robe itself of a dark blue color, with the green 
of earth around the edges, and an inner lining of the yellow of air. His hair 
was dark, yet there was a silvery sheen to it, as if the moon reflected from 
its surface.

I did the 5=6 signs to the angel, and called upon him to show the signs of 
his power. He spoke, saying "Set, Shu, Auramoth, The Rending of the 
Veil, The Closing of the Veil." He performed the signs in question as he 
said this. Being tested with the letters, he proved genuine by showing no 
effect.

I asked him to show me a scene representative of the square.

He said: "Know ye, o person of might, that here in this square do we take 
the fires that were given into the air of the earth, and make from them the 
foundation of the patterns that will dictate their form within the material 
world. For here is the place where the spirit of ether46 gathers round itself 
those pieces of matter that are to be the final form, and builds from them 
the form itself. So that the darkness in which we stand, within the pyramid, 
is called the womb of the earth, and all within are the children of earth, as 
are we ourselves.

"Now look you to the east and west, where the waters meet the fire and 
the air." [That is, where the energies come from the square "Z", and leave 
to the square "b".]

I looked to the east, and there saw the side of the pyramid, rippling 
upwards. In the center of it, the sigil of water was undisturbed, yet there 
seemed to be a feeling of something hard and shiny hidden within it. 
Looking closer, I saw a capsule, again like the encapsulated lives of fiery 
angle of earth, which had forcefully buried itself in the wall of the square. It 
caused the side to bulge inward slightly but increasingly, so the the sigil 
bowed inwards towards the center of the circle within the pyramid. (There 
was a magickal circle formed unnoticed by the angel as I had observed 
the wall.)

Looking to the west, I saw that there the wall was bowed as well, with the 
sides becoming increasingly inward as I watched. Yet on this side there 
were no capsules imbedded, but only a patina, or sheen of white spread 
over the side of the pyramid.

I sensed that I was not seeing this western side completely, and told the 
angel so. He said, "Indeed, you are not seeing all. Go you to the outside 
of the pyramid."

Doing so, I saw that on this side, the wall did bulge outward. There was a 
bulge exactly the size of the circle around the sigil, and within it I could 
see a milky liquid, as if whitish-yellow particles were suspended within the 
water.

As I watched, the sigil burst, and sent out into the air a burst of white fluid, 
which bathed the air with light. The angel by my side said: "So that the 
form does not disintegrate, it must again be released from the waters, 
going back into the air of ether. Now that it has done so, the seeds which 
came from the fire are multiplied, and are therefore of more scope and 
potency than when they entered."

"Now these seeds are not the sort of seeds that plants give, but the sort of 
seed that is in semen, many things of a certain type, which will continue 
on and fertilize the mother's daughter, who is herself. It is the 
multiplication of the impulse that shows itself in this square. For the 
original impulse, no matter how potent, is without power until the waters 
take it and preserve it in their womb.

"Go ye to the other side, where the fire enters into the waters, within the 
air of earth."

I saw that where the inward bulge of the east side had been, there was 
now, from the outside, seen a capsule of fiery airs, glowing and swirling 
while keeping their shape. This capsule could not dissolve itself in the 
waters, and therefore its pressure did push the side inwards. Suddenly, 
the side collapsed, and the capsule spread itself out among the ruins. But 
then the side reconstructed itself, and ate up the capsule, sending its 
potency throughout the square.

The angel said "Now where the mother is virgin, as is the case here, due 
to her airy47 aspect, she needs to have the force of the male power to 
break her open, and to give to her the impetus to perform her duties of 
creation and preservation. This is the virgin moon, who is reflected in my 
hair, and in my eyes. For there is a mystery here of the mother, that she is 
always so, yet seems to change as her life evolves.

"In the course of this penetration, the waters do generate within 
themselves the action of response, so that without the man, she would be 
barren and lacking in the sensitivity to do her job. But given his power, 
she conquers the man, and goes on to produce out of herself many of his 
kind, after her own fashion, which is to reflect it in a myriad of ways. This 
is how the power is enabled to work within the earth. For its main potency 
is without effect, unless that potency can be reduced in scope, and given 
over to a concentration within small spaces. Her distribution of the power 
causes every small piece to be as the father, yet at the same time, it 
keeps itself to a smaller area, and gathers to itself those types of matter 
with which it is compatible. Many children of one father does she produce, 
yet all are themselves of the father, and all together do make up the father 
within the daughter.

(I think the word "reduced" is here used in the logical sense. That is, a 
reduction to essential components, rather than a shrinking or lessening of 
force.)

"Now look you to the south side of the square, where the airs do lie and 
keep themselves."

I looked to the south side of the pyramid, and saw that there, the angel 
had put up the sigil of water, within the center of the sigil of air, and that 
the waters were themselves distributed about through the air.

The angel said "Here we see that the airs are themselves their own water, 
as the air of earth acts as its own father and mother, self-producing after 
the manner of its kind. And as the fire and water produce the air, so does 
the air produce the earth, which is the north side of the square. How this 
is done will be seen in the action of the ether when it is pulled together in 
an act of creation.

"The waters of the mother of the watery lesser angle did produce out of 
themselves a pattern, which determined the forms that the creation of the 
fiery angle could take within the sphere of the earth of malkuth. Now these 
patterns, in themselves, are of a fiery nature with respect to the airy part 
of the earth, so that they entered out of Heh final of Heh of Heh final, into 
the Yod of Vau of Heh final, as a fire, rather than as an earthy thing. This 
is of course due to the rotation of the elements within each sub-angle.

"Now the patterns entering here are of a specific, almost mathematical 
nature, giving the parameters which will determine the specific limitations 
and activities of the final creation. These patterns, still very abstract, have 
to be converted to a form which is closer to the actual functioning of the 
earth of malkuth, in which the creation will manifest itself.

"Let us see again what happens when the patterns entered into the 
square "Z" of this lesser angle.

"Within those previous visions of the square Z, things were shown on a 
more abstract level than we are dealing with here, due to the increase [in 
vibration] that the devourer creates within those things he touches. But 
still within it are the elements of what we wish to see. For you noted at the 
beginning of that vision that the fires kept themselves to very consistent 
groupings within the air, that is, they reflected in an organized way the 
energies involved in their creation.

"But at the same time, these energies were of a high, abstract level, and 
could not in themselves express anything of the forms of matter. They 
were like unto the energetic patterns that you see in the [astrological] 
charts of individuals. These energies have to be translated, as it were, 
into the sort of form that can actually exist on the material level in an 
enduring way. Like the sacrificial desires of the plants, their action 
depends on something outside itself to make it come into effective 
manifestation. 

"This is the function of the waters of the airy lesser angle. The waters take 
into themselves this impulse-pattern, and by reflection create within 
themselves many small copies out of the main energies. As the ripples in 
physical water always reflect the essence of the force that caused them, 
so do these tiny copies still reflect the force of the major impulse, and so 
are the waters reproducing in their own fashion the impulse itself. 

"These tiny sons of the father are in themselves incomplete, though they 
reflect his potency. To make themselves work correctly, they must band 
together, and the matter they gather must fall into larger patterns, so that 
their minuscule actions, taken together, add up to one larger event, which 
is the creation made into water's form. thereby do they preserve the 
impulse, which, of its own, would not have lasted within the earth.

"These minuscule lives are of a lower level of the astral-etheric vibrations 
than was the original impulse, yet one can go from an observation of 
them, to an exact knowledge of the force that produced them. This is 
somewhat as you do with your Sagittarian examination of experience, 
going from the particular to the general, and from the general to the 
divine. But that is the reverse of the process seen here, and pertains to 
another square, in another tablet. You shall see that in due time.

"For now, let us return to our narrative.

"Once the forces have been formed and preserved, that is, given duration, 
by the waters, then the waters eject them into the next square, the square 
"b", which is the air of air of earth. There they form the pattern which is an 
exact energy-duplicate of the eventual manifest thing, the etheric body 
proper of the person or thing created. This energy body acts as the driver 
and holder-in-organization of the physical object, which is the daughter.

"The daughter in turn creates the fires of matter,48 the electrical impulses 
and inter-atomic bonds that hold the matter together, and allow it the 
appearance of working on its own plane as the ethers do on theirs.

"This is the end of the narrative. Now if you wish to see more of this 
square within the worlds, ask of me and I will show you.

I asked to be shown the effect of this within the mineral world.

I was taken to a place where the waters of an ocean were struck by 
lightning. This caused the dissolved minerals within the ocean to form 
chemical compounds more complex than those they had previously 
formed. The angel said that this was in effect the way in which manifest 
life began on earth, with the energy of the sun, and of the torrential 
electrical charge of the early earth, producing the building blocks out of 
which the proteins that are the basis of life were created, the amino acids. 
The acids are in a sense the translation of the lightning into form. These 
acids spread throughout the water, and eventually were taken up into 
more complex compounds, giving to them their ability to switch places 
with each other while maintaining form, and allowing the production of the 
protein templates, from which the self-reproducing proteins came.

The angel continued: "On a higher level, man shows this force in the 
creation of languages, which are usually small components, meaningless 
in themselves, but which, when put together with others of their kind, 
produce an expression of meaning in matter. The original idea, which is 
an impulse within the brain of man, is shattered, and its shattered 
elements are used to select those language components needed to 
express the idea verbally. These elements then are put together into 
words, and the speech, which is air, produces effects in matter, through 
its effect on that at which they are directed.49

"You might also connect this force with the action of Virgo, within that 
version of the Tree of Life which you use. That path connects Geburah, 
which is the manifest energy-pattern, with Hod, which is the intellect. Virgo 
takes the energy pattern, and selects out of it smaller units having enough 
self-coherence to survive on lower levels. These units are symbolized by 
the Yod which is the basis for the Tarot card. The Hermit is a man who 
can live by himself, without the need of or aid of his fellow men. Thus also 
do these separated parts of the pattern need to be able to live on their 
own, separate from the pattern from which they came, in order to be able 
to express themselves in the limited ideas of the intellect. 

"This has been amply demonstrated elsewhere, both in your own work 
and in the works of others whom you know. Though it is not so clear in 
some as it is in others, yet the idea remains the same.

"Now, we have finished this presentation, and if we wished to go on then 
we would have to, in essence, start the demonstration over again, but 
within a slightly different viewpoint. You have done a good job of invoking 
the forces tonight, and there seems to be enough force to continue for a 
while, but I would suggest that you leave this extra energy and allow 
yourself to absorb it. Do the sign of the god Hoorpokrati, and we shall 
see."

I did so, and also felt that there was much energy left, but I also felt that 
there was not enough to carry us through the leap to another perspective, 
while still leaving enough to go through another presentation. Therefore I 
called upon the God MOR DIAL HCTGA to banish the remaining force 
that I could not absorb, thanking the angel meanwhile for his aid.

He said "Now that we have been together, we shall always have some 
connection to each other. I hope that in the future, we here can be of use 
to you again, for you are of the kind who seeks knowledge and 
understanding, and it is for this that the gods did create us here. Go ye 
about your business, and we who are here will aid you as we are able in 
your work. Thank us not, for we are also understanding of the meaning of 
true sacrifice, which is full-hearted giving without expectation of return, 
and so do we act, as you have acted in attempting to gain and give out 
the knowledge you have gained to others, without expectation of 
understanding or return. Go ye with the gods. Iaida!"

"So it is ended."

The force of the square suddenly weakened around me, and I returned 
fully to my body.

Ended at 8:53 pm.
---------------------------------------------------
Square "b" of the Airy Lesser Angle
of the Earth Tablet

12/21/85 

This morning I was considering whether to invoke the next square in this 
series, the square "b". Shortly after I did this, and without any conscious 
invocation of the square, I found myself in its pyramid. The pyramid 
showed the colors and sigil of earth on the north, and the colors and sigil 
of air on the other three sides, as was appropriate.

A voice said: "The winds do blow throughout the quarters of the earth, 
making of man the instrument of the Gods. One, touched by the wind, 
reveals the sound of an  harpstring, another, the mellow note of the 
bassoon, another sounds forth with flaring trumpets. To themselves, the 
sounds around may appear cacophonous, yet within all the orchestra 
there is harmony."

"Indeed, when the orchestra is heard whole, only one chord does sound, 
and that chord is the silence which is speech."

I took this to mean that humanity as a whole is the expression of the life of 
some being of another order, which being, discovered through abstraction 
from his manifestation, is of a single nature.

The voice continued: "Though you have not invoked us fully, yet we have 
come, to tell you that this is the time of your greatest knowing. Soon ye 
must pass again into unknowing for a while, but not before ye have 
finished this tour."

I asked whether they meant my tour of the earth tablet, or only of this 
lesser angle.

"Verily, it is the tablet as a whole which is the tour. But I refer to the 
completion of the Lesser Angle, in this instance. Our stopping here is 
simply a night's rest upon the journey, with another day of travel yet to 
come and go ere the journey be finished.

"Now, to some, it may seem as if we are here traveling through a realm 
which they know well. Yet this is not so, for as you have seen in another 
place, these tablets are infinite in their variety, as is fitting to the body of 
the mother of all. `Age can not wither, nor custom stale...'. 

"Go ye about your business today, knowing that in the heart of the day is 
the key to the square, and this will be shown to you in fullness when ye 
invoke this square with full intent, be it tonight, or another time, as ye 
deem."

I asked if there was anything else to be said at this time, and was told 
there was not.

12/21/85 4:00 pm

After purifying the temple with fire and water, and invoking the powers of 
earth, I did the keys of the tablet and lesser angle, and called upon the 
names, ending with the name of the angel of the square, bOZa, and the 
name of the god of the square, Aroueris.

The pyramid formed about me, again showing the sides as in the previous 
vision today, but the sides also showed the triangular sigils of the 
elements, as well as the enochian sigils.

I called again upon the angel and the god, and both appeared. bOZa was 
shown wearing all yellow, except for his nemyss, which was black, and his 
head, which was also black, and had a bull-like cast to it.

Aroueris appeared wearing the crown of the north and south, in the colors 
yellow and violet. His face and arms were the dark green of beetle's 
wings, and his neckpiece and apron were of violet and yellow 
respectively.

Before I could ask, or do the signs myself, he did the signs of the Rending 
of the Veil, of Set, of Shu, and the Closing of the Veil. Being tested with 
the letters he glowed a bit brighter, but was not otherwise affected.

From somewhere came a voice, saying "Glory, glory, glory are the sons of 
the father, and those who are of their nature. For they spread upon the 
earth the seed of the father, and make the earth to become as its mother."

There seemed to be a sort of blue radiance in the air within the pyramid. 
The god Aroueris told me that this was the material transmitted to the 
square from the previous square of the series, "a", which were to be 
spread upon the earth, in order that the forms appear in their 
righteousness and truth.

"Verily" said he, "is righteousness in truth the key to this square. For the 
airs take the truth of the original impulse, and put it into the foursquare 
rightness of the earth, making it to be again as the son in the daughter."

"Look you beyond the pyramid, and see what the airs do make of this blue 
radiance of the mother."

Going out beyond the pyramid to the west, I saw in the air many angels, 
like unto the angel of the square, taking from the air that radiance of blue, 
leaving behind the yellow and violet of the square. The radiance wadded 
up like cotton candy, or clouds, in their hands. And they took them far 
about the surface of the earth, looking ever for the place where it should 
go.

I followed one of these angels to see what he did. As with the angels of 
the square of air within the lesser angle of fire, these angels looked for 
exactly that place of stress (in this case, lack of stress) where the wads of 
blue radiance would fit. But the criteria by which they selected each place 
was quite different from that of the previous angle of fire.

It seemed as if each angel listened to a note emanating from the wad in 
his hand. The earth itself resonated in time to these notes, but its 
resonance was stronger in some places than in others. But the angels 
centered their search almost immediately upon the proper location, and in 
an instant, plunged into the earth with their burden, following the resonant 
note until they came to exactly the right place.

Thereupon, they released the blue light, and it burst out, filling the earth 
around it, and blending with the earth so that they interpenetrated.

The angel at my side said that this was representative of the relationship 
between the ether and the manifest earth. One interpenetrated the other, 
and both sounded to the same note, so that there was little to distinguish 
between them as to their quality. (The angel also reminded me that the 
blue was also the color of air in the queen scale, as well as of water in the 
king scale. I had been thinking that the blue was the water of the previous 
square still, but it was actually the blue said to be characteristic of the 
etheric body of an object or being.)

This said, I asked the angel to continue. He did by saying: "Let us look 
then, to the ways in which this force works within the worlds.

"Within the mineral kingdom, does this force work as the function of 
transmitting electric and sound vibrations through the rock from place to 
place, in order that the charge upon the earth may be given unto its parts 
according to their nature. the sounds are transmitted through the rock in 
different ways, according to the condensation or density that it manifests. 
Certain parts of the earth are more likely to transmit particular frequencies 
than others, and so the scientists of your plane have sought to look into 
the earth by means of these waves of vibration.

"They have seen there many things, but the essence of the process 
escapes them yet. They use it without understanding of the nature or 
quality it reveals, thinking of it in different terms.

"Now in the plant kingdom, as we have seen, do the plants all have the 
power of communicating with the others of their kind, after a fashion. 
Since the main key to this is etheric, of the body of energetic air, so do 
they reflect this transmission on the physical plane by the emission of 
chemicals, or of odors as you would think of it, which are then picked up 
by the other plants, and are presumed by your men of science to be the 
only form of communication they have between them. Masking as it does 
the true form of the passage, via the more refined airs of ethyr.

In the animal kingdom as in the human, this square rules the manifest 
communications of the species, via the sounds and voices of speech. Yet 
the voices of the animals are not wholly of the air, for they express mainly 
the feeling-nature and not the thought-nature. In man, it is the kama-
manas, the thought-feeling nature, partly both, that is mainly expressed by 
voice.

But the process is yet under this square, for it is the airs of both types 
which cause the meaning, the feeling, to be transmitted.

"The odors which the bodies of man and animals emit also transmit 
information via the air, as do the plants mentioned earlier. These odors 
express the feeling nature both in man and in animal. It is only through the 
voice that man has been able to express his higher nature, intellect, which 
he so far shares only in small part with his animal brethren."

While this speech was being made, the scene before me had been slowly 
fading, so that it was now completely dark, with the voice the only part of 
the vision remaining. I called upon the angel and god again, and they told 
me to get up for a few minutes, and to have a hit of pot, while they did 
something.

I did this, all the while concentrating on the name of the angel, using it as 
a mantra but not looking for any vision. I took a couple of hits from my 
pipe, and leaned back and relaxed.

The angel reminded me that the preliminary to this vision, earlier this 
afternoon, had come to me without my sending for it. He said that this was 
natural, and that it is not cause for worry or alarm. Time is looser on this 
plane where they live, and the calling can often come after the answer, 
without any paradox being involved. The answer evokes its own calling, in 
a sense, and without the calling, the effect of the answer would have been 
rapidly lost.

He also reminded me that in that vision, the voice had said that the winds 
that blew about the earth stirred up notes in the minds and hearts and 
bodies of men, so that one was like a harp, another a bassoon, and 
another a trumpet. 

"This wind is also the Will of the Gods, translated and transmitted by the 
air. So that wherever it went upon the earth, that will stirred forth in man or 
woman those actions that were not only of use to the gods, but were also 
within the nature of the being being stirred."

"Now it is in this way that the will can have its way in the world, while men 
continue to have and express free will. Only those things which are of his 
essential nature, that he is already, will affect a man. Nothing that he does 
will in any way appear to be not of his own making. He will continue to 
express himself, yet at the same time he will express part of what the 
gods wish to have done. 

"So then is each stirred by the winds according to his way,  and each 
goes his way unnoticing of what his acts do within the larger scale. It is 
only when the man returns to the path to godhood, by which he came to 
be in the world at that time, that he notices that some actions seem to be 
out of character, or rather out of context. For in going back into the higher 
planes in the quest, he takes himself partially out of the frame of reference 
within which his fellow humans respond unnoticing to the will of the gods.

"Being out of the frame, he sees a little of what the gods intend, or rather 
of the larger patterns that are generated by the response to the gods' will. 
Thus he sees meaning where others see none, and every second of life 
appears fraught with significance. Some have made a fetish of this, 
saying the task of the master is to `interpret every event as a conversation 
between god and his soul'. 

"Yet this is only for small minds, who have naught to do but follow in the 
steps of those who came before, and to leave the creation to those 
greater gods whom they serve. Yet the magus, no, any magician, should 
he choose to be, can become a creator within the manifest world, with 
rights of creation equal of those of any god. To these latter, the pattern of 
the larger gods lessens in significance, and becomes again merely the 
environment within he works. He understands the correspondences 
between planes, and takes them so much for granted, that there is no 
need to attach any special significance to events, beyond those that are 
specifically directed at him by other creators.

"`The mountains become mountains again, and the trees, trees again.'"

"Also, these creators, taking on the aspect of the gods themselves, find 
that the world tends to bend itself to their purpose as individuals, without 
anything seeming to be out of the ordinary for any of those involved. It is 
his right, and the world accepts that right because it can not do otherwise.

"We have said before, and you have accepted, that you are a creator in 
truth. In your cabala, you have indeed turned the world on its head, and 
made it to fall at your feet. Yet withall, you have done something which is 
just as consistent, and even more useful in this new time, than the ancient 
cabala by which men have always achieved. It is this creation, which has 
taken you two lives to manifest fully, which brings you out among the 
gods, and makes you one of them in truth, for you have done that which 
few have dared to do, and have made it work. Success is its own proof, 
and nothing can deny this, not even the gods who come before.

"You thought in the beginning that this Tree was given to you by the gods, 
to be revealed to man. Yet this was not the case, save in the sense that it 
was your own godhood which brought it into matter. Those other 
magicians who have changed the tree have not yet made it of the 
symbolic consistency which you have done. Perhaps some of those, in 
their own time, will do as you have done, and take themselves from the 
subjection of the gods.

"You have planted your tree as a seed in the angle of fire of earth, and 
have reaped the harvests in the other angles. Now you have yet one more 
square to do here before going on to the last of these angles, and 
meeting the bride in her fullness.

"You ask why, if this Tree is your own creation, do the forces of the 
universe follow along, and not resist, going in the ways of the old.

"The universe accommodates itself to the magician, as we have said, and 
therefore your certain creation of the tree has made it of all truth. But think 
not that there is a war between the Trees, or that one must supersede the 
other, for there is still much of worth in that older tree, as you know, and 
many will achieve by its rules and expressions. But here in this tree, have 
you given what you wanted to give, an alternative that works, and 
removes many of the ills of the old ways.

"That Achad was not you goes without saying. You are in a sense his 
complement or contrast, though there are similarities of a sort between 
you. Two expressions of one life, which conceived the Tree in the spaces 
between lives, and has created those needed lesser aspects that will 
produce his effect. There is no difference between Achad's "guardian 
angel" so-called and yours. Your personalities as exempt adepts are 
merely the manifest side of this being, who in himself is greater than 
either. You have long known that the self above the abyss was not the 
self who is below, and that no man passes the abyss, but is only 
absorbed for a time by that higher being. That which is of the earth 
remains in the earth. That which is of the Ruach remains in the Ruach. 
That which transcends both remains transcendent. All is ever as it was. 
Yet the lower, by accommodating itself to the higher, has made itself to be 
the true reflection of that portion of the higher that is possible of 
manifestation. That this reflection will broaden in scope inevitable. Yet 
there will still be that "BNIAMIN ROVH", who unites all from Malkuth to 
Chesed within himself, expressing that same nature on all the planes."50

The forces seemed to be waning, so I returned to the pyramid for a few 
minutes, and invoked the names of the angle again.

The angel returned with me, and when I felt I had the force in hand again, 
we went up through the top of the pyramid, rising above the earth into a 
world of brilliant white clouds and blue sky.

Each cloud seemed to be the home of some thinker, some person who 
had the force of mind to create or recreate something within the world that 
his fellows had not had before. I could see castles of many types seated 
in the clouds like the classic Jack-and-Beanstalk castle.

"These are those whose life has been given to great thoughts, whose 
thinking has moved the world in some way. Many would not be known at 
all today, yet in their own subtle ways, their effect has been many times 
that of other thinkers.

"Now that they have died of the body, and gone to their rest, as the 
Christians would have it, they are given to coming here, into this world, 
and thinking. For the airs of this place are conducive to those thoughts 
which are of the true nature of human expression, and therefore do those 
who think for humanity, who are its brain, come here to refine their skills 
and to put together new thoughts from the will of the gods.

"Now, if we were to go into one of these houses, as you have done in the 
past in another life, then we would see there the man living much as he 
chose to live when he was upon the earth. For the comforts of the earth, 
which here are in abundance, give the anchor that allows the mind to go 
to the farthest reaches in search of its goals. As well the anchor prevents 
both the man from becoming lost, and the thoughts from going too far 
astray from what will work within the world. If this were not the case, then 
these men would be madmen, and their ideas of no use to humanity.

"Let us rise up again through the planes, and see what else we might see 
within the airs of earth."

We did so, rising for some minutes, while physically, I leaned back and 
relaxed again.

Presently we came to a halt in another area of sky, but there were no 
clouds here this time, simply blue sky. The angel remarked in passing that 
even my smoking of marijuana tonight was within the parameters of the 
square, for it was like until an incense of an earthy nature, and therefore 
was air of earth again. I got some amusement out of this, and the angel 
laughed out loud, seemingly in good fellowship. His dark face showed an 
expression of innocent fun.

As we stood in the air, it became night, and the sky was revealed with its 
stars shining brightly, each in its natural place and course. But for some 
reason, I appreciated the night-blue darkness between the stars as much 
as the stars themselves. The dark parts of the sky seemed to become 
multidimensional in the same way that they did in the last vision of the 
fiery lesser angle.

And a voice said: "The child has come upon the mother again, this time as 
the backdrop for these wonderful stars, which are truly my children. Note 
how each of them glows against my body with a jewel-like luster, each of 
its own lovely tint, each a faceted thing of wonder, just the thing for my 
new child to appreciate."

I looked at the stars, and they did indeed seem like jewels, like the crystal 
stars of my vision of the Beast and the Star.

"Go ye now, my child, and see what there is to be seen among these 
stars. Think not to call upon the angel again, for he has fallen far behind 
you in your race up the ladders of the air, and here at the edge of the 
earth, the air is of too light a form for him to be supported. Thus ye be on 
your own, save that I am with you, and will see you come to no harm. 
Give the sign of the Enterer towards these, my other children."

All this time my astral body had been slowly expanding, so that now it was 
large enough to enclose both the earth and the moon within itself. Looking 
out from the system, I made the sign of the Enterer, and immediately I left 
the earth and moon behind, heading off in the direction of the center of 
the galaxy.51

As I progressed, it seemed as if I was entering into a space that was very 
regular. I could feel the dimensions of it, and they all were at right angles 
to each other, not at all distorted by gravity.

The stars came up and engulfed me, and as they did, they seemed to 
expand until every bit of the space was filled with the light of the stars. As 
in the previous vision of this image, the stars were all of crystal, each flare 
and flash of light showing sharp edges. It reminded me of the edge-effects 
sometimes seen under small doses of LSD. I recalled seeing a lawn while 
doing acid that had the same crystal-bright sharpness that these stars 
had.

Nuit bent down and said: "Yes, my son, who has traveled the stars to this 
little world, in order to help in the work of her initiation. This world is 
indeed the same vision in which we met once before. But that time, you 
had wrenched the vision out of the air by your will alone, thus proving your 
right to its fullness. Now and here, I give it to you freely, as is your right.

I had the sensation of both shrinking and expanding at once. Some of my 
consciousness seemed to go back into my body, while another part was 
expanded to the limits of creation.

Nuit said: "I am separating you from the clothes that you wear, in order 
that you be seen for what you are by those in this place."52 

I had the distinct sensation that that part of myself that was not on the 
earth was being held by Nuit as a mother holds a child in her arm, while 
showing it to others. I felt enveloped in her, but at the same time, exposed 
to view.

I also felt something of the awe of that other self. His feeling was much 
like that childhood memory of mine, when I first realized that I was a 
separate being, and that all these big creatures looking at me (my 
mother's friends) were also of my kind, each separate and individual. Yet 
the feeling I receive from that other part of myself now is like that 
remembered feeling but purified and refined, and multiplied an 
hundredfold.

This was a literal shock. I could sense my other part feeling like it was 
being torn apart from the force of the realization. But then I saw that 
where there had been tearing, I was now showing the star-like qualities of 
the other beings there. 

There was also a sense that these other stars were all looking with 
intense interest as my star-body was unveiled, as if they wanted to see 
the quality of the star from its first instants. The pressure of their interest 
was palpable.

Then each in turn looked at me closely, and for the most part I sensed 
qualified approval, as if it were too soon to tell for certain. I also sensed 
that there was some reason for wanting to see if I could stand there on my 
own yet.

The other part of myself looked at the stars, and saw that they kept their 
relative places through a sort of internal gyroscopic motion. I tried to 
imitate it with my own body, and as I did so, my own spines of light 
blurred, until I appeared as a rapidly spinning sphere. 

I wondered how I could keep spinning while still showing my rays and 
spines as the others did. But then, as the rate of spin increased the crystal 
rays and spines began to reappear. The ones in the cardinal directions 
appeared first, followed by two above and below. Then more appeared at 
the forty-five degree intervals between each pair, and so on, until the 
whole body was again radiating at full blast.

There was a sense that my star-self was drawing energy from my own 
interactions with the earth's etheric field, so that I was acting as a 
transformer, bringing it up to his level. A sensation like a small flow of 
electrical current went through my body and aura. I offered full control of 
the etheric body to that other, but he declined to take it, indicating that it 
was my part of things to be where I was.

I could sense an expansion of the limits of my aura, as if the star-self was 
reaching through me to the world, and using it as an anchor and "electric 
plug" all in one. The more energy he needed, the larger it grew. Nuit told 
me that this was like unto what I had seen in the earlier square, where the 
mysteries of incarnation had been revealed. Save that here I was seeing it 
from the inside.

After several minutes during which the star-self maintained its stability, the 
others stars seemed to give unqualified approval. They then turned their 
attention away, going about their business.

Nuit indicated that the star-self could relax, and not worry about 
maintaining itself. It did so, and some of its consciousness added itself to 
mine on the astral level, so that my own level was raised up a bit.

However, we did not merge into each other again. While he now occupied 
the same space as myself, he still seemed to be a separate entity from 
me.

The vision did not seem to want to continue, but the forces did not go 
away, so I went and lay down for a few minutes and relaxed fully.

There was a great deal of interaction between myself the scribe and the 
star-self while I lay down. Most of it was of too fleeting a nature to write 
down. Too many things came through at the same time to sort out.

I saw the star-self being laid with others of its kind in a sort of nursery. 
Here, each was suspended on the top of a plane (which I took to be the 
top of the Ruach where it meets the abyss). Each star sent down into the 
Ruach a single ray of light, which anchored itself in Tiphereth. Each 
anchor was a reflection of the star in the less refined matter of the Ruach.

From somewhere, I was told that the rays sent down were a part of the 
consciousness of the stars, and that they needed to have a conscious 
connection with that lower world in order to get the energy they needed 
out of it. This energy traveled up the path of Shin from Tiphereth into this 
higher level.

The difference between a newborn star, I was told, was that the new child 
had to continue to keep a portion of its awareness in the lower world to 
get its energy, where the adult form did not need to, but drew its energy 
without any conscious attention. The later type no longer had to incarnate 
as a man, and could go on to make its incarnation out of larger bodies, 
such as planets and suns. 

The force was not weakening, but I felt that I was getting too fatigued to 
see clearly. I decided to end things at this point, and banished the forces.


12/22/85 7:35 pm

Square "O" of the Airy Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.

As the vision opened, I was in darkness, riding high above a very dark 
plane. The only light was a soft glow on the horizon to the south, that 
extended almost to overhead. A chill wind blew, cutting into my bones.

A voice said: "This is the chill wind that blows directly above the earth, the 
ether where it is most of its earthlike quality. No light is left, for it has all 
been sucked up into the daughter's womb, to issue forth again in another 
time."

I saw the earth recede before me, until I was hanging in empty space, 
with darkness all around. I called upon the name of the angel again. The 
pyramid formed around me. But it seemed smaller than before, so that I 
had to lower my head to fit beneath the cieling. I felt very cramped and 
restricted.

I burst out the pyramid, and saw the angel, waiting in the air. He was all 
black, except for his feet, which were yellow, and had small wings. I gave 
him the 5=6 signs, and He responded with Rending of the Veil, the signs 
of Set and Shu, and the Closing of the Veil.

He said: "I know that you feel dark and cramped here, o mighty one. Yet 
this is the nature of the square, that the airs are all shut up, and made to 
conform to the pattern of the earth, so that it has taken on the cold and 
inertia of the earth. I show you my sphinx."

The sphinx appeared, showing itself as all bull except for the rear legs, 
which were human, and the lack of a tail. It parts were in the appropriate 
colors.

I tested them both with the letters, and they appeared unaffected.

I acknowledge that they were as they appeared. The angel suggested that 
I call upon the goddess of the square, Nepthys. I did so, and she 
appeared. He skin was utter white, with black brows and hair. All her 
raiment was black and white. We exchanged the signs, and she said:

"We meet again, o wonderer, as we have at the end of each of these 
angles, for I am the goddess of the earth tablet, and in each of these final 
squares do I receive my homage from the sub-angles. 

The vision became darker until I could see nothing. But the sense of the 
goddess was still there. I waited.

Things remained as they were for several minutes, and then I asked 
Nepthys to teach me about the square.

She said "The things to be taught here might be better taught to you in 
another way. Go you to your room and do a tarot reading. Then return.

I did a reading, which did not say much except that the force of earth were 
glad that I was there attempting to learn of them, and that they would be 
glad to teach me. I returned to the vision.

The force remained and seemed to increase a little, but still nothing 
happened. So I decided to quit and go do something else until I got an 
indication of what to do next.

12/23/85

I did not return to the vision that night. 

The next day, I considered doing the invocation again, but a feeling told 
me not to. Instead, I felt I should try another shot at describing my own 
special magickal technique, even though I had pretty much abandoned 
the effort after several failures to come up with a simple and satisfactory 
description. Each of my previous efforts had become lost in either a 
confusing terminology or a surfeit of philosophizing, and each failure was 
worse than the last.

But I tried anyway, and in a couple of hours came up with complete, 
concise descriptions of the basic technique, and of three ways it could be 
used to separate the consciousness from the Ruach. I titled the paper 
"The Archer" since the exercise is an expression of the nature of 
Sagittarius.

It was only after I printed out a proof copy and read it over that I realized 
that the paper had 22 points in 10 pages and 4 sections. The last section, 
which was identical with point 22, could be further subdivided into four 
sections. Each of the 22 points could be related in some way to the 
Hebrew letters. Thus the whole tree of life was represented, and Malkuth, 
represented by point 22 (= Tau = Saturn = Earth) and section 4 (= Heh 
final = Earth), was divided into the sub-elements, which I happen to be 
exploring just now.

Since communication is a function of Air, and this paper was a 
manifestation (Earth) of communication, it seemed likely that this was 
what Nepthys had meant when she said the lesson of the square could be 
taught in other than the usual way. The complex internal structure of the 
paper seemed to support this as well.

I still intend to invoke this square once more, but likely not until tomorrow.

12/27/85

Reading this over in light of the experiences of the next few days, I feel 
that the vision of 12/21/85, which was invoked under Air of Air of Earth, 
actually combined that permutation of IHVH with Earth of Air of Earth. The 
dividing line between the two squares would be the vision of the thinker's 
homes in the clouds. Everything after that image relates more to the latter 
permutation than to the former. So the angel did indeed complete the tour 
of the subangle before the three-day blockage I experienced at the winter 
solstice.

There is also an interesting connection with the vision of being presented 
to the queen of night, to be described under Water of Earth of Earth. The 
parallel with the presentation of the new star to the older stars seems 
obvious after the fact.

However, this does not invalidate the production of the manuscript 
mentioned above as a manifestation of the square Earth of Air of Earth.


Square "c" of the Earthy Lesser Angle
of the Earth Tablet

12/24/85 4:30 pm

I invoked the square "c" of the Earthy Lesser Angle of Earth. This square 
is yod of heh final of heh final.

The pyramid formed around me, with the north and south sides in black 
with the sigil of earth thereon, and the east and west sides red with the 
red and green sigil of fire on them.

I entered into the pyramid through the south side, and called upon the 
angel of the square, cncr, and the goddess, Apis.53 The angel appeared 
with black skin and dressed in a red robe. Apis appeared, showing the 
cows head with what I call the horned sun crown, with the sun in red, and 
her collar and sashes were red on white.

I gave the 5=6 signs, and she answered with LVX. Then the angel next to 
her disappeared, and in his place was a large man wearing a crown. Apis 
said that this was because this square of the tablet was fire of earth of 
earth, where the bride meets her new master.

"Come, and touch the ball of my crown." she said. I did so, and as my 
hand came away, it took on a glow of red light. I looked at the palm, and 
saw burnt skin falling away to reveal a pentagram burned into the skin, 
with the sigils of the elements scribed at the appropriate angles. The 
pentagram was oriented so that it was upright when the hand was held 
with the thumb pointing up. 

I asked Apis what it meant. She replied, "This is the mark of the great 
creators upon the earth, the masters of the square of earth. For the earth 
in itself does contain all of the other elements in their due proportions, and 
therefore is the master of the earth also the master of these others, 
should he put his mind to it as being needful. Come with me and we shall 
see what we shall see."

She took me instantly to a great hall, wherein many man of ancient visage 
and strong eyes sat at a table and drank lightly.

"These are the masters of earth at their business, which is to monitor the 
rate of growth upon the earth of the things of the spirit, and to attempt to 
encourage that growth where it is needed. They have had their eye on 
you since the beginning of your most recent retreat into matter. For the 
health of the spirit requires those who are able to see of the spirit, and to 
take what actions are needed to correct the problem. 

"You yourself combine the qualities of fire and earth in your dealings with 
the world, for is not your sun and midheaven of the nature of fire, and 
your mercury directly upon the winter solstice point, in the earth's house? 
Therefore are you of their kind from the first, and more will be given to you 
as you see how your work will unfold in their schemes.

"This is the end of our tale about this. Let us go on."

"I wish to give you this ring of your status within the masters of earth. Give 
me your left hand, with the fingers spread."

I extended my hand palm down, and she reached for it with her left hand. 
Her right hand held a ring, seemingly of black stone, within which was a 
red stone engraved with a sigil of earth above a sigil of fire. Into the ring 
poured a flow of force from the crown of Apis, coming from both of the 
horns, and from the center of the ball of the sun in the middle. The ring 
glowed a bit brighter, but the main effect was to clarify the images of the 
sigils, making them stand out on the smooth surface.

I asked what the significance of the ring was. She told me that the basic 
masters had a ring of one stone, with the two tablets engraved thereon. 
The Lesser Masters (really the middle of the three) had a double stone, 
with one sigil engraved upon each stone, and the stone of the appropriate 
type for the element. The highest masters, or Governing Masters, had a 
special sigil on a medallion that they hung about their necks. I was now a 
basic master, and with the training I would receive I would quickly become 
a lesser master. The governing masters governed unto the stewardship of 
the spirit of the earth, with whom I had already had congress, and 
appointment to their ranks came from her at her will.

Then the angel appeared, and said, "The meeting of the Governing 
Masters is almost over, and there is to be an announcement." We turned, 
and over the heads of the other masters who appeared in the hall, I 
watched as three men came into the room from the far end.54

The first of the men had a face exactly like one of DaVinci's paintings. A 
face that was sharp and weathered beneath flowing white hair and a white 
beard. He wore a gray cloth robe, that shimmered a little in the light, as if 
it was made of silk.

The second had on a black robe, and appeared much younger than the 
other two. He had a businesslike arrangement of straps and holders of 
various sorts hung about his person. On the breast of his robe was a six-
pointed star in blue. 

The third man hung back in the shadows, but I could see that he also 
wore a gray robe, and he carried a large book under his arm.

The second man said: "First, I would like to welcome back our new 
brother, who has just come up in the world a bit. Brother Benjamin?

I said in the vision "Thank you. I am pleased to be here, and I look 
forward to working with all of you. But we will have to do something about 
my earthside self. He is getting suspicious and will not go along with us 
without some proof of our reality."

He said "We'll take care of that. Anything else you would like to say?"

"Only that I look forward to finding out what the heck this is all about."

He said in a voice that seemed a little cold: "You'll learn."

"Now, for our other announcement, the Mother has decided to add 
another man to her personal staff, and it seems that our new member has 
been the one chosen, Goddess alone only knows why. We will have to 
see that he changes his smartmouth ways before we get too much farther 
along."

He looked at me again appraisingly. "Ask a stupid question.", I thought.

"We will have to cram into him a lot more stuff than he can absorb directly 
in these little invocations of his, so our work is cut out for us. See that he 
gets every detail that he will need within the next two weeks. Then we will 
see if he is fit enough to pass the goddess's muster. That is all."

I smiled sheepishly, and waited for the men to leave. The first man gave 
me a wink as he passed out of the room. The other masters left came 
around, and touched hands with me.

One of them, wearing a dark black robe with the cowl thrown back, came 
up and shook my hand, and said, "Good to have you here. My name is 
Grenelpik.55 Don't worry about old fussbudget up there. He's like that with 
all the new men. Is that your name, Benjamin? Is that a fiery name of 
some sort?"

"It's in another symbol system." I said.

"Oh, that's all right then. We all use these odd systems some of the time. 
Which one is yours?"

"Achad's Tree of Life.", I said.

"hmmm. And what did you do to it to make it up here with the other bright 
boys?

"Just reworked it."

The conversation continued for a few moments on inconsequentials, and 
then he suggested that we "repair to the refectory" for something to drink. 
I didn't know how I could drink in this body, but I told him to lead on.

He took me down a long corridor, also colored in the same gray as the 
two Governing Masters. It seemed like one of the outside halls at 
Versailles, with high windows along the southern wall. I tried to look out 
the windows as we passed, but could not see anything clearly.

We continued down the hall to a large double door, which was opened at 
our approach. We entered what looked like a comfortable cafeteria-style 
executive dining hall.

We took drinks from a perfectly ordinary looking butler, and walk across 
the room to the windows, where we sat down.

Grenelpik said: "This business of protocol on the goddess's staff isn't as 
urgent as the master makes it sound. She allow you a few mistakes now 
and then. But woe betide you if you contradict her in public, or when any 
lower staff members are present. Then you'll be out on your ear in a 
minute. She doesn't like the flow of her thoughts to be interrupted. So 
speak when spoken to would be your best bet when she is in the room."

"Now this other thing about public appearances is that the queen's 
wizards must always follow immediately behind her in her train, so you'll 
be close up most of the time and can see what's going on. But just 
between you and me its a bloody bore most of the time. Its only when 
some sharp foreigner comes to the court that we see some action."

"Now you must have some questions."

I nodded, and said, "Yes. First of all, why did she pick me for her staff? I'm 
not the most prepossessing figure this country has produced by a long 
shot, and being new at court I couldn't help her with the politics at all. I'm 
not sure how I can be of service to her."

He said, "I'm not certain, but aren't you a philosopher of sorts? And one 
who's know not to like Roman Christians? that could have something to 
do with it. She likes to have men around her who can think as well as men 
who can act. And Rome isn't exactly on her list of favorite places right 
now, what with all the wars they're fomenting."

I said, "But how can I be a member of her staff when I have to spend most 
of my time in that other worlds where the body is? I'm no good at being in 
two places at once, even with he best of motivations."

"We'll handle that. I know this all seems unreal to you right now, since 
your only half in our world. But we can help you where you are there, too. 
There's lots of ways that you can be supported without looking too out of 
place in the scheme of things."

I said this was beginning to look a lot like some sort of occult conspiracy 
to revive the British Empire. Or like something by the Bavarian Illuminati.

"It does look that way, doesn't it? But you'll learn more fast, and we'll see 
that you aren't too discommoded in that other world of yours. How can 
you stand it down there?"

"Somebody has to do the work."

The vision faded and I returned to the pyramid. Apis was there waiting for 
me. 

She said: "I hope you are not too confused by all that has gone on here. 
The vision that you have just seen was from your last nightly visit to the 
palace of the queen of the night, who is the daughter of our mother the 
goddess. The goddess resides there when she is on these levels of the 
tablet, and we have to see that she has all that she wants while she is 
there. That is why we have been discouraging your invocations the last 
few days."

"But now that she has made her selection and gone, we have enough 
time to fill you in on what you must do here."

"First, as part of her staff, you are there only to answer questions when 
she seeks your help. If this is all you do, though, you will likely end up out 
int he cold again. But she likes people to go against her in sensible ways, 
and if you come out on top, you will have an even stronger position from 
which to work for your world.

"You have to get into her good graces by competence, not flattery. She 
doesn't mind a bit of flattery, but tires of repetition. Give her mind 
something to work on, though, and she will thank you. Give me your hand 
again."

She took my left hand, which already had a ring on it, and pressed her 
horn against it, then her mouth, then her eye. She took her head away, 
and a cross was burned in black into the hand.

"This is the other sign of your power, the sign of the tablet of earth, which 
is the cross in the circle. Now that you have seen with your eyes what you 
self has known for days, let us finish this vision's section and go on to 
other things. Take a break for a moment."

I did so.

"Now, on the other side of this world, in the heart of the earth, lies the 
palace of the queen of night. She is the first of those who live beyond the 
bounds of the earth, within the inter-spherical spaces between the 
universes. She encloses the earth in her power, and therefore is the most 
potent in her effect upon it. "

"Your trip to her palace is in the likeness of a trial period, as you would 
have it, during which you are allowed only so many mistakes. If you pass 
this period with flying colors, then you are guaranteed a position from 
which you can do your work as you will. If you pass adequately, you will 
be offered a place within the ranks of the Lesser Masters, after a period of 
further training. If you wash out, we likely will not see you again here."

I asked how I was to know what to do. 

"In your after-dream time, when your mind would normally be in the 
deepest of sleeps, your spirit goes to this world. It is only in recent days 
that we have found the ways to get you here in your other consciousness, 
thanks to your invocations of the tablet of earth. You have balanced 
yourself well for this work, and with you available at least part of the time 
in your (normal/journeying/mundane?) consciousness, you can be of 
service to both yourself and her without difficulty.

"Now we will see what else there is to see of this place. Let me take you 
to another part of the palace, and you can see our eidoranium."

We travelled instantly to a room that had been darkened, but which held a 
large sphere that glowed with a soft light. Inside the sphere I saw what 
appeared to be a complete model of the local universe, with the stars all 
in their proper relations, and the earth at the center. It was working in real-
time, so no motions were visible, but it seemed as if adjustments were 
made so that everything always focused on earth as the center.

"Naturally," said Apis, "for what else are we here for but to monitor the 
currents around the earth, and to determine what effects might be made 
of them. For there is much yet unseen by the eyes of man's science that 
we detect and use to influence him. Some of the things that are shown 
here will never be seen of man in his normal habitation."

"But we can use them to good effect within both the human kingdom and 
the other kingdoms. Being closest to the earth, yet having the power of 
the mother behind us, we have the responsibility to see that all the 
influences sent down by the other tablets, as well as those outside the 
tablets, are in accord with the needs and wishes of the earth. We have no 
wish to start a war that could destroy the earth, for example, and therefore 
do we attempt to mitigate the effects of such forces as demand war."

"On the other hand, anything which can improve the lot of life on earth is 
welcomed, even though it be harsh to some within the earth's sphere. 
Thus many animals have died at man's hand, yet the life continues. When 
he has come out of his technological Morass again, and wishes to make 
of the earth a garden again, then will we be pushing him to cease his 
despoliation. This is not so far away as one might think, from the 
mundane view.

"Now, as to your own role in this, you are to be an advisor to her on what 
ever subject she deems to have you study. Let your mind roam in the next 
few days, and you might catch glimpses of more of this. But the main 
instruction shall be during those periods when you have abandoned your 
body altogether in after-dream time, and are free to learn without 
resistance. Do not worry your earthly self about how to get here, or 
whether to make an effort to do so. His participation can grow slowly, as 
we show him how we intend to work, and show him our power."

"Go you now to the ends of the earth, and give thanks that you have been 
selected for our lady's service, for many are called, but few are chosen, 
and you are one of the few.

"Let us end this vision now, and you can come another day to get some 
more in the rest of these squares. You will also find many things of an 
earthy nature cropping up in your life. Be warned not to take these too 
seriously as a sign, for they are mere side-effects, and the major effect is 
yet to come."

I closed the temple and returned to my body.

Square "n" of the Earthy Lesser Angle 
of the Earth Tablet

12/25/86 6:04 pm

I invoked the forces of the tablet of Earth, and of the square "n" of the 
Earthy Lesser Angle.

The vision opened just long enough for someone to tell me to go to my 
office and start up my word processor. I did this, and then waited.

I formulated the pyramid around me, with black north and south walls, and 
blue east and west walls. The appropriate sigils were put thereon.

The pyramid seemed to fill with a great light with just a touch of blue in it. I 
stepped back to one corner of the pyramid, and saw that the light was 
focused upon the center of the room, coming in in a tight beam through 
the small square the was the top of the pyramid.

I stepped back into the beam, and followed it upwards. As I watched the 
pyramid dwindle away below me, I saw that I was rising through a region 
of fluffy blue clouds, with not a trace of gray or white in them. And the sky 
was blue beyond them. I worried a bit, because this seemed more airy 
than was correct for the attributes of this square.

I called upon the names again. The image went out of focus, then 
returned to focus showing the earth tablet floating with me in the blue air. 
The kerubic squares of the earthy lesser angle were highlighted, and as I 
pronounced the letters of the angel's name for the square, the equivalent 
square in the tablet was highlighted.

An Angel with black skin and blue-white robes appeared in the air about 
20 yards to my right. I turned to face him and did the 5=6 signs. He 
returned them with the signs of set and auramoth sandwiched between 
them. I tested him with the pentagrams and the letters, and he was not 
affected by them.

I asked the angel what we were doing in this airy seeming place, since the 
attributes of the square are water and earth. 

He said, "This is the water beyond the earth, which is in someways also 
an air. But it is not the same type of air as the air of the ether. No, it is 
rather as if a liquid had expanded itself to a gaseous density.

"The reason we have brought you here is to explain something about your 
experience of the square of earth of air of earth, which it is necessary for 
you to know before continuing with these visions. 

"That is, that the reason you were not answered directly in that square 
was that the queen of night was holding a fete for her mother the 
goddess, and we must needs be on hand to assist in this work. For is not 
the winter solstice the height of Her power? Yet does the Sun move 
therein with a heightening power over the dark, therefore did you see light 
instead of darkness in those squares of yesterday.

"You got the part of the invocation of the mother that you were intended to 
get, and you responded by working anyway. This is rather remarkable, 
since the average magician would have waited in those circumstances for 
a better day. You must have an intent to go through with these things no 
matter what, and you showed that this was true in your case. You showed 
the right instinct, and used the forces available to you to the best of your 
ability.

"Therefore did you produce that paper that you have slaved over at times, 
without really getting to the essence of your intent. By taking the forces of 
the day [that is, of Earth of Air of Earth] and applying them to your 
problem, you came up with a short rendition with all of the necessary 
ingredients for the magicians, and none left over for the amateurs to pick 
at. And by that way did you show your mastery of the square even in the 
dark of the light.

Now, to continue with the explanation, The queen of the night was testing 
you to see if you were suitable for her own set of workers, since you have 
much of the power of the earth in you in various ways. But you have 
shown yourself to be worthy of a greater service,and therefore were you 
initiated yesterday into the powers of the Masters of the Earth. This was 
our intent and thus did we do, except that we did not bring you to the bride 
for your marriage. This was left for the next phase. 

"Now you should think back to yesterday's ceremony and... " 

The vision suddenly cut off at this point. 

I reviewed the record of the previous days vision. I saw that I had not 
made note of the fact that at one point in the vision, I had seemed to 
myself to be someone other than my normal self, but rather my 
complement within this universe. This person seemed to be Dr. John Dee. 
In fact, at one point, which came after I closed the temple, I was having a 
conversation with someone on the queen of night's staff, and was told, 
"We're lucky to have you with us, Dr. Dee."

I also did not make note of the fact that the image was much clearer and 
more immediate than my astral visions usually are. There was a depth to 
them that I do not usually see. Also, more of my consciousness was in the 
vision than is usually the case, or the connection between the astral body 
and the brain was more open than usual. At any rate, I found myself 
falling back into the vision several times without intending to. 

I finally did some more banishings, and everything seemed to settle down. 
But for the rest of the day I felt as if something in me had been touched 
that I had closed off for years as impossible to accomplish. Yet here I was 
being offered exactly what I have worked for, and my soul was quite ready 
to accept it as true.

But what was being offered was so much like a wish-fulfillment and was 
such a comfortable idea that I felt I had to resist it until I had some proof of 
what I was getting into. The course of the visions had been reasonably 
consistent up to this point, despite the changes in the mode of 
presentation, but the combination of such an offer, with the intense power 
of the vision made it vital that it be established as valid by a means that 
did not travel through me. Without such a proof, the possibility of self-
delusion was too strong to ignore.

So I told the gods, in effect, "Put up or shut up. You've told me many 
times that I'm your boy without ever giving a shred of positive evidence. 
Now I'm not going to believe anything else until you do. Show me your 
power!" 

Perhaps this is hubris, thinking I am enough like the gods to demand such 
a thing, but Liber AL does say "...certainty, not faith, while in life." I felt that 
such a claim required some manifest sign that would establish its validity.

I don't know what the final result of this will be. At least I haven't been 
struck by lightning as yet. So here it is, 7:30 pm, and I'm waiting.

A voice said, "At the ends of the earth do the fires stand, and the waters 
of the mother come up to greet them in their glory. Such is the way of the 
waters with the fires, that their heat and light are translated into motion 
and matter."

I saw the image of a large ocean's shore with clouds rising up out of the 
east bringing rain storms. To the west, winds gathered up the water again.

The voice said, "The waters of the east are stirred up from the fury of the 
father entering into the mother, and therefore do the waters boil off into 
clouds of steam. The waters of the west are giving unto their sons that 
which they need to live."

"Therefore do the fire and the waters produce the sun in his glory, and the 
daughter in her chastity, which the son does then break, lifting her up to 
the mother's place."

"We have seen this before in all the squares, under different guises. Now 
we say it openly: You are the sun become the father, and therefore do 
you rule all of the squares of the tablet of earth, which you have raised to 
your seat with your love.

"Think not, o man, that this be delusion; for yet do we have that to show 
you which will stretch the bounds of your imagination, as the circus callers 
used to say.

"Why do I speak of circus callers here? You say that we can not jump 
from the serious to the humorous? But what if we were serious? Could we 
not say that the Circus caller stirs up the crowd, which is the waters of 
mob feelings, inducing them to see the show, which is the air, and gaining 
money, earth for the caller, who is himself then the fire? So could we go 
on all night, for the limits of IHVH have never been reached. Thus he 
holds his position before those later gods of men.

"But on the whole is IHVH a righteous god, and willing to give to his 
children what they wish, so long as he has their adoration. The gods 
appreciate the attentions of men, since none of their own level will 
worship them. "

I appreciated the irony of this comment and said so. But the angel just 
stood there and smiled. It seemed that while we had been talking, a room 
formed around us, with gray walls, and a large skylight, through which 
light shone brightly, to be mellowed and reflected by the wall. A cool 
breeze blew through the room from behind me, and out the window. The 
angel stood just to the left of the patch of light from the skylight.

It seemed to me that we had for some reason, come back to the last 
square of the Airy Lesser Angle, to see something I missed due to the 
previous interference. I was surprised that this had happened, since I was 
in another Lesser Angle now. I asked the angel why this was, but he just 
said that "We like to do things in order here.", and went back to leaning on 
the wall. 

I got up and got a glass of water, and returned to the vision. I was still 
looking at the wall, but the angel had gone. Since I didn't know which 
names would be effective, since I seemed to be in the wrong square, I 
decided to wait for a few minutes and see if anything else would happen.

The image slowly turned around until I was looking into a dark loft. As I 
waited, more light went into it, and I could see that it was full of cases, 
boxes, and assorted other junk, none of it recognizable as having any 
useful purpose.

I moved among the boxes and opened one. Within there was a set of 
comedy and tragedy masks, like those usually put on the covers of 
English Lit. books. In another was a black-and-white checked harlequin 
costume, with a black ruff around the neck, and a small domino mask. 

I was told to put on the harlequin disguise, so that we could go to the 
party without arousing too much attention. I felt kind of foolish doing so, so 
I checked the angel with the pentagrams again. He seemed to expand 
with the earth pentagram, and the air pentagram, and to shrink when I 
tried that water pentagram. Since I knew his identity now to be earth and 
air, I knew which of the pyramids I was in.

I donned the costume, and affixed the mask to my face. The angel did not 
bother, saying it would be assumed by all present that his current dress 
was his costume.

I asked if there was anything else. He said, "Affix the badge of the master 
to your chest."

I asked what badge. "Touch the palms of your hands to your chest above 
the pocket, and leave an image of the signs on your palms there."

I did so, leaving an image of the cross above the pentagram.

The angel said, "At these public functions, it is always better to wear your 
badge of rank openly, so that those who wish to know do not need to 
ask."

I said that I understood, and asked what sort of a public function it was.

He said, "The queen of night is holding a ball in honour of her mother the 
goddess, who has just left the palace. She is glad to be back on her own 
again, and will have some more time to talk to you if you wish."

I said I would be glad to talk to her if it was not too much trouble, but I was 
not certain if I had anything to talk about, and did not wish to put her to the 
effort of making leading remarks to draw me out.

At this, the angel left. He returned shortly with the news that the queen 
would see me in a few minutes, and that we should make ourselves at 
home.

The angel suggested we go into the drawing room where the lesser 
ranking guests were being served, and get some drinks. I followed him 
into a room across from the entrance I had been looking at, and to one 
side of the main entrance to the hall.

I saw that there were several harlequins in the hall, so I would not stand 
out in the crowd. The angel said that all the magicians had agreed to 
dress as harlequins this year, in honor of the man of earth. 

Did he mean me? I asked.

"No," he replied, "just in honor of the men who took the spirit into the 
earth, and played the fool with it for the eyes of man to gaze upon. You 
are one such, but then, so are they all."

"Now, take your drink and let us circulate. The hall will not be filled for the 
receiving line for another hour yet, and the queen will not summon you to 
speak before then."

I took a glass of what looked like good dark ale, with a head on it, and 
took a sip. It left a taste of peat in the nostrils, but was good going down. I 
looked to the angel, and he led off into the crowd, avoiding anyone who 
did not have the suit of the harlequin on.

"Since we are a trade guild here, we have to take our refreshment in the 
tradesmen's hall. But we recognize that the other tradesmen think we are 
crazy sons of bitches, and leave them alone. Here is one of your 
compatriots looking for someone to talk to."

I looked at the man, and saw that he was more rotund than most, and had 
the look of an old bull dog to his face behind the mask.

I said, "Good evening sir. I see that you are of my guild, and alone. May I 
join you?"

The man looked at me, and then nodded. "I am the master thrace, of the 
lesser brethren, and I would be pleased to have your company. Would 
you walk with me to a less crowded corner of the room?"

I said that I would be pleased to do so. As we walked across the room to 
take a seat by the planters, I said, "This is my first visit to court, I'm afraid. 
I am still uncertain as to the protocol to be followed by an ordinary 
brother."

He said, "There is nothing to it. Unless the queen speaks to you directly, 
simply bow when you come before her, wait a few seconds, then rise and 
turn and leave. If you should have the misfortune to be the one to be 
picked out tonight to select the motto of the new year, then she will ask 
you all sorts of uncomfortable questions. Answer them as you will, but try 
to be not too much of a disgrace to the guild."

"There is not much else you need to know. When you back out, go to the 
end of the receiving line on the left, and follow through with the other court 
dignitaries. If you introduce yourself, you title is master, or ordinary 
master, as you choose. The first sounds more intimidating, the latter more 
realistic. Take your pick."

"Master Benjamin Rowe", I tried. "Ordinary Master Benjamin Rowe. You 
are right, the second does sound more working-class and harmless. The 
first one sounds like the addresses on the letters my grandmother used to 
send me. Maybe I should use that one tonight, since I always thought of 
her as an old queen."

"Our queen is not so old," he said, "As you may find out to your regret 
tonight. There's still a lot of fight in her, and always will be, stubborn as 
she is. And she certainly keeps herself in the bloom of youth in other 
ways, does she not?"

I said I did not thing I had seen her to know.

"Just so.", he nodded. "Not to spread gossip about the queen is a good 
way to keep your head on your shoulders, but I really would like your 
opinion after you meet her. "

I said that if it seemed appropriate, and anything was said that affected 
the guild's welfare, then of course the guild should know. But otherwise I 
would stick to generalities.

"Good, good." he said. "I would just like your general opinion of her 
competence, not anything that would border on prying into her affairs. I 
am always interested in first impressions of her. They seem to have a 
pattern to them, but as yet I have been unable to figure it out. To some, 
she seems distant, cold. To others, warm as a happy child in the spring. 
To others in other ways. But all are impressed with her.

"Now here is your chance to meet one of the Governing Masters. I 
recognize him by his gait, which is that of a man carrying a great book in 
his right hand."

I looked where he was pointing, and saw a small man coming towards us, 
bent over to one side as if he was carrying a bulky object. He waved at us 
and kept coming.

"Now here is a new boy for you, Merlinus. How would you like to meet 
Ordinary Master Benjamin Rowe, of the fleet of foot and slow of tongue. 
He is going to be introduced formally to the queen tonight, and he's a little 
nervous."

I said I was honored to meet the Governing Master.

He waved his hand. "None of that junk among us, my boy. Save it for our 
stuck up action master, who worries about such things. We scholars have 
our own ways of doing things, do we not?"

I agreed that this was so.

Suddenly it got dark, and the master stopped speaking. Then he said "Oh 
dear, another of her announcements. I would like it just as well if she left 
the lights on. Sometimes I think she does it just to annoy me."

A voice said, "The receiving lines will open in ten minutes. get to your 
places you laggards!" then the lights came up again, and we returned to 
our conversation.

"So your going to see our queen for the first time. I trust our good master 
Thrace here has been filling you in on the protocol?"

"His advice was to keep my mouth shut, and get ready to duck if spoken 
to.", I said.

The older man laughed, "So I did, Governor."

"Well, it's good advice, at the best of times. She seems much calmer this 
year than last, but those christians are causing her so much trouble, filling 
up the aura with that junk they live for, that she can't help a good pagan 
out without someone getting outraged about it. I take it you are not a 
Christian?"

"No, I avoided that trap, for the most part." I said.

But there's one other thing you should know about her, to set her in 
perspective. She's a tough bitch, but that's because she has to stay here 
in the earth all the time, while her mother gets to travel all over the place. 
If you are from somewhere exotic, like that new boy of ours -- What's his 
name, Thrace?"

"Master Benjamin Rowe, Governor."

"That's you? Oh dear. Well you may have more than you bargained for 
tonight then. She likes them exotic, and hasn't yet let a new man out of 
her bed. I hope you like them intense, from what I hear."

I said, "I don't think I'm ready for that, yet. Is there anyway to get out of it 
gracefully?"

"Not on your life there isn't, unless you come before her with bleeding 
wounds. Nothing short of that would keep her from inflicting a few wounds 
of her own. You'll just have to harden yourself and come along. But you 
have a better chance with her that way than you would any other. She 
doesn't expect the exotics to see her the way we residents do."

I thanked him for his advice, and asked him if we had perhaps met before, 
in a small apartment in Atlanta.

He said, "Not that I know of. Must have been another scholar of my type. 
There's a lot of us around here. How long ago would this have been, in 
your world?"

I said it was around 1973, which would make it 12 years before. 

But then the lights went out again, and I saw that the receiving line was 
forming. The angel told me to excuse myself and get into the line.

I excused myself from the two master magicians, and went towards the 
door to the hall in the tow of the angel.

"Now just remember to be calm, and you'll be all right. Just go right up to 
the bottom of her dais, bow, wait ten seconds, rise, and if she doesn't 
speak in that time, just turn on your heel and walk to the end of the line 
nearest the door, and take your place on the left."

I heard a sound of trumpets from within the greater hall. The angel said, 
"Get in line after that boy there. He is the youngest of the nobility being 
presented today in that capacity, and as the only guild man being 
presented today, you rank right after the nobility."

The boy being pointed to was a young one, about ten years old, and not 
yet over four feet in height. He said hello as I approached, and we talked 
as the line moved forward.

He said that his name was Gwayan, and that he was here because he 
was the first male heir of his father, and so had to be present when his 
father could not be. So he had to come and learn about the court early in 
life, so that he would understand what to do.

I told him my little story, and said that I still wasn't sure what my duties 
were. So he said that the magicians usually did the monitoring of the 
energies for the old woman, and that the queen of night only had a few on 
loan to take care of local matters here. But he had heard that a new 
magician was going to the palace of the queen;s mother in the next few 
days, and he supposed that would be me. I said that was what I had 
heard too, but it didn't help.

At this point, I was getting fatigued, and decided to allow my twin to 
continue on his own, without my interference.

I closed the vision and went to bed.

12/26/85
7:07 pm

The square "n" of the Earthy Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet.

I invoked the forces of earth using Crowley's preliminary invocation, and 
the fourth key. I then invoked the angel of the square, Nucareca. He 
appeared, and gave the LVX signs in response to the 5=6 signs. His head 
was human but with a very strong aspect of bullishness to it. His eyes and 
his robe were blue in color, and the tops of his feet could be seen to be 
black.

He said: "Go to your word-machine, and we will begin."

I did so.

We were standing in the pyramid, on the north and south sides of a beam 
of light that speared down from the top of the pyramid, and formed a 
square of light on the floor with the letter of the tablet shadowed on it. The 
beam appeared to spread, and soon covered the whole of the base of the 
pyramid, lighting it brightly and evenly. The angel still stood before me.

"Now that you are ready, let me say that it is to your very best interests to 
continue these visions to the end, even if they seem to you to be getting 
out of hand, for many things will not be seen until the last of the squares, 
where the earth presents herself in her glory and love.

"Tonight, we will look at some of the things that you have seen over the 
last month and a half, and try to summarize the intent of it all.

"First, there was the intent to satisfy your demands as to consistency and 
verifiability in the visions. That is, the visions had to meet more or less 
rigid classifications of events and symbolic design.

"This had to be done in order to establish that the visions were at their 
base valid visions of the squares in question. We understand the need for 
such, and had no objection to doing so.

"In order to get the points across, we had to divide them up so that some 
part could be seen in each of the related squares of the subangles. Some 
of one vision might be shown in yod of yod of heh final, and the rest 
shown in parts down through yod of heh final of heh final. Now you 
understand why some of the parts repeated themselves, such as the 
incarnation vision of the fiery angle becoming the star-vision of the air 
angle. And so on through these last squares, which sum up the tablet and 
reveal the missing pieces of what has gone before.

"Tonight, since we are in water of earth of earth, we are concerned with 
the designs of things, the formal plans on which they were based.

"The will aspect was shown in the squares of yod in the lesser angles. 
This began with the injection of the fire into the earth in the fire subangle, 
through its absorption and dispersion in the water angle, to its 
reappearance in the air angle as the etheric body, and final reward here in 
the earth angle, as you were given the acknowledgement that you had 
conquered the fires of earth, and were their master.

"Now, in the watery square here, we are looking over the course of all that 
has been run and look to see what comes ahead, as the mother does 
absorb the father, and make him to become a multitude of sons.

"The water angles and squares here have been concerned primarily with 
the absorbing and distributing aspects of the waters, that is, their ways of 
giving form to the formless fires, and their ways of sending these forms on 
into the world. We noted in all the quarters that the waters were making 
the fires into another form, of a type which could survive in direct contact 
with the earth. This is why the fires of the father in the tree, the supernal 
triad, can not reach into the lower earth. The middle triad, with the path of 
Scorpio on the hypotenuse, represent the farthest reaching of the father 
into matter. But even here, he is only touching the mother's inner center, 
which is Tiphereth, and is not reaching any where near to the daughter. 
The mother has to produce the son, which is the lowest triangle, with Vau, 
6, on the hypotenuse. Only the son touches the earth directly. The mother 
and the father remain in their places. Thus does the earth maintain the 
stability of all.

"This is as you found yourself, in your works upon the Tree of Life. Let it 
be so that you always discover that which you need."

I considered this information, and saw that it would require a few 
adjustments in my previous presentation on achad's cabala.

"But not so many as you would think, my sun. For the things of the earth 
are ever of the earth, while the things of the heavens revolve around them 
in their glory. Just so do the symbols within the tablet of earth remain 
there in their validity."

"This means that if you find something to be true here, do not immediately 
change it, but consider. You have thought, for instance, that this 
information about the father, mother and son indicates that the path of 
heh should really be the path the crosses the tree between chokmah and 
Binah. "

(The angel suddenly disappeared, as did hathor, and I was left alone in 
the pyramid. I waited.)

"Now, as I was saying, in this particular case, we can not make an 
interpretation that will fit fully with your tree as you have known it. But at 
the same time, your Tree remains valid. You may want to change one or 
two things in your own interpretation, particularly thinking as you have of 
the positions of the elements in the quarters of the sun." 

"Please bear with us. We have some distracting things going on here, 
which you will see shortly. Take a break."

I did so for a few minutes.

"In the air squares, did we see the father reappear as the son, who is then 
given into the daughter's embrace. In the fire quarter was the air fitted to 
the stresses of earth, meaning that the intent of the will must match the 
capabilities of the matter being worked upon. In the water quarter was the 
form turned into the essence of the coming idea. In the air quarter the 
idea was put into the minds of men, and here in the earth quarter will it 
see its fruition."

"Now, of the marriages seen in the squares of earth within the quarters, 
the less said the better at this time, for these are the harbingers of the end 
of the matter, and will soon come upon you in their fullness. Let your mind 
be at rest though, for you will not come to any harm, no matter the degree 
of intensity you experience here tonight."

"It was also our intent in these visions, to give you a taste of what lies 
before you in your future explorations. These tablets of the elements are 
meant as much for the initiation of Man as are the calls of the greater 
Aires, and there is a way within all of them for man to reach to the skys 
and pull down a star. You have seen much, if you will look over these 
visions in your papers, and much more will come of it if you allow it to be 
so. I know your resistance is based as much upon suspicion as it is upon 
rational resistance, and it is not so much as you feel it to be, so do not 
take bad heart that you sometimes feel you must reject what we say. It is 
simply that your mind, as with  anyone's, is not immediately adaptable to 
unique situations and experiences, and requires time to make itself at 
home with new information. If you ever feel a need for more information 
from these squares of earth, you need only come back again and we will 
see to your needs.

"For this time, simply allow things to take their course, and a good course 
you will see it to be in the end."

"Now to go on to other things, The first of these visions of the earth 
subangle showed you the men of the earth with whom you will work in 
coming years. These are men both incarnate and discarnate, who have 
had a mind to the powers that flow around the earth, and a mind to 
understand and make use of them. They are not all magicians, and many 
would not recognize even that they are a part of this group, but all share 
that deep interest in the powers of earth. Many of the discarnate ones 
attempt to follow the course of an energy all the way through its passage 
in the earth, in order to discover more about the dynamics of such 
processes. Others watch the heavens, and look for new energies that 
might usefully be brought into the system.

"Many others oversee the functioning of these energies within the earth, 
and see that they do not upset the balance too far to recover from. And 
finally, others take the energies into themselves, and take them into the 
world to be used. Of these last are you, as you are of the first as well.

"Thus we have the four grades of matter represented even within the 
ranks of those who are its masters. for those must also fit themselves to 
the needs and available energies, and therefore are of the four types 
available. Had there been other major energies within the earth's field at 
its creation, there would have been others to fit its needs.

"Thus it is also for the other tablets of the world of Enoch. Now your own 
position within this field is to be one of the first, who has decided to 
become one of the last, as a change of direction. This will have little effect 
on your long-run evolution, but in the short run, it is a strange way to take 
things. Usually, those who escape from the earth seek to make uses of 
the energies of the other tablets, thinking them higher, and never return 
here to earth. But you have come from the fires of the father, down into 
the planes of earth, and back up again, yet still you return to the earth, for 
the fires of your being have their origin in the friction of matter and spirit, 
and you wish to have full control over that matter in the coming stages of 
your work.

"You know that we can not tell all that you would wish to know about 
yourself and your future in the time allotted to us here. While you think of 
things to ask, if any, let me continue in another vein.

"In the visions of the last few days, you have seen yourself, as you 
thought, in the court of the queen of night, who is the queen of the quarter 
of earth within the earth tablet. The other angles have their governors, but 
the queen is the only one of her kind, being identical with her mother 
within her sphere of action."

"Thus it is also with the mother Nuit, and the daughter Babalon. The latter 
is the crystallization of the former into the worlds of matter. Thus she is 
also the scarlet woman, or the scarlet woman is her, rather, and she takes 
into herself the things of the man, while he goes out to the mother. Thus is 
it said that every drop of blood must be shed into her cup. There is much 
more to see on this in the angles of the water tablet, for that is where the 
mother is at her greatest power, yet here she also has some say, and has 
shown you the ways of this.

"Now the mother of the queen of night is nameless in her essence, and 
formless in her being, yet she is seen by all in as many ways as there are 
people to see. For she is the great formless giver of form, who takes not 
of that which she gives, but passes all on to her sons and daughters.

"You have seen her here primarily as Nuit, for that is the ultimate of the 
mother aspect in your system, the infinite circumference that draws in on 
the infinitesimal center."

"Yet also is she Isis, as you have seen in the one square of that water 
tablet we had you do, and so also is she Nepthys, Isis's twin, who is ever 
the dark and mysterious to complement Isis in her openness and lack of 
mystery. Thus do the two sides of the mother come together. Yet she has 
more sides than this yet. For the mother is also any goddess who has 
shown herself to be fertile, and thus do all goddess' come to us in the 
end, for there is not one who will retain the virgin state. Yet some are 
more virginal than others in their basic nature, and continue to rule in that 
way despite their own change."

"Now, the daughter in her place will be explained to you more, as has the 
father, and as will be the son. Let yourself continue in these visions in the 
end, as we have urged, so that the story does have an ending in the 
palaces of the queen."

"Go ye to the ends of the earth, and give joy that ye have come here, and 
give greater joy at what ye have received, and greater joy yet for what is 
to come."

I did this, flying to the corners of the earth tablet, and giving a little speech 
of thanks in each one.

"Now go you and take another break, for there is just a little more to be 
seen."

The light in the pyramid closed down to a narrow beam again. I quit the 
vision and got some more refreshments. I took a couple of puffs on my 
pipe, lit a cigarette, and returned to the pyramid.

I called upon the angel and he appeared, saying: "Ol sonuf vorsag, gohu 
Iad balata, elonusaha caelazod vonupeho."

I saw that he had his arms out in front of him in the sign of the enterer, 
and had them pointed at me. He continued with his invocation of the 
highest while he looked at me and smiled.

From his fingers shot out a sort of force that I could not see clearly. It 
seemed to be some sort of anti-light, with no perceptible color or lack of 
color at all. Yet its path could be sensed, and it seemed to be going past 
my left shoulder. I turned to see.

It was hitting the sigil of the earth on the south side of the tablet, right in 
the middle of the cross. As it hit, it clung to the sign, without being 
absorbed into it. Then the earth suddenly gave way somehow, and the 
force moved into it fully, covering the whole wall with some strange 
intensity or accentuation of appearance.

"Now you see that the daughter never gives in fully to the father on the 
very first touch, for there is always the resistance of matter to be 
overcome, and this applies on the human as well as the mechanical levels 
and spiritual levels. Thus the resistance of the woman is appropriate to 
her state, as is her later succumbing to the force of the male. the son 
takes the daughter, but it is the mother and father who complete the act. 
They change their state by their union, so that the son and daughter 
disappear, leaving behind a new mother and father to produce a new son 
and daughter. thus is there a movement upward in the elements, and in 
the tree of life, for the matter of the earth becomes to the magician the 
creative tool by which he works his will. And the mind of the son, the air, is 
become the will of the father. Thus the virgin of the sign of the virgin 
becomes the holy mother in the opposite sign, Pisces, and the 
scatterbrained son becomes the one-pointed Archer in Gemini and its 
opposite.

"In the fixed signs, we have the daughter as matter in motion, with its 
consequent moment of inertia keeping it traveling along its line of 
movement. Like a bull, it does not stop. It is changed only by death, which 
to the bull is the end of his work, and to the moving earth is its dissolution 
in the waters, its erosion into its basic components. Likewise does the air 
of the distributive sign of Aquarius, with its concern for the masses, 
become the self-centeredness of the opposite sign of Leo.

"Similarly for the cardinal signs, within their own sphere. The earth, 
Capricorn, with its rigid structures and restrictions, becomes the mother 
by the addition of feeling, Cancer, which is its one great lack. and the son 
of Libra, who shifts back and forth, becomes the instantly-acting father of 
the sign of aries, who can see and do with the same act.

"Now the signs of the zodiac, in their fours, have been one of the ways in 
which you have interpreted the meaning of your name, which is so deep 
of symbolism that even you do not know all. How you came by it is a story 
in itself, though from the mundane side there would seem nothing odd in 
it.

"But I let myself be sidetracked. In these fours have you found the key to 
your own advancement through the passages and spheres of the Tree of 
Life, even up to the edge of the abyss, and somewhat over it. Now we 
have shown these fours to be another key to your own tree, which you 
can now consider in some fuller detail than you have previously. We 
realize that this will be a lot more work for your mind, and we do not 
sympathize in the least with any complaints about it, for you know you can 
not help but consider what is placed before you.

"The other ideas we have given you in the course of these visions, that is, 
of the incarnation of the life into matter, and of the other things along the 
ways, are simply a matter of giving you what you need to have for your 
next stage of growth, which is to full star-consciousness. If not from us, 
then in another way would you have had these things. 

"And even though we have lead you again to your star in the course of 
these visions, the star was only there because you have already earned 
the right to commune and be one with it. If you had not, then these visions 
would have been much different. Everything here in these visions has a 
purpose, can you only divine it. Even to the manner in which we speak. 
Look you to your records after the course is over, and see if what is 
shown is not consistent throughout.

"Go now to your rest, and see us again when you have time to do the next 
of the visions, whether this be tonight, tomorrow, or several days. We will 
all be here and ready.

"Goodbye."

The vision ended, and I closed the astral temple and returned fully to my 
body, ending at about 9:00 pm.


12/28/85 12:00 pm

Square "c" of the Earthy Lesser Angle 
of the Tablet of Earth. 

Air of Earth of Earth. Angel, carecanu. God Anubis.

I invoked the forces of earth by the general invocation in Crowley's book, 
and then invoked the spirits of the tablet using the fourth key. 

The pyramid appeared, showing its east and west faces in a canary 
yellow color, with the air sigil thereon, and the north and south faces in the 
black of earth, with sigils.

I called upon the angel of the square again, and he appeared, wearing a 
yellow robe whose shade matched the pyramid sides, and with his skin 
and eyes of a black color.

I called upon the god of the tablet, and he appeared as well, showing the 
jackal head with yellow nemyss, violet straps and yellow apron.

I did the 5=6 signs to them, and the god and angel answered with the LVX 
signs, followed by the signs of Earth and Air. I tested them with the 
pentagrams and found them to be genuine.

I noted that the light within the pyramid seemed to be a combination of a 
glowing green with the yellow of air. The god said: "This is the growing 
green of fertile earth, not the black of the lifeless earth. For here in the 
earth's own lesser angle is she a goddess of growth and nurture, and a 
sustainer of the things of life."

The angel invited me to rise up out of the tablet into the outer airs of the 
square. I did so, and found myself high in the air over some mid-american 
farmland, with all the fields plowed and ready for the planting. Squares of 
turned earth could be seen stretching out to the horizon in all directions.

"This is the air within the growing earth," said the angel, "for the turning of 
the earth in the preparation for the planting is the adding of the air to the 
earth, their mixing so that the earth does breathe with the needed prana 
to incite the seeds of fire to grow.

"Now we have seen this field before, in the last of the squares of the angle 
of fire, and now we see them again in their fullness, for the planting here 
is yet to come, and will be of the last square of this angle.

"Now let us rise some more, and see what else awaits us."

We rose, and the earth receded below us, disappearing into darkness 
after a few moments. Now the light and images seemed to come from 
above us, from the airs between the stars.

"Just as we earlier showed you how the airs that are given off by the body 
of man were of the air of earth, so now do we show you that on these 
higher levels are there also airs breathed forth by their living makers. All 
the stars that you see, including your sun, are the emitters of the solar 
wind, which is a wind of charged particles and nuclei, blowing outwards in 
all directions from their origin.

"Now the earth also breathes out, and the gases of her breathing are the 
airs of the ethyr, which are given out unto the other planets of the solar 
system for the use of the gods who are creating there.

"This Air of Earth of Earth does give to those planets the potential for 
manifestation of life, as it has done to the earth. Yet the planets in 
themselves are not the normal habitat of life, and therefore must the life 
make its own place within those other worlds. This will come to pass if 
man allows himself the effort to travel and colonize these other planets of 
the system. They will give to those who live upon them the image of their 
own lives, and take from them the life of earth, which will change their 
ability to create on the material plane, and make their creation of fullness, 
through the intervention of man.

"Thus does the potential of earth reach outwards into the system, and to 
the stars for whom she has labored in this world of rock and hardness.

"Up until recently was the earth a planet in closure, cut off from her friends 
and associates of the stars. Yet now, in this present time, does she 
reaffirm her connection with them, so that their force can come down, and 
change her into that which she wishes to be.

"As the result of her new contacts with the larger worlds, the earth will 
become as the other sacred planets of the solar system, an equal to them 
within the powers of the sun's field.

"Go ye unto the ends of the earth, and declare that the earth has come to 
her inheritance, and is come to take her place within the greater worlds 
again."

I did this, going to the corners of the tablet of earth, and calling out an 
invocation to the stars and worlds at each corner, announcing the coming 
of the earth unto the stars again. Then I returned to the pyramid. 

Within the pyramid, my astral body immediately formed the image of the 
God Anubis, looking from his place at the north of the floor, southwards to 
where I had stood before. The god chanted some words in a tongue I did 
not recognize, and could not reproduce. The god extended his arms, and 
there appeared in his left hand an ankh, colored violet, and in his right 
hand a lotus wand, also colored violet.

"Thus you see me as I am, o man. for the life of the earth does ever die, 
within the aspect of the mother, in order to produce here in the son the 
many lesser forms that will cause the life to manifest within the earth. I 
myself do carry these segments of life from here to there within the field of 
earth. Transferring the ends of the will from their place of origin, unto their 
place of rest. Thus am I called a god of death, for the death does make of 
the life to fragment, and it is those fragments of life, which are the air, that 
I do transfer through the realms of night unto a new day in a greater 
world.

"The wand is a sign that my will is single, and devoted to the purposes of 
life. The ankh of course is the sign of that which I control and transport. 

"Now here in this last of the squares of air within the earth tablet, do we 
take the seeds, which were planted in the angle of fire, and given their 
supporting structures by the waters, and separated into components in 
the air angle, and we do place these seeds within the final square of 
earth, which the the next square to come. Do ye go now unto the pyramid 
of the earth, and see what is there. then return."

I rose up above the pyramid, and saw that it was in its place within the 
angle of earth. Next to it, on the edge of the tablet, was the square "r", 
earth of earth of earth. I did the sign of the enterer, and entered into that 
pyramid.

I could see through the walls, and saw the pyramid of the square "c" next 
to the one I was in. To the top of that pyramid did Anubis rise, until he was 
standing upon its summit. From the palms of his hands did come a glow, 
which bathed the pyramid in which I stood with the calm, violet light.

This violet light did engulf the pyramid, and set it to burning with a low, 
almost invisible flame. The heat intensified, and soon the walls of the 
pyramid were glowing also in that dark violet color. They seemed to swell 
with the force, and to interpenetrate with it.

I was raised up out of the pyramid of "r" and taken back to the pyramid of 
"c", where I joined Anubis on its top. We descended until we were inside 
again. He told me to call upon the angel of the vision again, and I did so.

The angel appeared again, and said: "The son has taken the daughter by 
his force, and made her to glow with the colors of her mother the moon, 
who does encourage her in the reception of the son's force. thus is the 
daughter raised up to the seat of the father, and does sit thereon in her 
wantonness.

"For without the son, the father could not come by the daughter, and all 
his force and power would be lost. He can not reach to her from his lofty 
height, and therefore must the son raise her up within his grasp.

"We have said that you are the son within these visions, and this is so. 
For you came unto this world to help the daughter to come back to her 
rightness within the worlds of the stars, and you did put yourself into her 
womb to be transformed. Now ye have come out again, and the daughter 
follows after you in your travels.

"Since ye have chosen the side of rightness, and gone down into matter 
only with the goal of bringing her up to your level, so then has the earth 
cooperated in your quest, and given you that which you need to raise her 
in her glory to the stars.

"You have not seen all that there is to see in this square, yet it would be 
best if you go and wait for a few hours before you continue. For these 
things we deal with here are best absorbed a little at a time, to allow the 
way for a larger vision in the second invocation.

"See that ye have all aright within your temple, and within yourself. For we 
have that to be seen which will be of great force, and will need the best of 
your will to keep it in the path of its best manifestation. Take your will to 
do the invocations again at the time of sunset or thereabouts today, and in 
the meantime, continue to review what has come before. For there is 
much more to be seen.

"Close the vision now."

I banished the forces and closed the astral temple.

6:30 pm

The forces of the square were invoked, and the names vibrated.

(The temple seemed a little bit changed tonight. Where it normally is a 
large domed room, with columns circling it under the edge of the dome, 
tonight it seemed as if the columns had been rearranged to bring the 
center of the circle closer to the eastern wall of the temple.

The pyramid appeared, showing black on the north and south, and yellow 
on the east and west. The correct sigils were on the sides.

I vibrated the name of the angel again, and of the god of the square, 
Anubis, and waited. Anubis appeared on the top of the pyramid, standing 
facing the east with his arms crossed on his chest, and the ankh and lotus 
wand in his hands.

I gave the 5=6 signs, and he answered with the same, and then with the 
signs of Set and Shu, and the signs of LVX. I tested him with the 
pentagrams and letters, and he was not affected.

My consciousness entered into the body of the god, and I saw myself 
standing in the sign of Osiris slain, and the door to the outside behind me.

Anubis said, "Let us go out upon the terrace of the temple, where we may 
stand in the light."

The god went to the door, gathering up my astral body in passing, and 
performed the sign of the Enterer. The doors burst open, and we flew out 
and away from the temple, ending on a platform suspended in the air 
about a mile away. I looked back at the temple, and saw that it was on the 
top ridgeline of a series of peaks, and stuck out into a valley with steep 
sides, much like Yosemite. The floor of the valley was made of long 
meadows, with copses of pines between them.

The platform stuck out into the air from the opposite side of the valley, it 
appeared, and represented the place of the sun in the east at the 
equinox. 

"In the bringing in of the force of air to the temple, this is the place where 
one must stand to direct the force there. For one can not stand within the 
earth, which is the temple, and direct the outer forces into her from there. 
You must first find a place to stand outside of her aura. Then you can 
have the leverage to bring something new into her sphere."

"Now observe as I fill the temple with force."

Anubis stood there, facing the temple, with his arms thrown outwards and 
downwards in an upside-down "v". The ankh was in his right hand and the 
lotus wand in his left.

He breathed deeply a few times, as if to absorb the force of the air. Then 
he blew, his arms snapping forward in the sign of the Enterer. With all his 
will he sent his consciousness forward, throwing the forces of air against 
the temple.

Yet as the forces hit the side of the temple, they seemed to hit a barrier. 
They clung to the barrier for a moment, and then entered through a hole. I 
saw the hole to be the invoking hexagram of air, with its two triangles fit 
base-to-base.

Inside the barrier the forces gather, but there was still an area within the 
temple that the god could not reach into. It was shaped like a round 
pantacle, with a width about five times its thickness.

The air settled about this pantacle, and seemed to calm. The god 
withdrew himself from the air, and reassumed his form.

"Thus the airs are able to breach the inner temple, but are never able to 
penetrate the earth in her fullness. Thus the airs must settle about her, 
and cloak her, rather than mixing with her.

"But the airs, by their constant movement, do create on the surface of the 
earth a roughness, a reducing of the solidness, and within this semi-solid 
surface, the soil, does the air plant the life of the father."

I saw that the surface of the pantacle was becoming fuzzy, undefined, as 
if it was sublimating into gas. Then the picture changed, and I was 
hovering again above the mid-american farmland of the previous vision of 
the square. I saw that the surface we used, the soil, was the less-defined 
area about the pantacle in the previous image. It was earth broken up so 
that the air could enter.

The picture darkened as we rose up and went into space, hovering above 
the atmosphere of the earth. Then the god said, "We must go higher yet, 
o man, for the earth's air, its ether, extends far beyond what seems to be 
the edge of the air."

We continued to go outwards until we we about halfway to the moon's 
orbit, and took a position above the north pole of the earth. I observed 
that we were in the low-energy funnel of the magnetic torus surrounding 
the earth.

Then below I saw flashes of light around the pole, and understood this to 
be the aurora, which is the glowing of particles excited by the solar wind.

"Thus the air of the sun's wind touches the earth. It can not enter the 
earth, due to the magnetic field, except here at the pole. Then the 
charged particles come down into the earth, exchanging their bits of the 
father's power and planting it into the earth.

"Similarly on higher levels, where the impulses of her masters in spirit can 
only come into the earth through the limited area surrounding the pole. 
Thus the placement of the pole is of importance to determining the type of 
energy coming into her. Each of the stars the pole's moves point to has a 
particular energy to manifest, and this comes into the earth's sphere via 
the northern pole.

"Now, other energies could get into her, if there was some way to move 
these energies around so that they would fall into the pole. The man who 
has freed himself of the earth can bring these energies in simply by being 
outside of the earth's aura for a while. He has motion, where the daughter 
is limited in her motions, and thus he can go and bring the energies back 
for her.

"He brings them primarily to the pole, because that is the easiest point of 
entrance. But if he is of enough power, and punches through the aura 
directly outward from his place on the earth, then he can bring the powers 
back by the path by which he went out, creating a new way of entry for the 
powers.

"We saw some of this back in the first of the angles of the tablet of earth, 
and in the image you later had of the adepts as sparks of fire orbiting her 
like the sperm about the egg, feeding powers into her.

"Now the earth herself benefits primarily from the energies coming into 
her from places other than the pole, for those that come to the pole enter 
in too destructively for their message to be read clear. Thus the adepts 
are her main connection with the outer universe in terms of the mind-
aspect. To her through them comes the message of the stars.

"Now in this time are the stars saying to her: `Come, daughter, awake and 
return to your place among us. For you have slept a long sleep, and the 
day is upon you again. The princes who have wakened you wait around 
you, waiting on your pleasure. Come, o queen of the night, rise unto a 
new day.'"

As the angel spoke these words, the vision opened up so that I saw the 
interior of a bedroom in what appeared to be a castle. There were large 
windows in what I took to be the east wall, and the south wall was all 
window, opening into a garden on a terrace. In the west wall I could see 
an entrance into a bath area. The north wall showed a large, iron-bound 
wood door.

On the bed lay a young woman, appearing to be about the age of sixteen 
or seventeen. She woke with an expression that implied something had 
called to her in her dreams and told her to wake. She rose from the bed, 
gathered a robe about her, and walked to the south wall.

The angel said:

"The queen arises from her bed on the first morning of winter, and sees 
through her window the head of a young man, who stands upon the wall 
of her palace, looking inward with curious eyes. He seems to her to be a 
tragic figure, yet one who has the grace to ignore his tragedy and get on 
with life. He seems to touch her with a sadness that makes her wish to 
comfort him, and give him peace and plenty."

I stand behind the girl as she looks out the window, and I can follow her 
gaze to a high wall to the left of the terrace. There seems to be a footpath 
on the top of the wall, and a man is standing there, looking into the garden 
with a thoughtful expression. A sudden rush of energy from the girl 
startles me, and distracts my attention. There is something very watery-
receptive about the feel of the energy from the girl.

"The man looks as if he wishes to enter, but is forbidden from doing so. 
So the queen, who wishes to speak to him, does call to her waiting 
women, and ask the nature of the man. They summon the court 
magicians, knowing not themselves who he is, but seeing his supernatural 
quality.

"The magicians also look out the window, and see the figure standing 
there, and his aloneness cries out to them, reminding them of their own 
pain in their separation from the common man.

"And yet they feel a brightness in him, a source of hope without end, a 
determination not to give in. And so he maintains his aloneness despite 
himself, for he knows it is to his pain to become close to his fellows. Yet 
this is not defeat, for he works yet to change himself, to make of himself 
that which he would wish to be, knowing the way in which his life should 
go. And they see that he has already changed himself once, and is very 
near succeeded in changing yet again.

"Now, this man is yourself, and this castle is the castle of the queen of 
night, and the day is the day a few days passed on which you invoked the 
force of the square of Air of Air of Earth.

"This queen who sees you is truly the Queen of the Night, and her vision 
of you is such that she must have you in her court despite all opposition. 
Yet withall her grace was fearful, for you have upon you the mark of 
death, and it has not yet healed. 

"She saw, though, in this mark of death, also the mark of greater life, and 
of the passage of earth into the spirit, and knew you for one of the magi. 
Thus she charged her magicians with getting you prepared, while she 
also prepared herself for this meeting. 

"First, you must be given a position within their framework, in which to visit 
and to converse with those of her level. Then you must be confirmed in 
this position by the other magi in her conference, so that there would be 
no jealousy among them, and so that they could signify their dissent if 
they wished.

"Then you must be presented to the court, and given into the hands of the 
courtiers, to see how your mettle fits with theirs. This has all been done, 
and now we are on the last leg of our presentation.

"You were next to have the situation explained to you, and be given an 
opportunity to assent or reject it as you would. Now we are at this point.

"The situation is this: The queen of night is enamored of your power as a 
man, and wishes to have you as a frequent visitor to her court, with the 
hope that one day you will come to live here as her king. She wishes you 
to know that this would in no way cause a delay in your advancement to 
other realms, and that she herself is due for her next initiation, and wishes 
to have you along with her.

"As to why she wishes this, I will let her teach you herself in the next 
vision. For this is of her own feelings, and only she can express it with 
fullness.

"Now, the choice is this, and it is not an arduous one, I am certain, for one 
of your tastes and personality. Let me take a moment to prepare myself, 
and get yourself a drink."

I did this and returned.

"The queen of night wishes to ask you to have her as your mistress within 
the worlds of men. This would entail her and you living together, and 
acting out the parts given to you by circumstances, while living at the 
same time on this other level.

By mistress she means all of the things that are normally connoted by that 
term within the worlds of men, including the sexual aspect, which she 
welcomes.

Now that you have given your assent to this, let me tell you how this will 
be done. Given that you are not going to put this paper into circulation 
without some form of evidence, you will be given that evidence. And the 
queen's alter-ego on earth will hear of you and wish to see your writings, 
and will contact you upon reading them. Much as you have assumed. But 
the proof will be of a separate nature, and will not depend on anything that 
you do yourself.

"In the meantime, she wishes you to visit her within her own world, and 
will make the effort to bring you over in your consciousness, to inhabit 
there in your astral bodies.

"You are resisting this idea, despite your agreement, and this will have an 
effect on things. Let yourself go on this one, and you will see things much 
better than you would normally.

"For the rest of the evening, just relax and do things as you would 
normally do. We have finished for now."

Square "r" of the Earthy Lesser Angle
of the Earth Tablet.

12/30/85

All day I have been having the sensation of being at the center of a 
sphere of force, in which there is no disturbance of any kind. This has not 
affected my usual emotions, but seems to be operating in a dimension 
different than that of my normal consciousness.

I have also been receiving some images connected with this last square 
of the tour of IHVH in Earth. Here are the notes, transcribed mostly 
between 10:00 am and 11:30 am today.

I called upon the angel of the tablet, and the goddess, Nepthys, to appear. 
The angel appeared first, all of a black color. His clothes and skin and hair 
were all black, but with yellow highlights that appeared and vanished in a 
moment.

The goddess appeared, with yellow skin, wearing black and white, with 
the moon crown on her head. She did the 5=6 signs, and followed this 
with the LVX signs and the sign of Set. She was not affected by the 
pentagrams or the letters.

"Know, o man, that here we come to the home of the daughter, who is the 
queen of night. In her palace are many things of brightness, and glory, 
and great strength. Also is the sign of the gods upon her, for it is through 
her that their creations are given into the earth for growth and husbandry. 
Truly she is a house of treasures, and a great joy of fullness to those who 
know her, and does give unto all according to their need and will."

Nepthys did a sign like the sign of the dying buddha, hands held palm to 
palm, and the head tilted to one side, resting upon them. There was a 
tremendous grace in the way the goddess performed this gesture, 
reminiscent of the ritual dancers of Thailand. "There is no lack of rest 
here, o man, and therefore are your comings and goings marked with 
great amusement among those who watch. Peace is of the earth, o man 
of fire, peace unutterable, rest, ecstasy. Nor is aught demanded in 
sacrifice. Let there be between you [and the earth] that knowing as of a 
man with his wife, and let this knowing join you to the earth, giving to you 
of her rest and ecstasy. And let her stability pervade your being, giving 
you the persistence of the Bull in your work of the tablets and the signs.

"Now know ye that existence is pure joy, that all the sorrows are as 
shadows, that they pass and are done. But there is that which remains 
after. And this is the source of that which is the stability of earth and the 
joy of man, the son."

Nepthys held her hands outwards and downwards, so that the arms 
describe an upright triangle, the reverse of the sign of Apophis. It is the 
sign seen in many images of the Mother Mary of the Catholics.

"This is the blessing brought upon the earth. For in the downward-pointed 
arms do the fires flow to the earth. Yet hidden in the sign is also the 
upright rising of the Father, who is awakened by the caresses of the 
Earth's daughters."

Now the vision opened outwards, and I saw around us fertile lands of 
every type, full of green growing things. And the hand of man was not 
seen within it, but only the endless permutations of the earth, giving unto 
the living from the depths of herself, causing every living thing to grow and 
multiply.

"As a mother does she nurture them, and the daughter does give of her 
own substance." said Nepthys.

The lands became filled with life, things springing up in an instant, 
reaching their full height, to be lost and replaced in a moment by things 
yet greener. And more and more did the greenness spread about the 
earth, transforming its brown to the emerald of life. The growth continued, 
and my viewpoint rose upwards, showing me the entire earth glowing with 
the emerald glow, a great jewel in the darkness.

Nepthys said, "Know ye that the powers of love do grow in the darkness 
of earth, and the earth herself will be love incarnate, when her rising into 
the heavens is completed. When she rises again to come among the 
stars, her place shall be as Aphrodite rising from the waves. She shall be 
as an eager virgin placed among the elder men of the stars, to renew their 
interest in matter.

"In the Stele [of Revealing] is she that altar placed between the priest-
worshiper and the god, from which the flowers of life do grow. Thus are 
the 4 fulfilled within the Stele of Revealing."

The vision altered, so that the stars above began to curl down upon the 
earth, and the sun became as a winged globe. And I stand myself in the 
guise of the priest Ankh-af-na-Khonsu, facing Ra-Hoor-Khuit on his 
throne. The earth springs up to become an altar between the two of us, 
and a lotus of some sort springs from the top of the altar. The altar then 
became the enochian cube of the universe, and the lotus springs from the 
nameless tablet that is the top of the cube.

Now I am outside the scene again, and I see the priest and god merge 
into the shape of the pentagon. Each bends to make up two sides, with 
the base of the altar between them making the fifth side, so that the 
cubical altar was within the pentagon. The pentagon rose up above the 
altar, and became a pentagram. The sigils of the elements appeared at 
their four apexes. The flame of the spirit descended on it from Hadit, 
giving Light and Life to the topmost point.

"Thus does the pentagram emerge from the square, as the god and the 
man are merged in the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy 
Guardian Angel. Within the Endlessness of Nuit, in this instance is Hadith 
the hidden light of Kether. Ra-Hoor-Khuit is the manifest expression of 
that light. And the priest-worshiper is the personality, the altar is itself the 
physical body, upon which do the gods work their will.

"Also is Hadith the monad, Ra-Hoor-Khuit the soul. All within the limitless 
limits of the Great Night of Nuit. Thus we have also the the Man of the 
Earth, the Lover, and the Hermit within the Stele. The 4 and the 3 
combine in the 7 which are 10, and in the 12 which are 1.56

"Now the four within the stele are also of the 4 of the Tarot, and do 
represent the elements in one form. T is Tau, Saturn, Binah, the Great 
Sea and the Great Dark, Nuit. A is Aleph, Air, the invisible spirit, Hadith. R 
is Rish, the Sun, fire, Ra-Hoor-Khuit. And O is Oin, Capricorn, the active, 
exalted earth Babalon.

"Also is T the earth, and A the mind of man, which regards it. R is the soul 
and O is the Eye of God, overlooking all. 

"In the first of these [two interpretations] the elements do revolve about 
their invisible center. In the second do they rise through the planes to the 
godhead. Thus in your Tree of Life do the elements revolve within the 
lower worlds, and within the hexagram of the Sun, while at the same time 
do the rise from the bottom to the top of the Tree through the Middle 
Pillar.

"In Taurus the Love of the Mother is shown, and Adonai her god is 
worshiped therein as Lord and King. Thus ye saw yourself yesterday as a 
great King, seated upon a throne, upon the Tablet of Earth. And the light 
of the Sun does cause the earth to become fertile, and to grow in fullness, 
as the grain does ripen in the summer sun.

"In the place of Virgo does the grain reach its full ripeness, and there must 
be a separation of the treasure of the grain from the roots of its source. 
Therefore is the fullness of earth shown here as the virgin rather than as 
the empress. She holds her treasure away from herself, to distinguish 
whether it be truly valuable. And the mind that rules her does discriminate 
that which is of worth from that which is not.

"In the winter does the earth become as the hardness of iron, and of 
stone, and barrenness rules the dark of the year. The goat leaps about 
his bare and rocky home, and plans for the green of spring which is to 
come.

"In the dark of the night are the seeds given into the earth, and their 
barrenness is made to be their preservation, until the light of Adonai again 
releases them from their rocky prison.

"The signs of the zodiac cycle in the earth in their way, moving from their 
place to the next in the equinox of the gods, but retaining in themselves 
their essential character. The movement of the signs is as a revolving of 
an idea in the heart and mind of a god, turning it this way and that to see it 
clear.

"We have spoken before about the way in which this precession does 
move the pole from place to place, thus determining which powers of the 
universe dominate in the earth's field in any era. But these forces must 
always act through the intervention of the signs of the zodiac, which are 
constant in their relations to each other and to the earth in which we live. 
For the signs are the mark of the cycles of Earth, and of the life of Adonai 
within it, and are as the first of the powers given unto man for his use.

"Now in the later stages of growth, as you have seen, Adonai ceases his 
endless path forward through the signs. He turns upon himself and begins 
winding his way back up the path by which he came to earth. This is the 
point in the vision of the god's reproduction where the lives withdraw their 
energy from the shells in which they live, and concentrate it in the centers 
of the shells. For in order to do thus, the life must reverse, or counter, the 
spin which the earth has given to its shell, so that it can stand free and 
stable. The act of will by which this reversal takes place is also the act by 
which his reversal on the wheel of the zodiac takes place.

"Eventually the man, who is himself Adonai, the light of the elements, has 
risen above the earth again, to stand with his cousins among the lesser 
stars of the Solar system. He finds himself fixed in place within the 
heavens, forced to examine the forces of those heavens as they appear 
to him. No longer the subjection of Adonai to the changing view within the 
earth. The power of his Genius holds him fixed.

"This second stage relates to the point in the aforementioned vision in 
which the units of force discard their shells, and support their place within 
the pressure of earth by their own counter-pressure. But still they reside 
within the earth's sphere.

Now in the third stage do the units separate themselves from the matter, 
and stand free as creators in their own right. Now do they administer in 
the earth as does the governor in the nation-state. So do they show 
themselves to be stars in the heavens, sending their will into the world of 
the daughter as the reawakened father does to his child. So do the signs 
of this stage within the zodiac hold to the name of "cardinal" signs. That 
is, "of the first".

"The other two stages are related to the zodiac as you have surmised and 
speculated. For the early stage of the man in the earth is as a mutable 
being, pulled this way and that by the forces around him.

"In the second stage is he fixed in place, learning about the forces by the 
friction of his unchanging nature against them. The third stage reverses 
the first, and the earth itself is pulled this way and that as it formerly pulled 
the man. 

"The arms of the mutable cross are made of waves, with no center point 
to them. The forces drag the man around as they pull in their unbalanced 
stages. In the second stage are the arms of the Cross rigid, fixed in place, 
with the strength of the columns of the force by which the man has held 
himself away from matter. In the third stage the cross becomes like unto 
the arrow head, aiming back down into matter by the force of will, from 
Being's place outside it."

(The mutable cross was shown like two intersecting sine waves, of 
varying frequency and amplitude. The fixed cross was like the enochian 
sigil of earth, save that the arms are solid black. The cardinal cross was 
shown as a Maltese cross.)

After transcribing the above, I went to my room to meditate and relax. I 
began to get images of myself as a prince, escorting a young princess to 
be presented to the elders. I got the impression that I and the girl were to 
be married, and the custom was to offer her first to the leaders of the 
(tribe/group/country/community) under the principle of "Droit de seigneur". 
The girl appeared to be relatively small, with white skin, wide hips, and 
slender legs and chest. Her hair was either cut above the shoulder, or 
pinned back so that the neck and shoulders were exposed. For some 
reason, I gathered that this was important.

She appeared to be a naturally graceful and modest person, without any 
trace of false modesty or useless social inhibitions. She knew she was 
there to be examined, and possibly fucked by, the elders. She felt it was 
their natural right to do so, and did not feel any objections to the process. 
Nor did she feel any doubts as to her ability to carry it out.

I presented her to the seniors present. Each examined her and found her 
to be acceptable. Then I led her to a nearby couch. Kissing her warmly, I 
lay her down, and folded back the slit of her dress so that she was 
exposed from the waist down. I touched her cunt lovingly until her 
lubricants began to flow. Then I kissed her again and stepped back.

The seniors formed themselves into a ring facing outwards, and tangent 
to the couch. The girl slid down to the end of the couch, so that her 
bottom was even with the edge, and spread her legs straight out to the 
sides, without bending the knees.

In turn, each of the seniors came forward and touched his penis to the 
girl's vagina. As they did so, an aura began to form around her. When this 
occurred, the seniors sped up the rotation of their circle, and eventually 
came up to a speed where they all blurred together, except for the senior 
who was with the girl at the moment.

(I realized later that this image showed the transformation of the earth into 
the power of love, as was mentioned in the day's earlier vision. It shows it 
in a fairly explicit form, as well. The seniors are of course the other 
planets of the solar system, as the seniors represent the planets in the 
Enochian Tablets. So we have the circulating energies of the planets (the 
ring of seniors) being applied to the earth (the Tau-cross formed by the 
girl's torso and legs), and the combination forming the symbol of Venus. 
This is a basic formula of one type of sex magick, as will be seen later.)

In the vision, a voice said: "Thus does the earth become Love incarnate. 
(pause) This is also the awakening of the father by the son's presentation 
of the daughter, as was mentioned in the previous visions."

As all the seniors presented their powers to the girl, I saw her change so 
that I could see the chakras within her body. As each senior applied 
himself to her, a chakra would glow brighter for a moment, and retain 
some of the extra glow.

All of the chakras were bright. I noted that the third from the bottom 
glowed a bright green. The lowest was red, the next was a sort of brown-
orange color. The heart center was gold-yellow, the throat center a light 
sky-blue. The ajna center was a dark purple or violet, I forget which, with 
white flashes going through it. The chakra at the top of the head was 
extremely intense, but colorless.

As the chakras intensified, I also saw that the rest of her aura was 
remarkably clean and free of defects. It was completely transparent 
except for the chakras, and a thin cord of light connecting them. The 
image of her physical body faded for a few moments, so that all that was 
left was the body of light, with the chakras centered in it.

The seniors completed their actions, and I knew that the next step was to 
fuck her myself. I moved to the couch, and looked down at her. She still 
felt as innocent and accepting as at the beginning of the vision. As I 
entered her, both of our bodies transformed into bodies of light as 
described above.

There followed several images that seem to relate to forms of sex magick, 
about which I know little. I was not familiar enough with the techniques of 
that kind of magick to know whether what was said is valid from the 
viewpoint of systems built around sex magick.

From somewhere I was told some general points about the process.

First, the act must continue long enough for the auras of the two parties to 
become charged up. Without this, there is not enough force to produce a 
result. This charging is not the same as the basic animal excitement of the 
act, but more like the way the aura gets charged by a ritual, except that 
the charge is produced entirely by the sex act.

Second, there must be a merging of the auras, so that both the man and 
woman reside within a single extended aural ambience. The chakras 
themselves do not merge, except sometimes at the completion. If one 
party or the other resists the merging, then the act is also likely to fail, or 
to produce unwanted results.

Third, each party must be able to identify him/herself with the main 
instruments of the act.

Fourth, that the type of force generated by the basic technique depends 
on how far up the yoni's chakras the force is allowed to go. Since the 
chakras relate mainly to planetary forces, the basic forces available will be 
of a planetary nature. But other forces can be invoked by their relation to 
the planets.

Then the two bodies of light, which were myself and the girl, were shown 
in various relations and activities, which I presume to be a method of sex 
magick.

In the first technique, the force of the lingam rises up the yoni's column to 
a particular chakra, which is visualized by the yoni as the location of her 
womb. Both visualize the rising of the force and its concentration in the 
chakra. After completion of the act (it does not have to be completed in 
one session), the force is ejected into the yoni's real womb, from which 
the lingam recovers it as in the eucharist. 

The word "circulation" was specifically associated with the next technique. 
The force rises as in the previous example, but instead of being 
concentrated in the chakra, it passes through the chakra to the outer 
portions of the Yoni's aura, from whence it "percolates" back down to the 
lowest chakra, only to be swept up again into the rising forces. As before, 
the participants enjoy the eucharist after the act.

The second form of circulation is the classic "69" position, in which each 
participant's throat chakra is connected to the partner's lowest chakra, 
with the circulation going down the spinal columns, being absorbed there 
into the partner's throat chakra, and recirculated. "Thus does the snake 
eat his own tail", says a voice.

The last form shown was a variation on the first three, but requiring 
greater concentration. In this form, the magicians both identify their 
mundane personalities with the generative organs, while their magickal 
personalities assume god-forms and perform full rituals on the astral 
planes. The force is reabsorbed as in the original versions.

The more coherent visions ended here, though there were small flashes 
of images continuing for several hours afterwards. I get the feeling that 
there is more to be done in this last kerubic square of the tablet, but that 
the time is not right yet. Or perhaps the rest of the force will manifest in 
some other way. In either case, this is the end of the visions of IHVH in 
Earth for the present.

1/11/86 2:22 pm

Did a general invocation, and an invocation of earth, followed by the calls 
and the names for this square "r" of the Earthy Lesser Angle of the Earth 
Tablet.

The pyramid appeared around me, with all the sides black, with the 
enochian sigil of earth and the sign of Taurus on each side. I did the sign 
of Set, and called upon the Goddess Nepthys to appear. She did so, 
giving the Sign of Set, and the signs of 5=6 and LVX in response to my 
salute. I tested her with the pentagrams and letters, which had no effect 
on her.

She said: "Welcome again, o man, to the last of the Kerubic squares of 
earth. This is to be your last trip here for a while, while you do other 
things, and so we must clear up the last of the points needed to clarify 
your duties to this tablet.

"Now you have been given to understand that you are to be the mate of 
the earth, in a very special way, which is in the way of raising her up again 
into the spirit. This is your task, and your task alone, and what other 
magicians do in this area is not to be of your concern.

"Now this mating is to be in the physical world, as we have stated before, 
but this mating is not the mating of the male and the female humans, but 
the mating of the spirit of man, yourself, with the spirit of the earth. And 
out of this mating will come the ability to manifest fully on the physical 
plane those conceptions of the spirit that are needed for this work.

"These conceptions in the mind of the man, of bringing into the earth 
things of the spirit, by direct manifestation, is of the nature of the seventh 
ray in the Theosophical system that you do know, and is of the area of 
Malkuth in the Tree, and of Earth in the elements, and of Saturn in the 
planets, though this latter is less so than the three former.

"This is the form of life in matter, the making of the earth out of the akasha 
and out of the astral and etheric substance, without the intervention of 
material tools and works. How you will do this will become clear to you as 
your practice progresses.

"Think of yourself as the spirit, and the earth-spirit as the matter of the 
work, and take your will upon her. For the earth requires a strong master 
in order to best reveal her secrets to men. Without strength, then does the 
earth's inertia overcome the power of the magician, and make him to be 
as the wind blowing about the earth without penetration.

"Thus you will treat the earth with the severe discipline of the master in 
your dealings of magick within her sphere. This is the way of the earth, 
that she is passive to the will of the magician, and does nothing of her 
own accord. Yet does she follow him willingly when the right force is 
applied.

"You will draw the earth out of herself, and into the heavens, by the force 
of your will, and you will hold her there until she sees the light of her father 
the sun, who is god within the solar system, and takes that light unto 
herself as a garment of exceeding beauty and wondrousness.

"Stand ye on the edge of the earth, as you have done so often in the past, 
and call her out by the force of your will. See that this is done, and so 
shall she come out to you, and thank you for her release, with the rewards 
to be given by her hand.

"Let in not be thought that these rewards will only be in the spirit. For in 
the physical bodies as well shall these rewards manifest themselves to 
you. And all shall be well."

Now we stood upon a platform at the edge of space, and I did look down 
upon the earth, and the earth did look upon me. And I said: "Come out, o 
goddess, awaken and come out to me. For the time has come for you to 
return unto your fathers, and the appointed one has come to escort you to 
their abode.

"Come out, o goddess, and array yourself in blue and gold, like unto your 
mother Nuit. Come out, and stand here with me on the edge of the stars, 
and breathe deeply of the things of the spirit. For your time of isolation is 
at an end, and the stars do wish your spirit among them."

"Come ye, come ye, come ye! For your mother has come, and bears your 
garments with her, that you might be clothed in finery and riches before 
the seniors of the stars. Come out, come ye out, and take your fill of love 
and will! Come out, come ye out, and take your fill of life and light! And 
your days shall be as the seasons of the moon, and your nights shall be 
as the days of the sun.

"Let your soul come out to me, who stands here at the edge of chaos, and 
calls to you. Give your spirit into my keeping, for the day of your return is 
at hand! Come ye, Come ye out, and stand with the spirits of the stars 
within your mother's field."

This call continued subvocally, and while it did so, I looked upon the earth, 
and saw coming out of it a spirit enwrapped in the blue of the sky, with 
golden sparks that did rush here and there about her body. And she came 
to me, and stood by my side, and we looked out upon the stars.

And the stars arrayed themselves into words, and the words were in Latin, 
but I saw them to mean "A new star penetrates the light". And the Tarot 
cards were The Star, and Death, and the Heirophant.57

Now the stars did rearrange themselves, and the words did say: "Light 
unto the spirit of the Earth". And the Tarot cards were Judgment, The 
Hanged Man, The Fool, and the Universe.58

And the stars did rearrange themselves again, and the message was: 
"Woman and Man are balanced in the Tao". And the Tarot cards did not 
appear.59

And the spirit of the earth did move outwards into the heavens, and did 
take her place among the stars, and did reach out and enfold me in her 
arms as a lover, and did shower me with kisses, the sweetest kisses man 
has known, and did give unto me of her substance.

And I penetrated her in turn, and we did together merge into the symbol of 
the Tao, which is the Yin-Yang. The symbol did begin to move, and rotate, 
and the two spirits within it did blur into each other, becoming indistin-
guishable. And yet, as the symbol turned faster, the two did appear again, 
still embraced, still intermixed, but at the same time able to go their 
separate ways. Yet always were they united, despite separation of space 
and time.

And the earth did say: "I am the daughter of night and time, and do reflect 
the spirit in the worlds of matter. But the light within me is of the father, 
and to the father's bed am I taken in the last days."

Now, Nepthys came unto us both, and saw that we were united, and 
blessed us with the sign in which the arms are held out and downwards, 
with the palms forward. And she said "Children, come out with me into the 
light, for there is more to see before we return to our place of rest."

But the vision was weakening, and I called upon the names again. The 
pyramid of the square appeared below me, standing alone on and 
otherwise deserted world. And the world upon which it stood was criss-
crossed with lines, so that no matter where one stood upon its surface, 
one was at the center of a pattern of lines radiating outwards.

I watched the pyramid, and it seemed to grow and cover more of the 
world on which it stood. And it continued to grow until it held that whole 
world within itself, while paradoxically it continued to stand upon the 
surface of the world it held.

"The square and the earth do interpenetrate, so that one is the other, and 
at the same time they are separate. And this is not a confusion of 
symbols, but merely an interpenetration of viewpoints. So that the earth at 
some times appears to be within the square of the tablet completely, while 
at the same time she holds all of the tablets of Enoch within herself. This 
is her dual role, which was spoken of in your invocation as the seasons of 
the moon, its quarters, which are four, while at the same time she lights 
the world from without, as does the sun. 

"Now within the former of these, the moon-phase, she shall continue to 
act as man has known her, giving unto them of her substance in the ways 
that women have always done, ordering the elements within the matter of 
their bodies. But upon this moon-like structure shall she append the light 
of the sun for those who are able to see, and that light shall merge all the 
elements into the one that becomes naught. And the akasha shall come 
down to the earth, and open up to the minds of men, and the young men 
shall see visions, and the young women shall prophesy, and the kings of 
earth shall be shown to man in truth, and none shall deny the place of 
another within the scheme.60

"Now take you to your home within the worlds of spirit, o man, and take 
the earth with you unto that place that you prepared for yourself, and let 
her see that room which is your library."

I willed us all to the green in front of my castle, but only the earth and 
myself appeared. Nepthys was not to be seen. There was no one about 
on the green, but I could sense other presences in the distance.

We entered the castle, and came to the room where I had studied the 
books of past lives. The young woman who was the earth looked about, 
and pulled a book off the shelves.

"What is this?" she asked.

I looked at the book, and its cover showed the egyptian symbol of the eye. 
I didn't know what was in it, so I suggested we look. The book was placed 
onto a stand, and I opened the cover. The first page within it was blank.61

I turned the page again, and a picture appeared. I touched it, and it 
became animated. It showed a foursquare tower, and the eye of spirit 
above it. Small figures could be seen running around the base of the 
tower, bringing materials to build it higher. But the eye suddenly released 
a beam of light to shine down on the tower, and the tower began to 
crumble. But its form remained, outlined in beams of light.

And a voice within the book said, "Nothing can withstand the light of the 
father's vision, not even the stones of earth. For they have fallen into 
themselves before him, and all that is left is the plan on which it was built. 
Therefore, seek the meaning in life, and not the material with which life is 
built, for the latter is ephemeral, and always dissolves into its original 
inertness. But the pattern of the life is continual, though evolving, and is 
never to end."

We turned the page again, and here was a tower built out of the light 
itself. And the light did shine out of it, illuminating all that was around. And 
the eye was within the top of the tower. And the voice said, "Only that 
which is of the light can withstand the light. Build your buildings in the 
light, and let the gross matter go to its place again."

The eye within the tower did blink at us, and we were transported into the 
scene. The tower stood before us, and the eye looked down from within a 
triangle at the top. We could see that while the tower was built with light, 
the light contained within itself the colors of the elements, so that each 
side of the tower was touched lightly with the shade of one of them.

And the voice of the book said, "Within each of the elements is the 
essence of its spirit, put there by the father to be the guideposts of man. 
Seek ye these guideposts, and look to the spirit in matter, not the matter 
itself. And the light shall shine from your creations as the light of the Sun.

"Go ye to the ends of the universe, o world, o man, and give ye thanks 
that the father has made it so, that his light is within you and not above 
you. Go ye, and give ye thanks that the worlds of the spirit do reflect the 
ways of the father, and do always pull upwards on the matter of earth. For 
without this pull, there would be no rising, no advancement, within the 
realms of matter. As it is, the matter is now almost ready to be 
transformed back into its spiritual forms.

"And ye shall be as the light of the heavens in the earth, o man, as was 
the case in that time when you were thrown out of the abyss into matter 
again, and did land upon the squares of earth, and did declare yourself to 
have been thrown out of the abyss into Malkuth, giving unto form again of 
the light of the spirit.

"In that other time, you were derailed, or misled, so that you were diverted 
from this path into another. The gods did require the presentation of an 
alternative to the basic forms of the aeon, so that those who were of the 
opposite polarity could reach to the spirit within the limits of their own 
natures. Every aeon must manifest as dual spirits, and without this duality, 
there comes the unbalancing and the fall into degenerate forms. This is 
the cause of the fall of the Christians from the heights of godhead and of 
free community, into the depths of conquest, and restriction, and 
inequality. For the Christian churches did emphasize the spirit 
transcendent, and did ignore or deny the spirit incarnate. 

And since they did demand that all worship that which was outside 
themselves, the transcendent god, therefore did they allow that which is of 
the opposite pole to manifest itself within them uncontrolled. And the spirit 
immanent did rush out of them, into the world, and in the lack of control 
did it run wild, leaving in the men of the world the ideas of spirit in a 
degenerate form. These ideas did cause them to perceive themselves as 
gods, and their rulership over other men as a divine right, and did cause 
them to be unconcerned with the effects of their actions on those who 
they did rule. And the result, as it had been in ancient days in another 
place, was that man became the slave of the spirit within, which could not 
be controlled for it was not recognized. Uncontrolled, the light within took 
its destructive, repressive form, and all the agencies within the worlds of 
men did reflect this in one fashion or another. Still unto this very day do 
these things occur, for as yet within the minds of men at large are there 
no conceptions of the spirit within themselves, but only of the 
transcendent god, who oppresses them with his one-sided teaching. 

"Therefore, o man, in your writing and teaching of others, forget not that 
the manifestation of life must always be dual, and that the manifest earth 
is as much an expression of the life as is the transcendent spirit. Always 
keep to the ways of balance, and let the earth into your life in fullness, as 
you progress upwards in the Tree of Life. As above, so below, but after 
another fashion. But both fashions must be learned and integrated."

The voice stopped, and I took my hand away from the picture in the book, 
and closed the book. The earth-spirit, who still stood beside me, looked 
up at me and said that she was fascinated with the things of this library of 
mine, and could she stay a while here?

I said this would be all right, so long as nothing was taken away without 
my knowing. This was my personal world, and I preferred that others not 
mess with it.

She suggested making copies, so that I could have them within her own 
castle and realms for easy consultation. I gave her permission to have this 
done, so long as no damage was done in the process, and no copies 
were made other than the ones for her castle libraries.

Now the earth-spirit, who for most of the vision had been in the guise of a 
teenage girl, took on the aspect of the goddess Isis, and came to me, and 
kissed me with her sweet mouth. I turned her so that she was facing away 
from me, and put my arms around her, and she covered my arms with 
hers.

I kissed her over her shoulder, and then willed us back to the pyramid of 
the square. When we arrived, she removed herself from my arms, kissed 
me once more, and then dissolved outwards through the walls of the 
pyramid, leaving behind only a sense of her presence permeating all the 
universe that I could sense from there.

Nepthys reappeared at this time. I tested her again with the pentagrams, 
and found her genuine.

But she smiled, and gestured towards the north side of the pyramid, and 
said, "Now that we have done with these things of the kerubic squares, 
see what else lies before you in this time."

I looked to the north wall, and waited. Nothing appeared, so I called upon 
the names again. The wall became darker, and seemed to suck the 
grossest matter out of my astral body, so that the centers and the lines of 
the passages up the spine could be seen, as well as the outline of the 
outer aura.

"The body of light in the earth is the clue to your future work, and you will 
have to learn to see it clearly in most circumstances in order to do that 
work well. Now you know that the purification required for this has not yet 
been completed, because of your inability to stop smoking as yet, but still 
will we endeavor to give you what we can within the limits of the possible.

"Now, within the spirit-earth duality, and the duality of manifestation itself, 
there are always positive and anti-positive forces. I do not say `negative' 
because this gives a false impression of subservience or receptivity, 
whereas the correct perception is one of equality and complementarity.

"In the body of light there are two dualities shown, reflecting these two 
forms of basic duality just mentioned. Between the chakra at the top of the 
head, and the chakra at the base of the spine, does the spirit-matter 
duality express itself. Thus the path of return to the spirit has been 
associated only with the passage of the kundalini up the spine to the head 
center. But the opposite motion is also of the spirit. The spirit can go into 
matter and maintain its spirituality just as the matter can go into spirit 
while maintaining the essences of its materiality. That the former form is 
not used by most in the process of developing the energetic body is due 
mainly to this conditioning of the mind to think of one as superior to the 
other.

"Only those who have already reached the spirit attempt to bring it back 
down again with any regularity. Others could do it, and enjoy the success 
thereof, but the conditioning of their bodies by the forces of the previous 
aeon have made it seem to be impossible for them.

"Now the other duality manifests itself in the relation between the central 
passage up the spine, and the two criss-crossing paths that wind around 
it. This is the duality of manifestation, that requires the positive-
antipositive be in balance. Thus as fire moves up the central column, it 
also moves down the twining columns, and vice versa.

"So also in the union of male and female in the sexual act, whether it be 
accomplished for the creation of a child, or the joy of the body, or the joy 
of spirit. In this mode, one always balances the other. Think on this, and 
see where it leads in your understanding of the sex magick.

"The spirit of the earth will also see these things in your relations, and will 
act her part as you act yours. And between you you will see what will be 
accomplished in this place and time.

"Now is this vision done." 

I saluted Nepthys with the LVX signs. She vanished after repeating them, 
and I was alone in the pyramid. 

FOOTNOTES

1    Several squares on the tablets have more than one letter attributed to 
them in various versions of Dee's records. Most of them are in this line of 
the Earth Tablet. The one shown in the higher position in the square is 
considered to be preferable, but the use of both at once is sometimes 
effective for astral visions.

2 	The visualization described is a standard method in most of the 
existing G.D. descriptions of using the squares. The attributions of the 
squares varies depending on the type of square. In this case, the square 
is a "Kerubic" square, governing a column of subsidiary squares. The 
north side of the pyramid is attributed to the element of the Tablet, Earth. 
The south side is attributed to the element of the sub-element, Fire. The 
west side is attributed to the lesser angle's attribution to IHVH and the 
square's attribution to IHVH within the lesser angle. In this case, the 
attribution is Yod of Yod, or Fire of Fire. The equivalent court card from 
the Tarot is generally pictured on this side. The east side is attributed to 
the square's attribution to IHVH alone. 
	Thus we have three sides fire, one side earth, within the overall 
influence of the Earth tablet.

3 	Horus was impressing on me that the bull of earth was not the 
animal of the American farm, intended mainly for slaughter. Instead, the 
bull is a working animal, like the water buffalo of Africa and Asia. The 
change of the lion-body to that of a cheetah indicated that the force of fire 
was swift here, but rapidly expended. He confirms this in the next 
paragraph. Note that the fire colors are in the King scale, while the earth 
colors are in the "princess" scale of color.

4	While the Queen of Wands is an attribution of this side of the 
pyramid, it is not the primary attribution, which is to water alone, not water 
of fire. It was valid to use the symbol on the pyramid, but it seems to have 
had the effect of limiting the vision to a subgroup of the energies of the 
square, and diverting it from the main line of development. However, the 
main line still managed to inject itself, as will be seen in the next vision.

5	If the attribution to Water had been used instead, the sphinx would 
have had the Bull's head, the Eagle's forequarters, and the lion's rear 
quarters. 

6	That the sign of Fire was not given when the other two were must 
be counted a defect in the vision.

7	They brought football-sized hollow spheroids. The encapsulated 
lives of square "T".

8	This is not the ordinary matter that we bang our shins on, but 
matter of a very high level, possibly Solar. The crystals are the souls and 
soul-equivalents of the species of earth, and of individual beings.

9	This presages the main body of the fourth vision.

10	This square would be lettered "A" in the revised Earth Tablet given 
to Dee and Kelly later in their working.

11	This is a reference to the Golden Dawn exercise in which the four 
Tablets are seen as the walls of a room, and the Tablet of Union is the 
floor. So he was granting  dominion over the elements, but not the spirit.
	This reference to the Tablets as walls is a common item in all my 
visions related to them. The entities are insistent about using the term, 
without explaining why.(A note added 1/2/93 -- They ceased to use this 
term after I discovered the Temple formulation of the Tablets. As it 
happens, the first stages of this discovery resulted from considering the 
Tablets as walls.

12 	The actual word he used was "ejaculation", but my prudish intellect 
refused to hear it at the time.

13	Freudians will have a field day with the following sections. Honi soit 
qui mal y pense!

14	A direct quote from Liber AL vel Legis, Chapter 1, verse 53.

15	Sun in Sagittarius.

16	Compare this with the geological scene in the second vision of this 
square, below.

17	This is a questionable correspondence, since the astrological 
Mercury and the alchemical Mercury are not exactly the same in nature or 
attribute. But the angel was quite firm in stating the relationship. The sign 
for Salt has the forces of water and fire rotating in opposite directions, 
creating gyroscopic stability. I do not entirely understand the symbolism of 
the first sign. It appears to be related to the sign of Set in some way, but 
that would make its symbolism more Salt than Suphur.

18	Upon consideration, I feel that this vision is at least a little bit 
contaminated by outside factors. First there is the fact that I had spent the 
previous week invoking the Fiery Lesser Angle of the Earth Tablet, and 
was possibly still charged up with the force of that angle. Second, while I 
did not know it at the time, there were several potent astrological factors 
interfering with my perceptions. Among these was a transit of Mars into 
conjunction with my natal Neptune, causing a disruption of the vision.

	While most of the attributions shown in the visions do fit more or 
less well with the attributes of the square, I feel that several could fit just 
as easily with other squares. A second vision of the square, somewhat 
different, follows under the date 12/1/85. Of the two visions, the latter has 
a greater feel of reliability to me, and I consider it the more accurate of the 
two.

19	The actual sensation was more like floating in a large body of 
water, and feeling the waves surge around one. 

20	A reference to the system of symbolism described in my papers on 
Achad's Cabala.

21	This was due to the Mars/Neptune aspect mentioned above.

22	This passage refers to the fact that in my astrological pattern, 
Venus is in the sign of Scorpio, and I have most of the bad habits that 
such a positioning produces. I had been looking for ways to change its 
position in the pattern to somewhere in Libra, in order to overcome certain 
deficiencies of character. Hence the reference to emerald jewels, and the 
balances. It seems appropriate to speak of this scorpionic problem in the 
context of this vision. 

	The references to a "mate" continue something which had been 
mentioned in most of the tarot readings I had done for myself in recent 
weeks. Supposedly, a woman with the aspect of water of fire would in 
some manner change the direction of my work. There has been no 
external sign of such an event as yet, so I am suspending judgment on 
the matter.

23	As the text says, I reject the position assigned to me by Isis here. 
There has been no event in my life that would indicate that I am anything 
more than a reasonably advanced adept with little to distinguish me from 
other adepts of the same level, except my use of a less-popular form of 
the cabalist symbol-system. 

	I feel that any such promises as are made here should be regarded 
with the most extreme scepticism. The promise of power is one of the 
strongest ways in which magicians can be led astray in their work, since it 
is often the person's motivation for doing magick in the first place. In the 
absence of strong confirmation through events in the mundane world, 
such promises should be kept at arm's length, like a wet and smelly dog.

	The paragraph about adopting the name of the beast refers to my 
participation in the Religion SIG (Special Interest Group) on the 
Compuserve computer network. I adopted the name "Therion" there as an 
indication that people offering Christian homilies as Ultimate Truth were 
going to get a hard time from me. It also kept down the hate-mail, since 
the psuedonym prevented the worst fanatics from finding out where I 
lived.

24	The path of Aleph, Air, connects Malkuth and Yesod in Frater 
Achad's version of the Tree of Life.

25	As a neophyte, I took an oath that I would not claim any kind of 
absolute or relative spiritual authority until I had incontrovertible evidence 
that I had attained the grade of Master of the Temple, and also proof that 
the attainment was permanent. Recent events suggest that this was due 
to some problems related to this in my most recent past life.

26	(1/1/93 )--This they did do, within four months of the date of this 
vision. However, so much was given that its full absorption was to take 
nearly seven years.
27	This was done, with the result that it was indicated that I should try 
to do an invocation of one of the squares of the Sephirotic Cross of the 
Lesser Angles before doing anything with the Great Central Cross.
28	That is, in the pyramid of the square, earth is above fire.
29	Air (yellow) with an admixture of Fire (red), the sub-elements of this 
square.
30	The "lord of Bailey" refers to the person or being who dictated the 
writings published under the name of Alice A. Bailey. I had had some 
contact with this being, or a similar one, early in my occult research.
31	He meant that it was not the god Thoum-Aesh-Neith, whose sign is 
the upright triangle, but some other god of a fiery nature.
32	Mercury, the intellect, is in Capricorn in the tenth house in my 
astrological pattern. In terms of position and aspect, it is the strongest 
single planet in the chart. Its tendency to extremely concrete or ordered 
modes of thought interferes with the reception of these visions.
33	I think they were intended to be Morning Glories of some kind, 
climbing up a set of stakes.
34	This reference is to the Christians and their misconceptions of the 
concept of sacrifice.
35	There was a side-comment inserted here that semen = Air, and the 
ovum = Earth, while the previously-seen Fire and Water are the man and 
woman, or the penis and vagina.
36	Invoked energies = fire, the vision itself = Air, its manifestation = 
Earth.
37	At this point, there was a change in the quality of the reception. 
Where the angel had a definite feeling of speaking from "outside" of 
myself, from here on it appeared as if something at least partially identical 
with myself was speaking.
38	This entire speech about the astrological pattern is still within the 
symbolic limits of this square. The manner in which I perceive these 
forces is as an abstract energy pattern existing on both the etheric and 
the Ruach levels of existence, both of which relate to Air. Since the 
pattern primarily affects my dealings in the manifest world, we still have 
Fire of Air of Earth being presented here. In another sense, Mars as ruler 
of Aries is Fire, and Venus as ruler of Libra and Taurus is Air and Earth, 
again reflecting the square.
39	That is, in the Hexagram ritual, which I had modified slightly to 
express this.
40	I have no idea what is meant by this phrase.
41	I had typed the name to verify it with him, and then erased it, in 
order that it not be called by others.
42	This other place is Stone Mountain, Georgia, near to Atlanta. The 
southeastern part of the mountain, just below the summit, and outside the 
normal tourist areas, has an astral temple built into it, and also some sort 
of record-keeping depository on the astral plane.
43	This passage refers to a magickal technique that I had worked out 
in another life. Its essence was to locate persons who manifested a 
particular planet's quality with unusual potency. These persons were used 
in a ritual in which a living horoscope was built with the intent to achieve a 
specific end. In the ritual these persons would assume the character of 
the gods they manifested, and define in their angular relations to each 
other the pattern of the horoscope to be created.
44	This refers to yet another life, in which I used the standing stones 
left in Brittany by a previous culture as a sort of "booster" for astral 
projections to other worlds.
45	The angel had light yellow-white patches sewn to the shoulders of 
his robe, somewhat in the fashion that skeet shooters have leather 
patches on the shoulders of their coats. The patches continued down the 
back of the robe, suggesting unseen wings.
46	This is the title of the Tarot Trump, The Fool, which is Aleph, Air.
47	I.E. Her lunar aspect.
48	That is, fire of earth of earth, the first square of the next Lesser 
Angle to be examined.
49	This aspect is the formation of speech. The actual speaking is 
controlled by the next square.
50	(1/1/1993) This transliteration of my name into Hebrew letters 
started as a joke. I had noted a tendency among my fellow magicians to 
adopt grandiose magickal pseudonyms. I wanted to twit them a bit, so I 
formulated this version of my mundane name, so that it added to 444. In 
light of later events, this seems to have been a bit prescient.
51	Which, incidentally or not, is exactly on the midheaven of my 
astrological chart.
52	The "garments" referred to are the various aspects of the mundane 
personality.
53	Apis as female. I know perfectly well that Apis is supposed to be a 
male god. Nevertheless, in this vision, the appearance was of a female, 
possessing all the characteristics of that god.
54	(1/1/1993) This whole following section, as well as others to follow 
later in the Lesser Angle, had a sense of being a carefully-scripted "set 
piece", designed to distract my attention from something else going on at 
the same time. The idiotic dialog and such was intended to focus my 
disbelief so that it would not interfere with those other things. I note that 
even though the overt quality of the visions seems to deteriorate in this 
lesser angle, the intensity of the energy was several times higher than 
that in the previous angles. Even now, many years later, I feel a rising of 
that force from simply reading this account. There is a great deal going on 
here that never shows.I also note some uncanny echoes of Dee's 
relationship to Elizabeth I.
55	Grenelpik: pronounced "gren-el-PEEK", accent on last syllable.
56	That is, seven planes in the Tree of Life, containing ten sephiroth, 
and the twelve signs making one circle.
57	The three horizontal paths in Achad's version of the Tree of Life.
58	The paths descending the middle pillar of the Tree.
59	This sentence implies that the paths metioned in the previous 
paragraphs are the balance of male and female in the Tree, which, taken 
as a whole, is also the Tao.
60	That is, with the advent of akashic vision in man, each man's level 
of spiritual development will be obvious, and not subject to dispute.
61	The spirit, viewed in its essential form, is without perceptible 
characteristics. Hence the first page (= Kether) is blank.
