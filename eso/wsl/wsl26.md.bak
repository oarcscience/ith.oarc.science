### CHAPTER XXIV.--The Story of Benedetto--Plotters Again Baffled.

Faithful Friend now proposed to me that we should visit one more city in
this strange land, in order that I might see the man whose fate might
have been my own but for the constancy and love which has so helped and
sustained me. Our earthly histories were in some respects different, but
there were some points of resemblance both in that and in our
dispositions which would make the sight of this man and the knowledge of
his history useful to me, while at a future time I might be able to help
him.

"It is now more than ten years," he said, "since this man passed from
earth, and it is only lately that he has begun to wish to progress. I
found him here on my former visit to this place and was able to assist
him a little and finally to enroll him as one of our Brotherhood, and I
am now told that he is shortly to leave this sphere for a higher one."

I assented to the proposed journey, and after a short but very rapid
flight we found ourselves hovering over a wide lagoon upon whose dark
bosom there floated a great city, its towers and palaces rising from the
waters, and reflected in them as in a mirror of black marble veined with
dark red lines that somehow made me feel they were streams of blood
flowing through it. Overhead there hung the same dark pall of cloud
lighted by the patches of steel grey and fiery red floating vapor which
I had noticed in the other city. The appearance of this place suggested
to me that we must be about to enter the Venice of these lower spheres,
and on my saying so to Faithful Friend he answered: "Yes, and you will
here find many celebrated men whose names were written on the history of
their times in letters of fire and blood."

We now found ourselves in the town, and proceeded to pass through its
principal canals and squares in order that I might see them.

Yes, there they were, these degraded counterparts of all those beautiful
places made familiar by the brush of the artist and the fame of those
who have carved for themselves a niche in the Temple of History. There
flowed the canals, seeming like dark crimson streams of blood flowing
from some vast shambles, washing and rippling up the marble steps of the
palaces to leave there a thick foul stain. The very stones of the
buildings and pavements seemed to me to ooze and drip blood. The air was
thick with its red shade. Deep down below the crimson waters I saw the
skeleton forms of the countless thousands who had met their deaths by
assassination or more legalized forms of murder, and whose bodies had
found sepulture beneath the dark waves. Below in the dungeons which
honeycombed the city I beheld many spirits crowded together and like
caged wild beasts--the ferocity of the cruel tiger in their gleaming
eyes and the vindictive malice of the chained human tyrant in every
attitude of their crouching figures. Spirits whom it was needful to thus
confine since they were more ferocious than savage animals. Processions
of city magistrates and their attendants, haughty nobles with their
motley following of soldiers and seamen and slaves, merchants and
priests, humble citizens and fishermen, men and women of all ranks and
all times, passed to and fro, and nearly all were alike degraded and
repulsive-looking. And as they came and went it seemed to me as if
skeleton hands, phantom arms, rose through the stones of the pavements
from the dungeons beneath, striving to draw these others down to share
their own misery. There was a haunted, hunted look on many of their
faces, and black care seemed to sit behind them continually.

Far out in the waters of the lagoon spectral galleys floated, filled
with slaves chained to their oars, but amongst them there were no longer
the helpless victims of political intrigue or private revenge. These
beings were the spirits of those who had been the hard taskmasters, the
skillful plotters who had consigned many to this living death. Yet
farther out at sea, I could behold the great ships, and nearer at hand
in the ruined harbor there were more spiritual counterparts of those
piratical craft of the Adriatic, filled with the spirits of their
piratical crews who had made plunder and rapine and war their delight,
and who now spent their time battling with one another and making forays
upon others like themselves. Spectral-looking gondolas floated upon the
water-ways of the city, filled with spirits bent upon following still
the occupations and pleasures of their former lives. In short, in this
Venice, as in the other cities I had seen, there existed a life akin to
that of earth save that from this place all the good and pure and true,
all the real patriots and unselfish citizens were gone, and only the
evil left to prey upon each other and act as avenging spirits to their
companions in crime.

Seated upon the parapet of one of the smaller bridges we found a man,
wearing the dress of the Brothers of Hope--a dark grey robe such as I
had myself worn in the earlier stages of my wanderings. His arms were
folded upon his breast and his face was so far concealed by the hood
that we could not see his features, but I knew at once that this was the
man we had come to see, and I likewise recognized his identity as that
of a celebrated Venetian painter whom I had known in my youth, though
not very intimately. We had not met again and I was ignorant that he had
passed from earth, till I saw him sitting thus upon the bridge in this
city of Hell. I confess the recognition gave me somewhat of a shock,
recalling as it did those days of my youth when I also was a student of
art with all the fairest prospects in life, as it would seem, before us,
and now to see him and to think what his life must have been to bring
him to this pass. He did not see us, so Faithful Friend proposed that we
should turn aside for a little, while he told me this spirit's history,
and then we could approach together and speak to him. It seemed that
this man (whom I shall call by his spirit name of Benedetto, since his
earthly life is better to be forgotten) had risen rapidly into fame
after I knew him, and had been fairly successful in selling his
pictures. But Italy is not now a rich country, and Benedetto's most
wealthy patrons were the English and Americans who came to visit Venice,
and at the house of one of them Benedetto met the woman who was to
overshadow his whole life with her baneful influence. He was young,
handsome, talented, highly educated, and of an ancient though poor
family, and therefore naturally received by all the best society in
Venice. It was to a lady who belonged to the higher ranks of this social
sphere that Benedetto lost his heart, and dreamed in his youthful and
romantic foolishness that she would be content to become the wife of a
struggling artist with nothing but his brains and a growing reputation.
The lady was scarce twenty when they first met, very beautiful, perfect
alike in face and form, and endowed with all the charms which can
enslave the heart of man--and she encouraged Benedetto in every way, so
that, poor youth, he believed her love to be as sincere as his. But with
all the passionate thirst of her nature for admiration and love she was
cold, calculating, ambitious, and worldly; incapable of either
understanding or returning such a love as she inspired in a nature like
Benedetto's, which knows love or hate only in extremes. She was
flattered by his attentions, charmed by his passionate devotion, and
proud of having made conquest of one so handsome and so gifted, but she
had no idea of sacrificing anything for his sake, and even when she was
most tender, most alluring to him, she was striving with all her arts to
become the wife of a middle-aged Venetian nobleman, whose wealth and
position she coveted even while she despised the man himself.

The end of Benedetto's dream came all to soon. He ventured to lay his
heart and all his prospects at the feet of his inamorata, pouring into
hear ears all the love and devotion of his soul.

"And she?"

"Well, she received it all very coolly, told him not to be a fool,
explained to him how impossible it was that she could do without money
and position, and, in fine, dismissed him with a calm indifference to
his sufferings which nearly drove him mad. He fled from Venice, went to
Paris, and there plunged into all the dissipations of that gay capital,
striving to bury the recollection of his unfortunate passion. They did
not meet for some years, and then Benedetto's fate took him back to
Venice once more, cured, as he hoped, and prepared to despise himself
for his folly. He had now become famous as a painter, and could almost
command his own price for his pictures. He found that the lady had duly
married the Marchese and was reigning as a society beauty and a queen of
fashion, surrounded by a crowd of admirers whom she did not always feel
it necessary to introduce to her husband. Benedetto had resolved to
treat the lady with cool indifference should they meet, but this was not
her intention. Once her slave, always so--no lover should dare to break
her chain till she chose to dismiss him. She devoted herself once more
to the subjugation of Benedetto's heart, and, alas! that heart was only
too ready to surrender when she told him, with every accent of feeling
in her voice, how she regretted now the path she had chosen. Thus
Benedetto became her unacknowledged lover, and for a time he lived in a
state of intoxication of happiness. But only for a time. The lady tired
of everyone after a little, she liked fresh conquests, new slaves to do
her homage. She liked excitement, and Benedetto with his jealousy, his
eternal devotion, grew tiresome, his presence wearisome. Moreover there
was another admirer, young, rich, handsome also, and the Marchesa
preferred him, and told Benedetto so, gave him, in fact, his conge for
the second time. His passionate reproaches, his violent protestations,
his vehement anger all annoyed the lady greatly; as she grew colder,
more insolent towards him, he grew more excited. He threatened, he
implored, he vowed he would shoot himself if she proved false to him,
and finally after a violent scene they parted and Benedetto went home.
When he called next day he was told by the servant that the Marchesa
declined to see him again. The insolence of a message thus given him,
the heartlessness of the Marchesa, the bitter shame of being a second
time trifled with and flung aside like an old glove, were too much for
his passionate fiery nature, and he went back to his studio and blew out
his brains.

"When his spirit awoke to consciousness it was to all the horrors of
finding himself a prisoner in his coffin in the grave. He had destroyed
his material body but he could not free his spirit from it, till the
decaying of that body should liberate the soul. Those loathsome
particles of that corrupting body still clothed the spirit, the link
between them was not severed.

"Oh, the horror of such a fate! can anyone hear of it and not shudder to
think what the bitter weariness and discontent of life, and a reckless
desire to be free of it at any cost, may plunge the soul into. If those
on earth would be truly merciful to the suicide they would cremate his
body, not bury it, that the soul may, by the speedy dispersal of the
particles, be the sooner freed from such a prison. The soul of a suicide
is not ready to leave the body, it is like an unripe fruit and does not
fall readily from the material tree which is nourishing it. A great
shock has cast it forth, but it still remains attached, till the
sustaining link shall wither away.

"From time to time Benedetto would lapse into unconsciousness and lose
for a little the sense of his terrible position, and from these states
of merciful oblivion he would awaken to find that little by little the
earthly body was losing its hold upon the spirit and crumbling into
dust, but while it did so he had to suffer in all his nerves the pangs
of this gradual dissolution. The sudden destruction of the earthly body,
while it would have given his spirit a more violent, more painful shock,
would at least have spared him the slow torture of this lingering decay.
At last the material body ceased to hold the spirit, and he rose from
the grave but still hung over it, tied, though he was no longer
imprisoned; then the last link snapped and he was free to wander forth
into the earth plane. And first his powers of hearing and seeing and
feeling were most feebly developed, then gradually they unfolded and he
became conscious of his surroundings. With these powers came again the
passions and desires of his earthly life and also the knowledge of how
he could yet gratify them. And again as in his earthly life he sought
oblivion for his sorrow and bitterness in the pleasures of the senses.
But he sought in vain. Memory was ever present with him torturing him
with the past. In his soul there was a wild hunger, a fierce thirst for
revenge, for power to make her suffer as he had done, and the very
intensity of his thoughts at last carried him to where she was. He found
her as of old, surrounded by her little court of gay admirers. A little
older but still the same, still as heartless, still untroubled by his
fate and indifferent to it. And it maddened him to think of the
sufferings he had brought upon himself for the love of this woman. At
last all thoughts became merged in the one thought of how he could find
means to drag her down from her positon, how strip her of all those
things which she prized more than love or honor or even the lives of
those who might be called her victims.

"And he succeeded, for spirits have more powers than mortals dream of.
Step by step he saw her come down from her proud position, losing first
wealth, then honor, stripped of every disguise she had worn, and known
for what she was, a vile temptress who played with men's souls as one
plays with dice, careless how many hearts she broke, how many lives she
ruined, careless alike of her husband's honor and her own fair fame, so
long as she could hide her intrigues from the eyes of the world and rise
a step higher in wealth and power upon the body of each new victim.

"And even in his darkness and misery Benedetto hugged himself and was
comforted to think it was his hands that were dragging her down and
tearing the mask from her beauty and worldliness. She wondered how it
was that so many events all tended to one end--her ruin. How it was that
her most carefully laid schemes were thwarted, her most jealously
guarded secrets found out and held up to the light of day. She began at
last to tremble at what each day might bring forth. It was as though
some unseen agency, whose toils she could not escape, was at work to
crush her, and then she thought of Benedetto and his last threats that
if she drove him to despair he would send himself to Hell and drag her
with him. She had thought he meant to murder her perhaps, and when she
heard he had shot himself and was dead, she felt relieved and soon
forgot him, save when some event would recall him to her mind for a
moment. And now she was always thinking of him, she could not get away
from the obtrusive thought, and she began to shudder with fear lest he
should rise from his grave and haunt her.

"And all the time there stood Benedetto's spirit beside her, whispering
in her ears and telling her that this was his revenge come to him at
last. He whispered to her of the past and of that love that had seemed
so sweet and that had turned to bitterest burning hate, consuming him as
with the fire of Hell whose flames should scorch her soul also and drive
her to a despair as great as his.

"And her mind felt this haunting presence even while her bodily eyes
could see nothing. In vain she fled to society, to all places where
there were crowds of men and women, in order to escape; the haunting
presence was with her everywhere. Day by day it grew more distinct, more
real, a something from which there was no escape.

"At last one evening in the dim grey of twilight she saw him, with his
wild menacing eyes, his fierce, passionate hate, expressing itself in
every line of his face, in every gesture of his form. The shock was too
much for her overwrought nerves and she fell dead upon the floor. And
then Benedetto knew that he had succeeded and had killed her, and that
from henceforth the brand of Cain was stamped upon his brow.

"Then a horror of himself seized upon him, he loathed the deed he had
done. He had intended to kill her and then when the spirit left the body
to drag it down with him and to haunt and torment it forever, so that on
neither side of the grave should she know rest. But now his only thought
was to escape from himself and the horror of his success, for all good
was not dead in this man, and the shock which had killed the Marchesa
had awakened him to the true nature of his revengeful feelings. Then he
fled from the earth, down and down even to this city of Hell, the fit
dwelling-place for such as he.

"It was in this place that I found him," said Faithful Friend, "and was
able to help the now repentant man and to show him how he might best
undo the wrong he had done. He awaits now the coming of this woman he so
loved and hated, in order that he may ask her to forgive him and that he
may forgive her himself. She has also been drawn to this sphere, for her
own life was very guilty, and it is in this counterpart of that city
which saw the history of their earthly love that they will meet again,
and that is why he awaits her upon this bridge where in the past she has
so often met him."

And will she meet him soon?"

"Yes! very soon, and then will the sojourn of this man in this sphere be
over, and he will be free to pass to a higher one, where his troubled
spirit shall at last know a season of rest ere it mounts by slow and
painful steps the stony pathway of progression."

"Will she, too, leave here with him?"

"No, oh no! she will be also helped to progress, but their paths will
lie widely asunder. There was no true affinity between them, only
passion, and pride, and wounded self-love. They will part here to meet
no more."

We now drew near Benedetto, and as I touched him on the shoulder he
started and turned round but at first did not recognize me. Then I made
myself known and said how I should rejoice to renew our early friendship
in those higher spheres in which I hoped we would both soon meet again.
I told him briefly that I, too, had sinned and suffered, and was working
my way upwards now. He seemed glad to see me and wrung my hand with much
emotion when we said good-bye, and then Faithful Friend and I went away,
leaving him still seated upon the bridge waiting for his last interview
with her who had been once so dear to him and who was now but a painful
memory.

As we were on our road from Venice to those plains which I now
understood to be the spiritual replica of the plains of Lombardy, my
attention was suddenly attracted by a voice calling to me in a pitiful
tone for help. Turning back a little way to my right hand I saw a couple
of spirits lying apparently helpless upon the ground, and one was making
gestures to cause me to come to him. So thinking it was some one in need
of my help I let my companion go on and went to see what he wanted. The
spirit holding out his hand to me and murmuring something about helping
him to rise, I bent down to lift him up, when to my surprise he made a
clutch at my legs with his hands and contrived to fasten his teeth in my
arm. While the other one, suddenly jumping up, tried to fasten upon my
throat like a wolf.

With some trouble and a good deal of anger on my part, I confess, I
shook myself free of them and was stepping back, when I half stumbled,
and turning my head saw what a great pit had suddenly opened behind me
into which with another step backwards I must have fallen.

Then I remembered the warnings given me not to allow my lower passions
to be aroused and thus place myself on a level with these beings, and I
regretted my momentary burst of anger and resolved to keep calm and
cool. I turned towards the two dark spirits again and saw that the one
who I fancied had been hurt was crawling along the ground to reach me,
while the other was gathering himself together like a wild beast about
to spring. I fixed my eyes steadily upon the pair, whom I now recognized
as the man with the withered hand and his friend, who had tried to
deceive me with the false message a short time before. Steadily I looked
at them, throwing all the power of my will into the determination that
they should not advance nearer to me. As I did so they faltered and
stopped, and finally rolled over on the ground snarling and showing
their teeth like a couple of wolves, but unable to approach a step
nearer. Leaving them thus I hurried after Faithful Friend--whom I soon
overtook--and narrated to him what had occurred.

He laughed and said, "I could have told you who those were, Franchezzo,
but I felt it would be no harm to let you find out for yourself, and
likewise learn how valuable a protection your own force of character and
determination could be. You are naturally strong willed, and so long as
you do not use it to domineer over the just rights of others it is a
most useful and valuable quality, and in your work in the spirit world
you will have found that it is the great lever by which you can act, not
alone upon those round you but even upon apparently inanimate matter,
and I thought as those two are very likely to come across you from time
to time you might as well settle now which should be master, which
should be the dominant personality. They will be shy of directly
meddling with you again, but so long as you work about the earth plane
you will find them ready at any chance to thwart your plans if the
opportunity comes."
