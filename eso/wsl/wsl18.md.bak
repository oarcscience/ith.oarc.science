### CHAPTER XVI.--Clairvoyance--The Journey Begun.

The friend whom Ahrinziman sent to accompany and instruct me, appeared
to my eyes as a youth of about five-and-twenty to thirty years of age,
judging by earth's standard in such matters, but he told me he had lived
to upwards of sixty years on earth. His present appearance was that of
his spiritual development, which alone constitutes the age of a spirit.
As a spirit grows more highly developed in his intellectual powers, the
appearance becomes more matured, till at last he assumes that of a sage,
without, however, the wrinkles and defects of age in earth life, only
its dignity, its power, and its experience. Thus, when a spirit has
attained to the highest possible development of the earth (or any other
planet's) spheres he would possess the appearance of one of its
patriarchs, and would then pass into the higher and more extended
spheres of the solar system of that planet, beginning there as a youth
again since his development compared to that of the advanced spirits of
those higher spheres would be but that of a youth.

Hassein told me that he was at present studying the various powers and
forms of nature in those stages which were below soul life, and would be
able to make visible and explain to me many curious things we should see
upon our journey.

"Many spirits," he said, "pass through the sphere of the astral plane
without being conscious of its spectral inhabitants, by reason of the
fact that their senses are not developed in such a way as to enable them
to become conscious of their surroundings in all their entirety, just as
in earth life there are many persons quite unable to see the spirits
around them, although to others again they are perfectly visible. There
are upon earth persons who can see not alone the spirits of human beings
but also these astral and elementary beings who are not truly 'spirits,'
since that word should be used to denote only those which possess within
them the soul germ. Now many of these beings which we shall see never
possessed any soul, and others again are only the empty shells from
which the soul germ has departed. To distinguish between the soul spirit
and the soulless astral one must possess a double power of soul-sight or
clairvoyance as it is termed, and many who possess only an imperfect
degree of this double power will be able to see elementals and astrals,
but without being able to distinguish them clearly from the
soul-enveloping spirit forms. Hence much confusion and many mistakes
have arisen amongst these imperfect clairvoyants as to the nature and
attributes of these classes of beings. There are seven degrees of the
soul-sight found in persons yet in the earth life; and in the next stage
of life the spiritual part or soul being freed from the gross elements
of material life, there will be found seven more expansions of this
gift, and so on in progressive succession as the soul casts off one by
one the envelopes of matter--first the most gross or earthly matter,
then succeeding degrees of refined or sublimated matter, for we hold
that there can be no such thing as entire severance between soul and
matter--that is so long as it is conscious of existence in any of our
solar systems. Beyond these limits we have no knowledge to guide us, and
it is a matter of pure speculation. It is only a question of the degree
and quality of the matter which is more or less refined and etherealized
as the soul is in a higher or lower state of development. It is of the
first stage of earthly conscious soul life that I shall now speak in
speaking of the clairvoyant sight, leaving till another time the
theories and beliefs involved in the study of what has passed before
man's present conscious stage of existence and what may happen when he
passes beyond the limits of our present knowledge.

"We find, then, in the earthly stage of life persons--most often women
or very young boys--who are endowed with some or all of these seven
degrees of soul-sight. The first three degrees are very often found, the
fourth and fifth more rarely, while the sixth and seventh are hardly
ever met with except in persons endowed with certain peculiarities of
organization, due to those astrological influences under which they are
born--particularly to those prevailing at the exact moment the child
sees the light of earth life. So rare are these perfect sixth and
seventh degrees that very few possess them, though some are found with
an imperfect sixth and none of the seventh, in which case they can never
attain to the perfection of soul-sight, and as with imperfect glasses,
the defect in their sight will cause them to have an imperfect vision of
celestial things, and although they will see into the sixth sphere in a
sense, yet their defective power will greatly impair the value of what
they see.

"Those, however, who have the perfect sixth and seventh degrees can be
taken in spirit into the seventh sphere itself, which is the highest, or
heaven of the earth spheres, and like St. John of old they shall see
unspeakable things. To do this the soul requires to be freed from all
ties to the material body, save only the slender thread without which
connecting link, body and soul would part forever. Thus they may be said
to be out of the body at such times, and so difficult and dangerous is
it to thus take the soul into the seventh sphere, that only with
exceptional persons and under very exceptional circumstances can it be
done even where the power exists. Of the clairvoyants of the lower
degrees of power the same may be said, except that the less celestial
their powers, the more safely and easily may they be used, each
clairvoyant being able to see into that sphere which corresponds to the
degree of power which they possess. It is, however, a curious fact that
many clairvoyants possess one or more perfect degrees of soul-sight with
at the same time an imperfect form of a degree still higher, and when
this is so it will be found that the medium mixes the visions seen and
is not reliable, since the defective degree (if used) will act like a
defective eye and cause that which is beheld by both eyes at the same
time to partake of its imperfections. It is, therefore, far better to
have the entire absence of a degree than to possess an imperfect form of
it, since the imperfect one only causes confusion in using the perfect
ones, unless indeed you do with these powers as you might do with the
defective eye, and close it altogether in order that the vision, though
limited, may be correct. Thus the ancients when they found the highest
amount of perfect vision of one or more degrees in their pupils,
arrested their further development at that degree before the imperfect
sight of a higher one could in any way impair the value of those they
possessed. In this way they were able to train as reliable clairvoyants
of moderate powers many who by a further effort at development would
have lost far more than they could gain. In olden days seers were
divided into classes even as they still are amongst certain schools of
prophets in the East, though now the art is not studied to the
perfection it once was when the Eastern nations were a power upon earth.

"Each class underwent a special training adapted to their special
degrees of power and class of gifts, and there was not the present
curious mixture of great gifts and entire ignorance of how to use them
wisely, which in many instances results in so many inaccuracies and so
much harm both to mediums and to those who go to them for spiritual
knowledge. As well might a trainer of young gymnasts think that he could
overtax and strain the growing muscles without lasting harm to them, as
those who make an ignorant, unlimited, and indiscriminate use and
development of the mediumistic powers. A young fledgling cast from the
nest too soon flutters and falls to the ground, while if left till the
wings are strong enough to bear its flight it will soar to heaven
itself. With more extended knowledge upon earth there will be given to
certain sensitives endowed with the needful mediumistic powers the
knowledge by which under the guidance of those higher intelligences who
are directing the great spiritual movement, they can judge between the
spirits of low and degraded states and those of a higher degree of
advancement, and thus much of the confusion and danger which still
hampers the movement will be gradually eliminated from it.

"On the spirit side of life are many teachers who for centuries have
made a study of these subjects--of all forms of life--and of the
mediumistic powers of those who are incarnated upon earth, and they are
even now seeking on all sides for open doors through which to impart
such knowledge as may be of use to man. Much which they know could not
yet be imparted, but there are things which could, and with this subject
as with all others the minds upon earth will expand and develop as
knowledge is given."

I thanked my new friend for his information and promised help, and as
the expedition was soon to start I went to earth to bid adieu for a time
to my beloved. Upon our parting I shall not dwell, nor say how much we
both felt we should miss our constant little intercourse; for even
restricted as it was by the barrier between us, it had been been a great
joy to both.

I found on my return that the preparations for our journey were now
complete, and I was summoned to bid my father and others adieu, and to
join my companions in the great hall where they were now assembled to
receive the farewell benediction of our Grand Master.

After this our band started amidst the cheers and good wishes of all the
assembled Brotherhood.
