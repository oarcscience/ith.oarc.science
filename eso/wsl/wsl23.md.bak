### CHAPTER XXI.--The Fires of Hell--A Vengeful Spirit--Pirates--The Sea of Foul Mud--The Mountains of Selfish Oppression--The Forest of Desolation--Messages of Love.

Away before me stretched a narrow path, and curious to see where it
would lead I followed it, sure that it would somehow lead me to those
whom I could help. After following it for a short time I came to the
foot of a range of black mountains, and before me was the entrance to a
huge cavern. Horrible reptiles were hanging on to the walls and crawling
at my feet. Great funguses and monstrous air plants of an oozy slimy
kind hung in festoons like ragged shrouds from the roof, and a dark pool
of stagnant water almost covered the floor. I thought of turning away
from this spot, but a voice seemed to bid me go on, so I entered, and
skirting round the edge of the dark pool found myself at the entrance to
a small dark passage in the rocks. Down this I went, and turning a
corner saw before me a red light as from a fire, while dark forms like
goblins passed and repassed between it and myself. Another moment and I
stood at the end of the passage. Before me was a gigantic dungeon-like
vault, its uneven rocky roof half revealed and half hidden by the masses
of lurid smoke and flames which arose from an enormous fire blazing in
the middle of the cavern, while round it were dancing such a troop of
demons as might well typify the Devils of Hell. With shrieks and yells
of laughter they were prodding at the fire with long black spears and
dancing and flinging themselves about in the wildest fashion, while in a
corner were huddled together a dozen or so of miserable dark spirits
towards whom they made frantic rushes from time to time as if about to
seize and hurl them into the fire, always retreating again with yells
and howls of rage.

I soon perceived that I was invisible to these beings, so taking courage
from that fact, I drew nearer. To my horror I discovered that the fire
was composed of the bodies of living men and women who writhed and
twisted in the flames, and were tossed about by the spears of those
awful demons. I was so appalled by this discovery that I cried out to
know if this was a real scene or only some horrible illusion of this
dreadful place, and the same deep mysterious voice that had often spoken
to me in my wanderings answered me now.

"Son! they are living souls who in their earthly lives doomed hundreds
of their fellow men to die this dreadful death, and knew no pity, no
remorse, in doing so. Their own cruelties have kindled these fierce
flames of passion and hate in the breast of their many victims, and in
the spirit world these fiery germs have grown till they are now a fierce
flame to consume the oppressors. These fires are fed solely by the
fierce cruelties of those they now consume; there is not here one pang
of anguish which has not been suffered a hundred fold more in the
persons of these spirits' many helpless victims. From this fire these
spirits will come forth touched by a pity, born of their own sufferings,
for those they wronged in the past, and then will be extended to them
the hand of help and the means of progression through deeds of mercy as
many and as great as have been their merciless deeds in the past. Do not
shudder nor marvel that such retribution as this is allowed to be. The
souls of these spirits were so hard, so cruel, that only sufferings felt
by themselves could make them pity others. Even since they left the
earth life they have only been intent upon making others more helpless
suffer, till the bitter hatred they have aroused has become at last a
torrent which has engulfed themselves. Furthermore, know that these
flames are not truly material, although to your eyes and to theirs they
appear so, for in the spirit world that which is mental is likewise
objective, and fierce hatred or burning passion does indeed seem a
living fire. You shall now follow one of these spirits and see for
yourself that what seems to you cruel justice is yet mercy in disguise.
Behold these passions are burning themselves out and the souls are about
to pass into the darkness of the plain beyond."

As the voice ceased the flames died down and all was darkness save for a
faint bluish light like phosphorus that filled the cavern, and by it I
saw the forms of the spirits rise from the ashes of the fire and pass
out of the cavern. As I followed them one became separated from the
others and passing on before me went into the streets of a city that was
near. It seemed to me like one of the old Spanish cities of the West
Indies or South America. There were Indians passing along its streets
and mingling with Spaniards and men of several other nations.

Following the spirit through several streets we came to a large building
which seemed to be a monastery of the order of Jesuits--who had helped
to colonize the country and force upon the unhappy natives the Roman
Catholic religion, in the days when religious persecution was thought by
most creeds to be a proof of religious zeal; and then, while I stood
watching this spirit, I saw pass before me a panorama of his life.

I saw him first chief of his order, sitting as a judge before whom were
brought many poor Indians and heretics, and I saw him condemning them by
hundreds to torture and flames because they would not become converts to
his teachings. I saw him oppressing all who were not powerful enough to
resist him, and extorting jewels and gold in enormous quantities as
tribute to him and to his order; and if any sought to resist him and his
demands he had them arrested and almost without even the pretense of a
trial thrown into dungeons and tortured and burned. I read in his heart
a perfect thirst for wealth and power and an actual love for beholding
the sufferings of his victims, and I knew (reading as I seemed to do his
innermost soul) that his religion was but a cloak, a convenient name,
under which to extort the gold he loved and gratify his love of power.

Again I saw the great square or market place of this city with hundreds
of great fires blazing all round it till it was like a furnace, and a
whole helpless crowd of timid gentle natives were bound hand and foot
and thrown into the flames, and their cries of agony went up to Heaven
as this cruel man and his vile accomplices chanted their false prayers
and held aloft the sacred cross which was desecrated by their unholy
hands, their horrible lives of cruelty and vice, and their greed for
gold. I saw that this horror was perpetrated in the name of the Church
of Christ--of him whose teachings were of love and charity, who came to
teach that God was perfect Love. And I saw this man who called himself
Christ's minister, and yet had no thought of pity for one of these
unhappy victims; he thought alone of how the spectacle would strike
terror to the hearts of other Indian tribes, and make them bring him
more gold to satisfy his greedy lust. Then I beheld this man returned to
his own land of Spain and revelling in his ill-gotten wealth, a powerful
wealthy prince of the church, venerated by the poor ignorant populace as
a holy man who had gone forth into that Western World beyond the seas to
plant the banner of his church and preach the blessed gospel of love and
peace, while, instead, his path had been marked in fire and blood, and
then my sympathy for him was gone. Then I saw this man upon his
deathbed, and I saw monks and priests chanting mass for his soul that it
might go to Heaven, and instead I saw it drawn down and down to Hell by
the chains woven in his wicked life. I saw the great hordes of his
former victims awaiting him there, drawn down in their turn by their
thirst for revenge, their hunger for power to avenge their sufferings
and the sufferings of those most dear to them.

I saw this man in Hell surrounded by those he had wronged, and haunted
by the empty wraiths of such as were too good and pure to come to this
place of horror or to wish for vengeance on their murderer, just as I
had seen in the Frozen Land with the man in the icy cage; and in Hell
the only thought of that spirit was rage because his power on earth was
no more--his only idea how he might join with others in Hell as cruel as
himself and thus still oppress and torture. If he could have doomed his
victims to death a second time he would have done it. In his heart there
was neither pity nor remorse, only anger that he was so powerless. Had
he possessed one feeling of sorrow or one thought of kindness for
another, it would have helped him and created a wall between himself and
these vengeful spirits, and his sufferings, though they might be great,
would not have at last assumed the physical aspect in which I had beheld
them. As it was, his passion of cruelty was so great it fed and fanned
into fresh life the spiritual flames which theirs created, till at last
when I saw him first they were dying out exhausted by their own
violence. Those demons I had beheld were the last and most fierce of his
victims in whom the desire for revenge was even then not fully
satisfied, while those I had beheld crouching in the corner were some
who, no longer desirous of tormenting him themselves, had yet been
unable to withdraw themselves from beholding his sufferings and those of
his accomplices.

And now I beheld that spirit with the newly awakened thought of
repentence, returning to the city to warn others of his Jesuit
fraternity, and to try to turn them from the path of his own errors. He
did not yet realize the length of time that had elapsed since he had
left the earth life, nor that this city was the spiritual counterpart of
the one he had lived in on earth. In time, I was told, he would be sent
back to earth to work as a spirit in helping to teach mortals the pity
and mercy he had not shown in his own life, but first he would have to
work here in this dark place, striving to release the souls of those
whom his crimes had dragged down with him. Thus I left this man at the
door of that building which was the counterpart of his earthly house,
and passed on by myself through the city.

Like the Roman city this one was disfigured and its beauties blotted out
by the crimes of which it had been the silent witness; and to me the air
seemed full of dark phantom forms wailing and weeping and dragging after
them their heavy chains. The whole place seemed built upon living graves
and shrouded in a dark red mist of blood and tears. It was like one vast
prison house whose walls were built of deeds of violence and robbery and
oppression.

And as I wandered on I had a waking dream, and saw the city as it had
been on earth ere the white man had set his foot upon its soil. I saw a
peaceful primitive people living upon fruits and grains and leading
their simple lives in an innocence akin to that of childhood, worshiping
the Great Supreme under a name of their own, yet none the less
worshiping him in spirit and in truth--their simple faith and their
patient virtues the outcome of the inspiration given them from that
Great Spirit who is universal and belongs to no creeds, no churches.
Then I saw white men come thirsting for gold and greedy to grasp the
goods of others, and these simple people welcomed them like brothers,
and in their innocence showed them the treasures they had gathered from
the earth--gold and silver and jewels. Then I saw the treachery which
marked the path of the white man; how they plundered and killed the
simple natives; how they tortured and made slaves of them, forcing them
to labor in the mines till they died by thousands; how all faith, all
promises, were broken by the white man till the peaceful happy country
was filled with tears and blood.

Then I beheld afar, away in Spain, a few good, true, kindly men whose
souls were pure and who believed that they alone had the true faith by
which only man can be saved and live eternally, who thought that God had
given this light to but one small spot of his earth, and had left all
the rest in darkness and error--had left countless thousands to perish
because this light had been denied to them but given exclusively to that
one small spot of earth, that small section of his people.

I thought that these good and pure men were so sorry for those who, they
thought, were in the darkness and error of a false religion, that they
set forth and crossed that unknown ocean to that strange far-away land
to carry with them their system of religion, and to give it to those
poor simple people whose lives had been so good and gentle and spiritual
under their own faith, their own beliefs.

I saw these good but ignorant priests land on this strange shore and
beheld them working everywhere amongst the natives, spreading their own
belief and crushing out and destroying all traces of a primitive faith
as worthy of respect as their own. These priests were kind good men who
sought to alleviate the physical lot of the poor oppressed natives even
while they labored for their spiritual welfare also, and on every side
there sprang up missions, churches and schools.

Then I beheld great numbers of men, priests as well as many others, come
over from Spain, eager, not for the good of the church nor to spread the
truths of their religion, but only greedy for the gold of this new land,
and for all that could minister to their own gratification; men whose
lives had disgraced them in their own country till they were obliged to
fly to this strange one to escape the consequences of their misdeeds. I
saw these men arrive in hordes and mingle with those whose motives were
pure and good, till they had outnumbered them, and then thrust the good
aside everywhere, and made of themselves tyrannical masters over the
unhappy natives, in the name of the Holy Church of Christ.

And then I saw the Inquisition brought to the unhappy land and
established as the last link in the chain of slavery and oppression thus
riveted round this unhappy people, till it swept almost all of them from
the face of the earth; and everywhere I beheld the wild thirst, the
greed for gold that consumed as with a fire of hell all who sought that
land. Blind were most of them to all its beauties but its gold, deaf to
all thought but how they might enrich themselves with it; and in the
madness of that time and that awful craving for wealth was this city of
Hell, this spiritual counterpart of the earthly city built, stone upon
stone, particle by particle, forming between itself and the city of
earth chains of attraction which should draw down one by one each of its
wicked inhabitants, for truly the earthly lives are building for each
man and woman their spiritual habitations. Thus all these monks and
priests, all these fine ladies, all these soldiers and merchants, yea,
and even these unhappy natives had been drawn down to Hell by the deeds
of their earthly lives, by the passions and hatreds, the greed of gold,
the bitter sense of wrongs unrequited and the thirst for revenge which
those deeds had created.

At the door of a large square building, whose small grated windows
looked like a prison, I stopped, arrested by the cries and shouts which
came from it; then guided by the mysterious voice of my unseen guide I
entered, and following the sounds soon came to a dungeon cell. Here I
found a great number of spirits surrounding a man who was chained to the
wall by an iron girdle round his waist. His wild glaring eyes,
disheveled hair and tattered clothing suggested that he had been there
for many years, while the hollow sunken cheeks and the bones sticking
through his skin told that he was to all appearance dying of starvation;
yet I knew that here there was no death, no such relief from suffering.
Near him stood another man with folded arms and bowed head, whose wasted
features and skeleton form scarred with many wounds made him an even
more pitiable object than the other, though he was free while the other
was chained to the wall. Around them both danced and yelled other
spirits, all wild and savage and degraded. Some of them were Indians, a
few Spanish, and one or two looked, I thought, like Englishmen. All were
at the same work--throwing sharp knives at the chained man that never
seemed to hit him, shaking their fists in his face, cursing and reviling
him, yet, strange to say, never able to actually touch him, and all the
time there he stood chained to the wall, unable to move or get away from
them. And there stood the other man silently watching him.

As I stood looking at this scene I became conscious of the past history
of those two men. I saw the one who was chained to the wall in a
handsome house like a palace, and knew he had been one of the judges
sent out from Spain to preside over the so-called courts of justice,
which had but proved additional means for extorting money from the
natives and oppressing all who sought to interfere with the rich and
powerful. I saw the other man who had been a merchant, living in a
pretty villa with a beautiful, a very beautiful, wife and one little
child. This woman had attracted the notice of the judge, who conceived
an unholy passion for her, and on her persistently repulsing all his
advances he made an excuse to have the husband arrested on suspicion by
the Inquisition and thrown into prison. Then he carried off the poor
wife and so insulted her that she died, and the poor little child was
strangled by order of the cruel judge.

Meantime the unfortunate husband lay in prison, ignorant of the fate of
his wife and child and of the charge under which he had been arrested,
growing more and more exhausted from the scanty food and the horrors of
the dungeon, and more and more desperate from the suspense. At last he
was brought before the council of the Inquisition, charged with
heretical practices and conspiracy against the crown, and on denial of
these charges was tortured to make him confess and give up the names of
certain of his friends who were accused of being his accomplices. As the
poor man, bewildered and indignant, still protested his innocence he was
sent back to his dungeon and there slowly starved to death, the cruel
judge not daring to set him at liberty, well knowing that he would make
the city ring with the story of his wrongs and his wife's fate when he
should learn it.

As so this poor man had died, but he did not join his wife, who, poor
injured soul, had passed at once with her little innocent child into the
higher spheres. She was so good and pure and gentle that she had even
forgiven her murderer--for such he was, though he had not intended to
kill her--and between her and the husband she so dearly loved there was
a wall created by his bitter revengeful feelings against the man who had
destroyed them both.

When this poor wronged husband died, his soul could not leave the earth.
It was tied there by his hatred of his enemy and his thirst for revenge.
His own wrongs he might have forgiven, but the fate of his wife and
child had been too dreadful. He could not forgive that. Before even his
love for his wife came this hate, and day and night his spirit clung
fast to the judge, seeking for the chance of vengeance; and at last it
came. Devils from Hell--such as had once tempted me--clustered round the
wronged spirit and taught it how through the hand of a mortal it could
strike the assassin's dagger to the judge's heart, and then when death
severed the body and the spirit he could drag that down with him to
Hell. So terrible had been this craving for revenge, nursed through the
waiting years of solitude in prison and in the spirit land, that the
poor wife had tried and tried in vain to draw near her husband and
soften his heart with better thoughts. Her gentle soul was shut out by
the wall of evil drawn round the unhappy man, and he also had no hope of
ever seeing her again. He deemed that she had gone to Heaven and was
lost to him for evermore. A Roman Catholic of the narrow views held
nearly two hundred years ago when this man had lived, he believed that
being under the ban of its priests and denied the ministrations of the
church when he died, was the reason he was one of the eternally lost,
while his wife and child must be with the angels of Heaven. Is it
wonderful, then, that all this poor spirit's thoughts should center in
the desire for vengeance, and that he should plan only how to make his
enemy suffer as he had been made to suffer? Thus, then, it was he who
inspired a man on earth to kill the judge; his hand guided the mortal's
with so unerring an aim that the judge fell pierced to his false, cruel
heart. The earthly body died but the immortal soul lived, and awakened
to find itself in Hell, chained to a dungeon wall as he had chained his
victim, and face to face with him at last.

There were others whom the judge had wronged and sent to a death of
suffering to gratify his anger or to enrich himself at their expense,
and these all gathered round him and made his awakening a Hell indeed.
Yet such was the indomitable strength of will of this man that none of
the blows aimed at him could touch him, none of the missiles strike, and
thus through all the years had those two deadly enemies faced each
other, pouring out their hatred and defiance while those other spirits,
like the chorus of a Greek tragedy, came and went and amused themselves
devising fresh means to torment the chained man whose strong will kept
them at bay.

And away in the bright spheres mourned the poor wife, striving and
hoping till the time should come when her influence would be felt even
in this awful place, when her love and her unceasing prayers should
reach the soul of her husband and soften it, that he might relent in his
bitter purpose and turn from his revenge. It was her prayers which had
drawn me to this dungeon, and it was her soul which spoke to mine,
telling me all the sad cruel story, and pleading with me to carry to her
unhappy husband the knowledge that she lived only in thoughts of him,
only in the hope that he would be drawn by her love to the upper spheres
to join her in peace and happiness at last. With this vision strong upon
me, I drew near the sullen man who was growing tired of his revenge, and
whose heart was full of longing for the wife he loved so passionately.

I touched him upon the shoulder and said: "Friend, I know why you are
here, and all the cruel story of your wrongs, and I am sent from her you
love to tell you that in the bright land above she awaits you, wearying
that you do not come and marveling that you can find revenge more sweet
than her caresses. She bids me tell you that you chain yourself here
when you might be free."

The spirit started as I spoke, then turning to me grasped my arm and
gazed long and ernestly into my face as though to read there whether I
spoke truly or falsely. Then he sighed as he drew back, saying: "Who are
you and why do you come here? You are like none of those who belong to
this awful place, and your words are words of hope, yet how can there be
hope for the soul in Hell?"

"There is hope even here; for hope is eternal and God in his mercy shuts
none out from it, whatever man in his earth-distorted image of the
divine teachings may do. I am sent to give hope to you and to others who
are, like you, in sorrow for the past, and if you will but come with me,
I can show you how to reach the Better Land."

I saw that he hesitated, and a bitter struggle went on in his heart, for
he knew that it was his presence which kept his enemy a prisoner, that
were he to go the other would be free to wander through this Dark Land,
and even yet he could hardly let him go. Then I spoke again of his wife;
his child; would he not rather go to them? The strong passionate man
broke down as he thought of those loved ones, and burying his face in
his hands wept bitter tears. I put my arm through his and led him,
unresisting, out of the prison and out of the city. Here we found kind
spirit friends were awaiting the poor man, and with them I left him that
they might bear him to a bright land where he would see his wife from
time to time, till he worked himself up to the level of her sphere,
where they would be united forever in a happiness more perfect than
could ever have been their lot on earth.

I did not return to the city, for I felt my work there was done, and so
wandered on in search of fresh fields of usefulness. In the middle of a
dark lonely plain I came upon a solitary hut, in which I found a man
lying on some wisps of dirty straw, unable to move and to all appearance
dying.

He told me that in his earth life he had thus abandoned and left to die
a sick comrade, whom he had robbed of the gold for which they had both
risked their lives, and that now he also was dead he found himself lying
in the same helpless deserted way.

I asked him if he would not wish to get up and go and do something to
help others and thus atone for the murder of his friend, because if so I
thought I could help him.

He thought he would like to get up certainly. He was sick of this hole,
but he did not see why he should work at anything or bother about other
people. He would rather look for the money he had buried, and spend
that. Here his cunning eyes glanced furtively at me to see what I
thought of his money and if I was likely to try to find it.

I suggested to him that he ought rather to think of trying to find the
friend he had murdered and make reparation to him. But he wouldn't hear
of that, and got quite angry, said he was not sorry he had killed his
friend, and only sorry he was here. He thought I would have helped him
to get away. I tried to talk to this man and make him see how he really
might better his position and undo the wrong he had done, but it was no
use, his only idea was that once given the use of his limbs again he
could go and rob or kill some one else. So at last I left him where he
lay, and as I went out his feeble hand picked up a stone and flung it
after me.

"What," I asked mentally, "will become of this man?"

I was answered: "He has just come from earth after dying a violent
death, and his spirit is weak, but ere long he will grow strong, and
then he will go forth and join other marauders like himself who go about
in bands, and add another horror to this place. After the lapse of many
years--it may even be centuries--the desire for better things will
awake, and he will begin to progress, but very slowly, for the soul
which has been in chains so long and is so poorly developed, so degraded
as in this man, often takes cycles of time to develop its dormant
powers."

After I had wandered for some time over this dreary desolate plain I
felt so tired, weary of heart, that I sat down, and began musing upon
what I had seen in this awful sphere. The sight of so much evil and
suffering had depressed me, the awful darkness and heavy murky clouds
oppressed my soul that ever had loved the sunshine and the light as I
fancy only we of the Southern nations love it. And then I wearied. Ah!
how I wearied and longed for news from her whom I had left on earth. No
word had reached me as yet from my friends--no news of my beloved. I
knew not how long I had been in this place where there was no day to
mark the time, nothing but eternal night that brooded and reigned in
silence over everything. My thoughts were full of my beloved, and I
prayed earnestly, that she might be kept safe on earth to gladden my
eyes when the time of probation in this place should be over. While I
prayed I became conscious of a soft pale light suffused around me, as
from a glowing star, that grew and grew till it expanded and opened out
into a most glorious picture framed in rays of light, and in the centre
I saw my darling, her eyes looking into mine and smiling at me, her
sweet lips parted as though speaking my name; then she seemed to raise
her hand and touching her lips with her finger tips, threw me a kiss. So
shyly, so prettily, was it done that I was in raptures, and rose to
return her that kiss, to look more closely at her, and lo! the vision
had vanished and I was alone on the dark plain once more. But no longer
sad, that bright vision had cheered me, and given me hope and courage to
go on once more and bring to others such hope as cheered myself.

I arose and went on again, and in a short time was overtaken by a number
of dark and most repulsive-looking spirits; they wore ragged black
cloaks and seemed to have their faces concealed by black masks like
spectral highwaymen. They did not see me, and I had found that as a rule
the dwellers of this sphere were too low in intelligence and spiritual
sight to be able to see anyone from the spheres above unless brought
into direct contact with them. Curious to see what they were about, I
drew back and followed them at a little distance. Presently another
party of dark spirits approached, carrying what looked like bags with
some sort of treasure. Immediately they were attacked by the
first-comers. They had no weapons in their hands, but they fought like
wild beasts with teeth and claws, their finger nails being like the
claws of a wild animal or a vulture. They fastened upon each other's
throats and tore them. They scratched and bit like tigers or wolves,
till one-half at least were left lying helpless upon the ground, while
the rest rushed off with the treasure (which to me seemed only lumps of
hard stone).

When all who were able to move had gone, I drew near the poor spirits
lying moaning on the ground to see if I could help any of them. But it
seemed to be no use doing so; they only tried to turn upon me and tear
me in pieces. They were more like savage beasts than men, even their
bodies were bent like a beast's, the arms long like an ape's, the hands
hard, and the fingers and nails like claws, and they half walked and
half crawled on all-fours. The faces could scarcely be called human; the
very features had become bestial, while they lay snarling and showing
their teeth like wolves. I thought of the strange wild tales I had read
of men changing into animals, and I felt I could almost have believed
these were such creatures. In their horrible glaring eyes there was an
expression of calculation and cunning which was certainly human, and the
motions of their hands were not like those of an animal; moreover they
had speech and were mingling their howls and groans with oaths and
curses and foul language unknown to animals.

"Are there souls even here?" I asked.

Again came the answer: "Yes, even here. Lost, degraded, dragged down and
smothered, till almost all trace is lost, yet even here there are the
germs of souls. These men were pirates of the Spanish main, highwaymen,
freebooters, slave dealers, and kidnappers of men. They have so
brutalized themselves that almost all trace of the human is merged in
the wild animal. Their instincts were those of savage beasts; now they
live like beasts and fight like them."

"And for them is there still hope, and can anyone help them?" I asked.

"Even for these there is hope, though many will not avail themselves of
it for ages yet to come. Yet here and there are others who even now can
be helped."

I turned, and at my feet lay a man who had dragged himself to me with
great difficulty and was now too exhausted for further effort. He was
less horrible to look upon than the others, and in his distorted face
there were yet traces of better things. I bent over him and heard his
lips murmur: "Water! Water for any sake! Give me water for I am consumed
with a living fire."

I had no water to give him and knew not where to get any in this land,
but I gave him a few drops of the essence I had brought from the Land of
Dawn for myself. The effect upon him was like magic. It was an elixir.
He sat up and stared at me and said:

"You must be a magician. That has cooled me and put out the fire that
has burned within me for years. I have been filled with a living fire of
thirst ever since I came to this Hell."

I had now drawn him away from the others, and began to make passes over
his body, and as I did so his sufferings ceased and he grew quiet and
restful. I was standing by him wondering what to do next, whether to
speak or to go away and leave him to himself, when he caught my hand and
kissed it passionately.

"Oh! friend, how am I to thank you? What shall I call you who have come
to give me relief after all these years of suffering?"

"If you are thus grateful to me, would you not wish to earn the
gratitude of others by helping them? Shall I show you how you could?"

"Yes! Oh! yes, most gladly, if only you will take me with you, good
friend."

"Well, then, let me help you up, and if you are able we had bettr leave
this spot as soon as we can," said I, and together we set forth to see
what we could do.

My companion told me he had been a pirate and in the slave trade. He had
been mate of a ship and was killed in a fight, and had awakened to find
himself and others of the crew in this dark place. How long he had been
there he had no idea, but it seemed like eternity. He and other spirits
like him went about in bands and were always fighting. When they did not
meet another party to fight they fought amongst themselves; the thirst
for fighting was the only excitement they could get in this horrible
place where there was never any drink to be got which could quench the
awful burning thirst which consumed them all; what they drank only
seemed to make them a thousand times worse, and was like pouring living
fire down their throats. Then he said: "You never could die, no matter
what you suffered, that was the awful curse of the thing, you had got
beyond death, and it was no use trying to kill yourself or get others to
kill you, there was no such escape from suffering.

"We are like a lot of hungry wolves," he said, "for want of anyone to
attack us we used to fall upon each other and fight till we were
exhausted, and then we would lie moaning and suffering till we recovered
enough to go forth again and attack someone else. I have been longing
for any means of escape. I have almost got to praying for it at last. I
felt I would do anything if God would only forgive me and let me have
another chance; and when I saw you standing near me I thought perhaps
you were an angel sent down to me after all. Only you've got no wings
nor anything of that sort, as they paint 'em in pictures. But then
pictures don't give you much idea of this place, and if they are wrong
about one place why not about the other?"

I laughed at him; yes, even in that place of sorrow I laughed, my heart
felt so much lightened to find myself of so much use. And then I told
him who I was and how I came to be there, and he said if I wanted to
help people there were some dismal swamps near where a great many
unhappy spirits were imprisoned, and he could take me to them and help a
bit himself he thought. He seemed afraid to let me go out of his sight
lest I should disappear and leave him alone again. I felt quite
attracted to this man because he seemed so very grateful and I was also
glad of companionship of any sort (except that of those most repulsive
beings who seemed the majority of the dwellers here) for I felt lonely
and somewhat desolate in this far-off dismal country.

The intense darkness, the horrible atmosphere of thick fog, made it
almost impossible to see far in any direction, so that we reached the
land of swamps before I was aware of it except for feeling a cold, damp,
offensive air which blew in our faces. Then I saw looming before me a
great sea of liquid mud, black, fetid and stagnant, a thick slime of
oily blackness floating on the top. Here and there monstrous reptiles,
with huge inflated bodies and projecting eyes were wallowing. Great
bats, with almost human faces like vampires, hovered over it, while
black and grey smoke wreaths of noisome vapor rose from its decaying
surface, and hung over it in weird fantastic phantom shapes that shifted
and changed ever and anon into fresh forms of ugliness--now waving aloft
wild arms and shaking, nodding, gibbering heads, which seemed almost
endowed with sense and speech--then melting into mist again to form into
some new creature of repulsive horror.

On the shores of this great foul sea were innumerable crawling slimy
creatures of hideous shape and gigantic size that lay sprawling on their
backs or plunged into that horrid sea. I shuddered as I looked upon it
and was about to ask if there could indeed be lost souls struggling in
that filthy slime, when my ears heard a chorus of wailing cries and
calls for help coming from the darkness before me, that touched my heart
with their mournful hopelessness, and my eyes, growing more accustomed
to the mist, distinguished here and there struggling human forms wading
up to their armpits in the mud. I called to them and told them to try
and walk towards me, for I was on the shore, but they either could not
see or could not hear me for they took no notice, and my companion said
he believed they were both deaf and blind to everything but their
immediate surroundings. He had been in the sea of foul mud himself for a
time, but had managed to struggle out, though he had understood that
most were unable to do so without help from another, and that some went
on stumbling about in it for years. Again we heard those pitiful cries,
and one sounded so near us that I thought of plunging in myself and
trying to drag the wretched spirit out, but faugh! it was too horrible,
too disgusting. I recoiled in horror at the thought. And then again that
despairing cry smote upon my ears and made me feel I must venture it. So
in I went, trying my best to stifle my sense of disgust, and, guided by
the cries, soon reached the man, the great phantoms of the mist wavering
and swooping and rushing overhead as I did so. He was up to his neck in
the mud and seemed sinking lower when I found him, and it seemed
impossible for me alone to draw him out, so I called to the pirate
spirit to come and help me, but he was nowhere to be seen. Thinking he
had only led me into a trap and deserted me, I was about to turn and
struggle out again, when the unfortunate spirit besought me so pitifully
not to abandon him that I made another great effort and succeeded in
dragging him a few yards and drawing his feet out of a trap of weeds at
the bottom in which they appeared to be caught. Then, somehow, I half
dragged, half supported him till we reached the shore where the
unfortunate spirit sank down in unconsciousness. I was a good deal
exhausted also and sat down beside him to rest. I looked round for my
pirate friend, and beheld him wallowing about in the sea at some
distance and evidently bringing out someone along with him. Even in the
midst of my awful surroundings I could not help feeling a certain sense
of amusement in looking at him, he made such frantic and exaggerated
efforts to haul along the unlucky spirit, and was so shouting and going
on that it was calculated to alarm anyone who was timid, and I did not
wonder to hear the poor spirit almost imploring not to be so energetic,
to take it a little slower, and to give him time to follow. I went over
to them, and the poor rescued one being now near the shore I helped to
get him out and to let him rest beside the other one.

The pirate spirit seemed greatly delighted with his successful efforts
and very proud of himself, and was quite ready to set off again, so I
sent him after someone else whom we heard calling, and was attending to
the other two when I again heard most pitiful wailings not far from me,
though I could see no one at first, then a faint, tiny speck of light
like a will-o'-the-wisp glimmered in the darkness of that disgusting
swamp, and by its light I saw someone moving about and calling for aid,
so, not very willingly, I confess, I went into the mud again. When I
reached the man I found he had a woman with him whom he was supporting
and trying to encourage, and with considerable trouble I got them both
out and found the pirate spirit had also arrived with his rescued one.

Truly a strange group we must have made on the shores of that slimy sea,
which I learned afterwards was the spiritual creation of all the
disgusting thoughts, all the impure desires of the lives of men on
earth, attracted and collected into this great swamp of foulness. Those
spirits who were thus wallowing in it had reveled in such low
abominations in their earth lives and had continued to enjoy such
pleasures after death through the mediumship of mortal men and women,
till at last even the earth plane had become too high for them by reason
of their own exceeding vileness, and they had been drawn down by the
force of attraction into this horrible sink of corruption to wander in
it till the very disgust of themselves should work a cure.

One man I had rescued had been one of the celebrated wits of Charles the
Second's court, and after his death had long haunted the earth plane,
sinking, however, lower and lower till he had sunk into this sea at
last, the weeds of his pride and arrogance forming chains in which his
feet were so entangled that he could not move till I released him.
Another man had been a celebrated dramatist of the reign of the early
Georges. While the man and woman had belonged to the court of Louis the
Fifteenth and had been drawn together to this place. Those rescued by
the pirate were somewhat similar in their histories.

I had been somewhat troubled at first as to how I was going to free
myself from the mud of that horrible sea, but I now suddenly saw a small
clear fountain of pure water spring up near to us as if by magic, and in
its fresh stream we soon washed all traces of the mud away.

I now advised those whom we had rescued to try what they could do to
help others in this land of darkness as a return for the help given to
themselves, and having given them what advice and help I could I started
once more upon my pilgrimage. The pirate, however, seemed so very
unwilling to part from me that we two set forth together once more.

I shall not attempt to describe all whom we sought to help in our
wanderings. Were I to do so this narrative would fill volumes and
probably only weary my readers, so I shall pass over what seemed to me
like weeks of earthly time, as nearly as I am able to reckon it, and
will describe our arrival at a vast range of mountains whose bleak
summits towered into the night sky overhead. We were both somewhat
discouraged with the results of our efforts to help people. Here and
there we had found a few who were willing to listen and to be helped,
but as a rule our attempts had been met with scorn and derision, while
not a few had even attacked us for interfering with them, and we had
some trouble to save ourselves from injury.

Our last attempt had been with a man and woman of most repulsive
appearance who were fighting at the door of a wretched hovel. The man
was beating her so terribly I could not but interfere to stop him.
Whereupon they both set on me at once, the woman spirit doing her best
to scratch my eyes out, and I was glad to have the pirate come to my
assistance, for, truth to tell, the combined attack had made me lose my
temper, and by doing so I put myself for the moment on their level, and
so was deprived of the protection afforded me by my superior spiritual
development.

These two had been guilty of a most cruel and brutal murder of an old
man (the husband of the woman) for the sake of his money; and they had
been hanged for the crime, their mutual guilt forming a bond between
them so strong that they had been drawn down together and were unable to
separate in spite of the bitter hatred they now felt for each other.
Each felt the other to be the cause of their being in this place, and
each felt the other more guilty than themselves, and it had been their
eagerness each to betray the other which had helped to hang both. Now
they seemed simply to exist in order to fight together, and I can fancy
no punishment more awful than theirs must have been, thus linked
together in hate.

In their present state of mind it was not possible to help them in any
way.

Shortly after leaving this interesting couple we found ourselves at the
foot of the great dark mountains, and by the aid of a curious pale
phosphorescent glow which hung in patches over them we were able to
explore them a little. There were no regular pathways, and the rocks
were very steep, so we stumbled up as best we might--for I should
explain that by taking on a certain proportion of the conditions of this
low sphere I had lost the power to rise at will and float, which was a
privilege of those who had reached the Land of Dawn. After a toilsome
ascent of one of the lower ranges of the mountains we began to tramp
along the crest of one, faintly lighted by the strange gleaming patches
of phosphorescent light, and beheld on either side of us vast deep
chasms in the rocks, gloomy precipices, and awful looking black pits.
From some of these came wailing cries and moans and occasionally prayers
for help. I was much shocked to think there were spirits down in such
depths of misery, and felt quite at a loss how to help them, when my
companion, who had shown a most remarkable eagerness to second all my
efforts to rescue people, suggested that we should make a rope from some
of the great rank, withered-looking weeds and grass that grew in small
crevices of these otherwise barren rocks, and with such a rope I could
lower him down, as he was more used to climbing in that fashion than I,
and thus we might be able to draw up some of these spirits out of their
dreadful position.

This was a good idea, so we set to work and soon had a rope strong
enough to bear the weight of my friend, for you should know that in
spiritual, as well as in material things, weight is a matter of
comparison, and the materiality of those low spheres will give them a
much greater solidity and weight than belongs to a spirit sphere more
advanced, and though to your material eyes of earth life my pirate
friend would have shown neither distinct material form nor weight, yet a
very small development of your spiritual faculties would have enabled
you to both see and feel his presence, though a spirit the next degree
higher would still remain invisible to you. Thus I am not in error, nor
do I even say what is improbable, when I thus speak of my friend's
weight, which for a rope made of spiritual grass and weeds was as great
a strain as would have been the case with an earthly man and earth
materials. Having made one end of the rope fast to a rock, the spirit
descended with the speed and sureness acquired by long practice as a
sailor. Once there he soon made it fast round the body of the poor
helpless one whom he found lying moaning at the bottom. Then I drew up
the rope and the spirit, and when he had been made safe I lowered it to
my friend and drew him up, and having done what we could for the rescued
one we went on and helped a few more in like fashion.

When we had pulled out as many as we could find, a most strange thing
happened. The phosphorescent light died out and left us in utter
darkness, while a mysterious voice floating, as it seemed, in the air,
said, "Go on now, your work here is done. Those whom you have rescued
were caught in their own traps, and the pitfalls that they made for
others had received themselves, till that time when repentance and a
desire to atone should draw rescuers to help them and free them from the
prisons they had themselves made. In these mountains are many spirits
imprisoned who may not yet be helped out by any, for they would only be
a danger to others were they free, and the ruin and evil they would shed
around make their longer imprisonment a necessity. Yet are their prisons
of their own creating, for these great mountains of misery are the
outcome and product of men's earthly lives, and these precipices are but
the spiritual counterparts of those precipices of despair over which
they have in earthly life driven their unhappy victims. Not till their
hearts soften, not till they have learned to long for liberty that they
may do good instead of evil, will their prisons be opened and they be
drawn forth from the living death in which their own frightful cruelties
to others have entombed them."

The voice ceased, and alone and in darkness we groped our way down the
mountain side till we reached the level ground once more. Those awful
mysterious dark valleys of eternal night--those towering mountains of
selfishness and oppression--had struck such a chill to my heart that I
was glad indeed to know there was no call of duty for me to linger
longer there.

Our wandering now brought us to an immense forest, whose weird fantastic
trees were like what one sees in some awful nightmare. The leafless
branches seemed like living arms held out to grasp and hold the hapless
wanderer. The long snake-like roots stretched out like twisting ropes to
trip him up. The trunks were bare and blackened as though scorched by
the blasting breath of fire. From the bark a thick foul slime oozed and
like powerful wax held fast any hand that touched it. Great waving
shrouds of some strange dark air plant clothed the branches like a pall,
and helped to enfold and bewilder any who tried to penetrate through
this ghostly forest. Faint muffled cries as of those who are exhausted
and half smothered came from this awful wood, and here and there we
could see the imprisoned souls held captive in the embrace of these
extraordinary prisons, struggling to get free, yet unable to move one
single step.

"How," I wondered, "shall we help these?" Some were caught by the
foot--a twisted root holding them as in a vice. Another's hand was glued
to the trunk of a tree. Another was enveloped in a shroud of the black
moss, while yet another's head and shoulders were held fast by a couple
of branches which had closed upon them. Wild ferocious looking beasts
prowled round them, and huge vultures flapped their wings overhead, yet
seemed unable to touch any of the prisoners, though they came so near.

"Who are those men and women?" I asked.

"They are those," was the reply, "who viewed with delight the sufferings
of others, those who gave their fellow men to be torn in pieces by wild
beasts that they might enjoy the excitement of their sufferings. They
are all those who for no reason but the lust of cruelty have, in many
different ways and in many different ages, tortured and entrapped and
killed those who were more helpless than themselves, and for all now
here release will only come when they have learned the lesson of mercy
and pity for others and the desire to save some one else from suffering,
even at the expense of suffering to themselves. Then will these bands
and fetters which hold them be loosed, then they will be free to go
forth and work out their atonement. Till then no one else can help
them--none can release them. Their release must be effected by
themselves through their own more merciful desires and aspirations. If
you will but recall the history of your earth and think how men in all
ages have enslaved, oppressed and tortured their fellow men in every
country of that globe, you will not wonder that this vast forest should
be well peopled. It was deemed right that for your own instruction you
should see this fearful place, but as none of those you see and pity
have so far changed their hearts that you can give them aid, you will
now pass on to another region where you can do more good."

After leaving the Forest of Desolation we had not gone far upon our road
when to my joy I saw my friend Hassein approaching. Mindful, however, of
Ahrinziman's warning I gave him the sign agreed upon and received the
countersign in return. He had come, he said, with a message from my
father and from my beloved who had sent me what were indeed sweet words
of love and encouragement. Hassein told me that my mission would now lie
amongst those great masses of spirits whose evil propensities were
equalled only by their intellectual powers, and their ingenuity in works
of evil. "They are those," said he, "who were rulers of men and kings of
intellect in all branches, but who have perverted and abused the powers
with which they were endowed till they have made of them a curse and not
a blessing. With most of them you will have to guard yourself at all
points against the allurements they will hold out to tempt you, and the
treachery of every kind they will practice on yourself. Yet amongst them
are a few whom you are sent to succor and whom your own instinct and
events will point out as those to whom your words will be welcome and
your aid valuable. I shall not in all probability bring you messages
again, but some other may be sent to do so, and you must, above all
things and before all things, remember to distrust any who come to you
and cannot give the sign and symbol I have given. You are now in reality
about to invade the enemies' camp, and you will find that your errand is
known to them and resented, whatever it may suit them to pretend.
Beware, then, of all their false promises, and when they seem most
friendly distrust them most."

I promised to remember and heed his warning, and he added that it was
necessary I should part for a time from my faithful companion, the
pirate, as he could not safely accompany me in those scenes to which my
path would now lead, but he promised he would place him under the care
of one who could and would help him to leave that dark country soon.

After giving him loving and helpful messages to my beloved and my
father, which he promised to deliver to them, we parted, and I set forth
in the direction pointed out, greatly cheered and comforted by the good
news and loving messages I had received.
