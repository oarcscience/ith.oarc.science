### CHAPTER IV

WHEN thou beholdest the deep above the earth thou oughtest not to say
that it is *not* the gate of God where God in his holiness dwells: No,
no, think not so, for the whole Holy Trinity, God the Father, Son and
Holy Ghost, dwells in the centre under the firmament of heaven, though
that very firmament cannot comprehend him.

Indeed all is as it were one body, the outermost and the innermost
moving together with the firmament of heaven, as also the astral moving
therein, in and with which the wrath of God unfolds; but yet they are
one to another as the government, frame or constitution in man.

The flesh marks the outward moving,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

which is the house of death. The second moving in man is the astral, in
which the life stands, and wherein love and wrath wrestle one with
another. Thus far man himself knows himself, for the astral generates
the life in the outermost, that is, in the flesh. The third moving is
generated between the astral and the outermost, and is called the
animated or soulish moving, or the soul, and is as great as the whole
man.

That moving the outward man neither knows nor comprehends, neither does
the astral comprehend it; but every fountain spirit comprehends its
innate source, which resembles the heaven.

The animated or soulish man must press through the firmament of heaven
to God, and live with God, else the whole man cannot come into heaven to
God.

Man cannot be wholly pure from wrath and sin, for the movings of the
depth in

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

this world are not fully pure before the Heart of God; always love and
wrath wrestle one with another.

In the second, the astral, wherein now the love and the wrath are
against one another, is a spirit of the life, and of the firmament of
heaven which is of the midst of the spirit.

And the Devil can reach half into this moving, so far as the wrath
reaches and no farther; therefore the Devil cannot know how the other
part in this moving has its source. This other part of the astral, which
abides in the love, is the firmament of heaven holding captive the
kindled wrath; together with all the devils, for they cannot enter
thereinto. In that heaven dwells the Holy Spirit, which goes forth from
the Heart of God, and strives against the wrath, and generates to
himself a temple in the midst of the fierceness of the wrath of God.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

And in this heaven dwells the man that fears God, even while alive in
the body here upon earth; for that heaven is as well in man as in the
deep above the earth. And as the deep above the earth is, so is man
also, both in love and wrath, till after the departure of the soul; but
when the soul departs from the body, then it abides either only in the
heaven of love or only in the wrath.

And in this heaven the holy angels dwell amongst us, and the devils in
the other part. In this heaven man lives between heaven and hell, and
must suffer from the wrath and endure many hard blows, temptations,
persecutions; and, many times, torments and oppression.

The wrath is called the Cross, and the love-heaven is called patience,
and the spirit that rises up therein is called hope and faith, which
unites with God and wrestles with the wrath till it overcomes and gets
the victory.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

O ye theologists, the spirit here opens a door and gate for you! If you
will not now see and feed your sheep and lambs on a green meadow,
instead of a dry, parched heath, you must be accountable for it before
the severe, earnest and wrathful judgement of God; therefore look to it.

I take heaven to witness that I do here what I must. The Spirit drives
me to it, so that I am wholly led captive thereby, and cannot be freed
from it whatever may befal me hereafter, or ensue upon it.

 

The third moving in the body of God in this world is hidden. In it is
the almighty and holy Heart of God, wherein our King, Jesus Christ, with
his natural body, sits at the right hand of God, as a King and Lord of
the whole body of this world.

The body of Christ is no more in the hard palpability, but in the divine
palpability, of nature, like the angels. Our bodies also at the
resurrection will have no

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

more such hard flesh and bones, but be like the angels; and though
indeed all forms and powers shall be therein, yet we shall not have the
hard palpability.

Christ says to Mary Magdalen in Joseph's garden at the Sepulchre, after
his resurrection, *Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my God and
to your God*, as if he would say, I have not now the animal body any
more, although I show myself to thee in my form or shape which I had,
because otherwise thou in thy animal body couldst not see me.

So during the forty days after his resurrection he did not always walk
visibly among the disciples, but invisibly, according to his heavenly
and angelical property. When he would speak or talk with his disciples,
then he showed himself in a palpable manner and form, that thereby he
might speak natural words with them, for corruption cannot apprehend the
divine. Also it sufficiently appears that his body

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

was of an angelical kind, in that he went to his disciples through the
doors, being shut.

Thus thou must know that his body unites with all the seven spirits in
nature in the astral moving in the part of love; and holds sin, death
and the Devil captive in its wrath part.

Thou seest also how thou art in this world everywhere in heaven and also
in hell, and dwellest between heaven and hell in great danger. Thou
seest how heaven is in a holy man, and that everywhere, wheresoever thou
standest, goest or liest, if thy spirit does but co-operate with God,
then as to that part thou art in heaven and thy soul is in God.
Therefore says Christ: My sheep are in my hands, no man can pull them
away from me.

In like manner thou seest also how thou art always in hell among all the
devils as to the wrath; if thine eyes were but open thou wouldst see
wonderful things, but

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

thou standest between heaven and hell, and canst see neither of them,
and walkest upon a very narrow bridge.

Some men have many times, in the astral spirit, entered in thither,
being ravished in an ecstasy, as men term it, and have in this life
known the gates of heaven and of hell, and have shown and declared how
that many men dwell in hell with their living bodies. Such indeed have
been scorned, derided or laughed at, but with great ignorance and
indiscretion, for it is just so as they declare.
