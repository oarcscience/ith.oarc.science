### CHAPTER VII

THANKS be to God who has regenerated me, by water and the Holy Ghost, to
be a living creature, so that I can in his Light see my great inbred
vices, which are in my flesh.

Thus now I live in the spirit of this world in my flesh, and my flesh
serves the spirit of this world; but my mind serves God. My flesh is
generated in this world and is ruled by the quintessence of the stars
and elements, which dwells in it and is master of the body and the
outward life; but my mind is regenerated in God and loves God. And
although o I cannot now comprehend and hold fast the divine wisdom,
because my mind falls into sins, yet the spirit of this world

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

shall not always thus hold captive my mind.

For the Virgin, the divine Wisdom, has given me her promise not to leave
me in any misery; she will come to help me in the Son of Wisdom. I must
hold fast to him, and he will bring me to her in paradise. I will make
the venture, and go through the thistles and thorns as well as I can,
till I find my native country where Wisdom dwells. I rely upon her
faithful promise, when she appeared to me, that she would turn all my
mourning into great joy. When I lay upon the mountain at midnight, so
that all the trees fell upon me and all the storms and winds beat upon
me, and Antichrist gaped at me with his open jaws to devour me, then she
came and comforted me and took me for her own.

Therefore I am but the more cheerful, and care not for him; he rules
over me no further than over the transitory house of flesh, whose patron
he is; he may take

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

that quite away, but so I shall come into my native country. Yet he is
not absolute lord over that house, he is but God's ape; for as an ape
plays all manner of tricks and pranks to make itself sport, and would
fain seem to be the finest and the nimblest of beasts, so also does he.
His power hangs on the great tree of this world, and a storm of wind can
blow it away.

 

Thou wilt ask, What is the new regeneration? or how is that done in man?
Hear and see, close not thy mind, let it not be filled by the spirit of
this world with its might and pomp. Lay hold upon thy mind and break
through the spirit of this world entirely; yield thy mind unto the kind
love of God; make thy purpose earnest and strong to overcome the
pleasure of this world and not to regard it. Consider that thou art not
at home in this world, but art a strange guest, made captive in a
prison; cry and call to him who has the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

key of the prison; yield thyself up to him in obedience, righteousness,
humility, purity and truth. And seek not so eagerly after the kingdom of
this world; it will stick close enough to thee without that. Then the
pure Virgin, the Wisdom of God, will meet thee in the height and depth
of thy mind, and will lead thee to him who has the key to the gate of
the deep. Thou must stand before him and he will give thee to eat of the
heavenly manna which will quicken and refresh thee. Thou wilt be strong,
and wilt break through the gate of the deep as the morning star, and
though thou liest captive here in the night yet the rays of the dawn
will appear to thee in paradise, where thy pure Virgin stands, waiting
for thee with the joy of the angels, who will kindly receive thee in thy
newborn mind and spirit. And though indeed here thou must walk, as to
thy body, in the dark night, yet the noble Virgin will help thee still.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Look well to it, close not thy mind and understanding; when thy mind
says, Turn, then know that so thou art called by the Wisdom of God; turn
instantly, and consider where thou art lodged, in how hard a house of
bondage thy soul lies imprisoned; seek thy native country from whence
thy soul is wandered and whither it should return again.

Then if thou wilt follow the counsel of the Wisdom of God thou wilt find
in thyself, not only after this life, but also in this life in thy
regeneration, that Wisdom will very worthily meet thee. And thou wilt
see out of what kind of spirit this author has wrote.
