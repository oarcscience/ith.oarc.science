### CHAPTER V

THE Simple says, God made all things out of nothing; but he knows not
God, neither does he know what he himself is. When he beholds the earth
together with the deep above the earth, he thinks verily all this is
*not* God; or else he thinks God is *not there*. He always imagines with
himself that God dwells only above the azure heaven of the stars, and
rules, as it were, by means of some spirit which goes forth from him
into this world; and that his body is not present here upon the earth or
in the earth.

Just such opinions and tenets I have read also in the books and writings
of Doctors, and there are also very many opinions, disputations and
controversies

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

risen about this very thing among the Learned.

But seeing God opens to me the gate of his Being in his great love, and
remembers the covenants which he has with man, therefore I will
faithfully and earnestly, according to my gifts, set wide open all the
gates of God, so far as he will give me leave.

It is not so to be understood, as that I am sufficient in these things,
but only so far as I am able to comprehend.

For the Being of God is like a wheel, wherein many wheels are made one
in another, upwards, downwards, crossways, and yet continually turn all
of them together.

At which indeed, when a man beholds the wheel, he highly marvels, and
cannot at once in its turning learn to conceive and apprehend it. But
the more he beholds the wheel the more he learns its form; and the more
he learns the greater

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

longing he has towards the wheel, for he continually sees something that
is more and more wonderful, so that a man can neither behold nor learn
it enough.

Thus I also. What I do not fully describe in one place concerning this
great mystery, that you will find in another place; and what I cannot
describe here in regard of the greatness of this mystery and my
incapacity, that you will find elsewhere.

For here is the first sprouting or vegetation of this twig, which
springs in its mother, and is as a child which is learning to walk and
is not able to run apace at the first.

Though the spirit sees the wheel and would fain comprehend its form in
every place, yet it cannot do it exactly enough because of the turning
of the wheel. But when it comes about that the spirit can see the first
apprehended form again, then continually it learns more and more, and

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

always loves and delights in the wheel, and longs after it still more
and more.

Now observe: The earth has just such qualities and quality-expressing or
fountain spirits as the deep above the earth, or as heaven has, and all
of them together belong to one only body. The universal God is that one
only body. But sin is the cause that thou dost not wholly see and know
him. With and by sin thou, within this great divine body, liest shut up
in the mortal flesh; and the power and virtue of God is hidden from
thee, even as the marrow in the bones is hidden from the flesh.

But if thou in the spirit breakest through the death of the flesh, then
thou seest the hidden God. For the mortal flesh belongs not to the
moving of life, so it cannot receive or conceive the Life of the Light
as proper to itself; but the Life of the Light in God rises up in the
flesh and generates to itself, from out of it, another,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

a heavenly and living, body, which knows and understands the Light.

The mortal body is but a husk from which the new body grows, as it is
with a grain of wheat in the earth. The husk shall not rise and be
living again, no more with the body than with the grain, but will remain
for ever in death.

Behold the mystery of the earth: as that brings forth so must thou bring
forth. The earth is not that body which is brought forth, but is the
mother of that body; as also thy flesh is not the spirit but is the
mother of the spirit.

And in both of them, in the earth and in thy flesh, the Light of the
clear Deity is hidden, and it breaks through and gathers to itself a
body for each after its kind.

As the mother is, so also is the child: man's child is the soul which is
born in the astral moving from the flesh; and the earth's child is the
grass, the herbs, the trees, silver, gold, and all mineral ores.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Out of the earth sprang grass, herbs and trees; and in the earth silver,
gold, and all manner of ore came to be. In the deep above the earth
sprang the wonderful forming of power and virtue.

 

I now invite all lovers of the holy and highly to be esteemed arts of
philosophy and theology before this mirror wherein I lay open the root
and ground of these matters.

I use not their tables, formulas, or schemes, rules and ways, for I have
not learned from them. I have another teacher, which is the living
fountain of nature.

What could I, simple layman, teach or write of their high art if it was
not given to me by the Spirit of nature, in whom I live and am? Should I
oppose the Spirit that he should not open where and in whom he pleases?

O thou child of man, open the eyes of

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

thy spirit, for I will show thee here the right and real proper gate of
God.

Behold! that is the true, one, only God out of whom thou art created and
in whom thou livest; and when thou beholdest the deep and the stars and
the earth, then thou beholdest thy God. In that same thou livest and
hast thy being; and that same God rules thee also, and from that same
God thou hast thy senses. Thou art a creature from him and in him; else
thou wouldst never have been.

Now perhaps thou wilt say that I write in a heathenish manner. Hearken
and behold! Observe the distinct understanding how all this is so; for I
write not heathenishly, but in the love of wisdom; neither am I a
heathen, but I have the true knowledge of the one only great God who is
All.

When thou beholdest the deep, the stars, the elements and the earth,
then thou comprehendest not with thine eyes the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

bright and clear Deity, though indeed he is there and in them; but thou
seest and comprehendest, with thine eyes, first death and then the wrath
of God.

But if thou liftest up thy thoughts and dost consider where God is, then
thou shalt comprehend the astral moving, where love and wrath move one
against another. And when by faith thou drawest near to God who rules in
holiness in this dominion, then thou layest hold on him in his holy
Heart.

When this is done, then thou art as God is, who himself is heaven,
earth, stars and the elements.
