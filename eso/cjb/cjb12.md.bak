### CHAPTER X

THE law of God and also the way to life is written in our hearts; it
lies in no man's supposing, nor in any historical opinion, but in a good
will and well doing. The will leadeth us to God or to the Devil; it
availeth not that thou hast the name of a Christian, salvation doth not
consist therein. A heathen and a Turk is as near to God as thou who art
under the name of Christ; if thou bringest forth a false ungodly will in
thy deeds, thou art as much without God as a heathen that hath no desire
nor will to him. And if a Turk seeketh God with earnestness, though he
walketh in blindness, yet he is of the company of those that are
children without understanding, and he reacheth to God

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

with the children which do not yet know what they speak; for this lies
not in the knowing but in the will.

We are all blind concerning God; but we put our earnest will into him
and into goodness, and so desire him; then we receive him into our will,
so that we are born in him in our will.

Dost thou boast of thy calling, that thou art a Christian? Indeed let
thy conversation be accordingly, or else thou art but a heathen in the
will and in the deed. He that knoweth his Master's will and doeth it not
must receive many stripes.

Dost thou not know what Christ said concerning the two sons? When the
father says to one of them, Go and do such a thing, and he said he
would; and the other said, No; the first went away and did it not, but
the other, that said No, went away and did it, and so did the will of
his father; the one that was under the name of obedience did it not.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

And we are all such, one and another; we bear the name of Christ and are
called Christians and are within his covenant: we have said, Yes, we
will do it; but they that do it not are unprofitable servants and live
without the will of the Father.

But if the Turks, as also the Jews, do the Father's will, who say to
Christ, No, and discern him not; who is now their judge to thrust them
out from the will of the Father? Is not the Son the Heart of the Father?
If they honour the Father they lay hold also on his Heart, for beyond
his Heart there is no God.

Dost thou suppose that I encourage them in their blindness that they
should go on as they do? No: I show thee thy blindness, O thou that
bearest the name of Christ! Thou judgest others, and yet dost the same
thing which thou judgest in others, and so thou wilfully bringest the
judgement of God upon thyself.

He that saith: Love your enemies, do

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

well to them that persecute you, doth not teach you to condemn and
despise, but he teacheth you the way of meekness; you should be a light
to the world, that heathens may see that you are the children of God.

If we consider ourselves according to the true man, who is a similitude
and image of God, then we find God in us, yet ourselves without God. And
the only remedy consisteth herein, that we enter again into ourselves
and so enter into God in our hidden man. If we incline our wills in true
earnest singleness of mind to God, then we go with Christ out from this
world, out from the stars and elements, and enter into God; for in the
will of earthly reason we are children of the stars and elements, and
the spirit of this world ruleth over us.

But if we go out from the will of this world and enter into God, then
the spirit of God ruleth in us and establisheth us for his children.
Then also the garland of

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

paradise is set upon the soul, and it becometh a child without
understanding after this world. It hath lost the ruler of this world,
who once ruled it and led it in the earthly reason.

O man! consider who leadeth and driveth thee, for eternally without end
is very long. Temporal honour and goods are but dross in the sight of
God; it all falleth into the grave with thee and cometh to nothing: but
to be in the will of God is eternal riches and honour; there, there is
no more care, but our Mother careth for us in whose bosom we live as
children.

Thy temporal honour is thy snare and thy misery; in divine hope and
confidence is thy garden of roses.

Dost thou suppose again that I speak from hearsay? No, I speak the very
life in my own experience; not in an opinion from the mouth of another,
but from my own knowledge. I see with my own eyes;

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

which I boast not of, for the power is the Mother's. I exhort thee to
enter into the bosom of the Mother, and learn also to see with thy own
eyes: so long as thou dost suffer thyself to be rocked in a cradle and
dost desire the eyes of others thou art blind. But if thou risest up
from the cradle and dost go to the Mother, then thou shalt discern the
Mother and her children.

O how good it is to see with one's own eyes! We are all asleep in the
outward man, we lie in the cradle and suffer ourselves to be rocked
asleep by the outward reason; we see with the eyes of the dissimulation
of our play-actors, who hang bells and baubles about our ears and
cradles, that we may be lulled asleep or at least play with baubles, and
they may be lords and masters in the house.

Rise up from thy cradle: art thou not a child of the Mother, and
moreover a child and lord of the house, and an heir

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

to its goods? Why sufferest thou thy servants thus to use thee? Christ
saith: I am the Light of the World, he that followeth me shall have the
light of the eternal life. He doth not direct us to the play-actors, but
only to himself. With the inward eyes we must see in his light: so we
shall see him, for he is the Light; and when we see him then we walk in
the light. He is the Morning Star and is generated in us and riseth in
us, and shineth in our bodily darkness.

O how great a triumph is there in the soul when he ariseth! Then a man
seeth with his own eyes, and knoweth that he is in a strange lodging,
concerning which I here write what I see and know in the light.

I declare unto you that the eternal Being, and also this world, is like
man. Eternity bringeth to birth nothing but that which is like itself;
as you find man to be, just so is eternity. Consider man

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

in body and soul, in good and evil, in joy and sorrow, in light and
darkness, in power and weakness, in life and death: all is in man, both
heaven and the earth, stars, and elements; also the threefold God.

O man! seek thyself and thou shalt find thyself. Open the eyes of thy
inward man and see rightly.

This is the noble precious stone, the philosopher's stone, which wise
men find. O thou bright crown of pearl, art thou not brighter than the
sun? There is nothing like thee; thou art so very manifest, and yet so
very secret that among many thousand in this world thou art scarce
rightly known of anyone. Yet thou art borne by many that know thee not.

Christ saith, Seek and thou shalt find. The noble stone must be sought
for; a lazy man findeth it not; though he carrieth it about with him he
knoweth it not. To whomsoever it revealeth itself, he hath all joy
therein, for its virtue is endless. He

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

that hath it doth not give it away; if he doth impart it to any it is
not profitable to him that is lazy, who diveth not into its virtue to
learn that.

The seeker findeth the stone and its virtue and benefit together. When
he findeth it and knows that he is certain of it, there is greater joy
in him than the world is able to apprehend; no pen can describe nor any
tongue express it in the manner of the world.

It is accounted in the world's eyes the meanest of all stones and is
trodden under foot. If a man light upon it he casteth it away as an
unprofitable thing. None enquire after it, though there is none upon
earth but desires it. All great ones and wise seek it. Indeed they find
one and think it the true stone; but they mistake it. They ascribe power
and virtue to it and think they have it and will keep it. But the true
stone is not thus: it needeth no virtue to be ascribed to it, all virtue

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

lies hid in it. He who has it, and has knowledge of it, if he seeks, may
find all things whatsoever, in heaven and in earth. It is the stone
which is rejected of the builders, the chief corner-stone.

 

O you Sophisters! that out of envy often revile honest hearts according
to your own pleasure, how will you be able to stand with those lambs
whom you should have led into the fresh green pastures of the way of
Christ, into love, purity and humility?

I speak not this out of a desire to reproach any man; I discover only
the smoky pit of the Devil that it may be seen what is in man, as well
in one as in another, unless he be born anew and resisteth the spirit of
the Devil and thrusteth it away from him.

There is another Devil more crafty and cunning than this, a glistering
angel with cloven feet. He, when he seeth a

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

poor soul afraid, and desiring to repent and amend, saith, Pray, and be
devout; repent for once in a way. But when the poor soul goes about to
pray, he slippeth into his heart and taketh away the understanding of
the heart, and putteth it into mere doubting, as if God did not hear it.

So the heart standeth and repeateth over the words of a prayer, as if it
were learning to say something without book; and the soul cannot reach
the centre of nature; it hath only rehearsed words, not in the spirit of
a soul in the centre where the fire is kindled, but only in the mouth,
in the spirit of this world. Its words vanish in the air or as those
wherein God's name is taken in vain.

There belongeth great earnestness to prayer; for praying is calling upon
God, entreating him and speaking with him, going out of the house of sin
and entering the house of God. If the Devil offers to hinder it, then
storm his hell. Set

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

thyself against him as he setteth himself against thee, and then thou
shalt find what is here told thee. If he opposes strongly, then oppose
thou the more strongly; thou hast, in Christ, greater power than he.

Do but fix thy trust and confidence upon the promise of Christ, and let
thy storming be grounded in the death of Christ, in his sufferings and
wounds, and in his love. Dispute no further about thy sins, for the
Devil involveth himself therein and upbraideth thee for them, that thou
mightest despair. If thou doubtest of the grace of God thou dost sin
greatly, for he is always merciful; there is no other will in him at all
but to be merciful. He cannot do otherwise; his arms are spread abroad
day and night towards the poor sinner.

Make trial in this manner, and thou wilt quickly see and feel another
man, with another sense and thoughts and understanding. I speak as I
know and have

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

found by experience; a soldier knows how it is in the wars. This I write
out of love, as one who telleth in the spirit how it hath gone with
himself, for an example to others, to try if any would follow him and
find out how true it is.
