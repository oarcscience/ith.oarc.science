### CHAPTER 13.

*Charles G. Finney*.

1792–1875.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> case is of more than usual interest
from the fact that although in it occurred almost certainly, although
not strongly marked, the phenomenon of the subjective light, together
with pronounced moral exaltation and probably some intellectual
illumination, yet it was not crowned by the Cosmic vision—the Brahmin
Splendor. It is not therefore complete, but only partial or imperfect.

That the illumination of Charles G. Finney was not accompanied by the
consciousness of the Cosmos is certain because the account of the Cosmic
vision, had this been present, could not have been omitted from his
relation of his "conversion," of which it would have been the most
striking feature—the very core and centre. What he did see and feel was
wonderful and striking enough. How surprised, and probably how
incredulous, would he have been if he could have been told that although
he had reached the threshold of and strongly felt the Divine Presence to
which he was so close, that yet the vision which would have meant so
much to him was still hidden behind the veil of sense and for the time
denied to him!

So this man's life, though by the experience of that autumn day
infinitely exalted as compared with that of the average self conscious
man, is yet just as markedly below that of the men who have not only
felt the Infinite One as Charles G. Finney felt him, but have passed
into His presence and seen His inconceivable glory.

The distinction pointed out may be clearly realized by making a
comparison of the book Charles G. Finney has left us with the
epoch-making books—the Suttas (for instance), the Gospels, the Epistles,
the Qur’an, the "Divine Comedy," the "Shakespeare" works, the "Comédie
Humaine," the "Leaves of Grass" and the

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

rest—inspired or written by the men to whom has been shown the Brahmic
Splendor as a visible fact.

The illumination of Charles G. Finney took place early in his thirtieth
year—that is, in October, 1821. He had the usual earnest religious
temperament, and for some time had been greatly troubled about his
spiritual state, eagerly desiring, but unable to reach assurance of,
salvation. Then occurred what he calls his "conversion." He says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

The rising of my soul was so great that I rushed into the room behind
the front office, to pray.

There was no fire and no light in the room; nevertheless it appeared as
if it were perfectly light. As I went in and shut the door it seemed as
if I met the Lord Jesus Christ face to face. It did not occur to me that
it was wholly a mental state; it seemed that I saw him as I would see
any other man. He said nothing, but looked at me in such a manner as to
break me right down at his feet. I have always since regarded this as a
most remarkable state of mind; for it seemed that he stood before me,
and I fell down at his feet and poured out my soul to him. I wept aloud
like a child, and made such confessions as I could with my choked
utterance.

I must have continued in this state for a good while; but my mind was
too much absorbed to recollect anything I said. But I know, as soon as
my mind became calm, I returned to the front office, and found that the
fire, that I had made of large wood, was nearly burned out. But as I
turned and was about to take a seat by the fire, I received a mighty
baptism of the Holy Ghost. Without any expectation of it, without ever
having the thought in my mind that there was any such thing for me,
without any recollection that I had ever heard the thing mentioned by
any person in the world, the Holy Spirit descended upon me in a manner
that seemed to go through me, body and soul.

No words can express the wonderful love that was shed abroad in my
heart. I wept aloud with joy and love; and I do not know, but I should
say, I literally bellowed out the unutterable gushings of my heart.
These waves came over me, and over me, and over me, one after the other,
until I recollect I cried out, "I shall die if these waves continue to
pass over me." I said, "Lord, I cannot bear any more;" yet I had no fear
of death.

How long I continued in this state I do not know. But it was late in the
evening when a member of my choir came to see me. He was a member of the
church. He found me in this state of loud weeping, and said, "Mr.
Finney, what ails you?" I could make him no answer for some time. He
then said, "Are you in pain?" I gathered myself up and replied, "No, but
so happy that I cannot live" \[104: 17–18\].

The long, laborious and beneficent after life of this man proved, if
proof was necessary, that his "conversion" was no accidental

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

excitement that might have happened to any man, but an unmistakable mark
of spiritual superiority.

Mr. Finney had, too, to an extraordinary degree, the personal magnetism
that is so characteristic of the class of men to which he belonged. The
effect of his preaching was indescribable, and yet it is doubtful
whether the words uttered had much to do with its exceptional power. His
presence, his touch, the sound of his voice, seemed often sufficient to
arouse unutterable feelings—to uplift and regenerate in what may fairly
be called a miraculous manner.

Not actually having Cosmic Consciousness, he had not the duplex
personality which thereto belongs, and yet he had a feeling of that
other self within himself which upon full illumination would have stood
out as the "I am," while the self conscious man would have taken second
place as "The other I am." As illustrating this inchoate duplex
personality, he says: "Let no man think that those sermons which have
been called so powerful were productions of my own brain or of my own
heart unassisted by the Holy Ghost. They are not mine, but from the Holy
Spirit in me."

Finally it should be noted that the life and the life work of Charles G.
Finney were on strictly parallel lines, though on a less high plane,
with the life and life work of the great religious initiators, he, as
they, expending all his time and energy laboring to place his brothers
and sisters on a higher moral plane than that on which they had
heretofore lived, the only difference being that they worked on a
somewhat higher moral level than that upon which he worked.
