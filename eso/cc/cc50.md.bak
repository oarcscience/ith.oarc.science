### CHAPTER 27.

*W. H. W.*

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> 1842. Entered Cosmic Consciousness
1877, at the age of thirty-five years. Had a very strong and original
mind and a wonderful memory. A gentleman who knew him writes: "He was an
extraordinary conversationalist; it was as if he had absorbed the minds
and works of Darwin, Huxley and Spencer, and spoke with the authority
and knowledge of all three; their works, thought, language, were at his
tongue's end; it was an education to be with him for a few days. He was
a wonderful violinist—the equal of the best not known as a star. He
heard of J. B. \[the J. B. of this volume\] in 1877, sent for him and
had a five hours’ talk with him (he had a capacity of taking in a case,
subject, book, musical composition, what not, and retaining permanently
all he heard or read about it). He asked for another interview, and
after a second talk of two hours said: 'Now, Mr. B., I have done. I have
just one more question to ask you and only one. Have you got what the
scientists might call "a New Prime"?' 'I have,' replied B., 'and I can
further add that you will get it, too. I don't know when, but you will
get it.' J. B. went back to his own city that afternoon. The following
afternoon he received a telegram from W. H. W. 'I have got that Prime.'
I afterwards heard him describe the experience. He said: 'I went into
the yard to the pump, and just as I got there it came—a shock, a flood
of light, and along with, or immediately following, the shock and the
subjective

glow—like a great internal blaze—came the feeling of absolute harmony
with the power that made all things and is in all things. All striving
stopped—there was nothing to strive for—I was at peace.'"
