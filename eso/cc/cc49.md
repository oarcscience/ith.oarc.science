### CHAPTER 26.

*T. S. R.*

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> 1840. Entered Cosmic Consciousness
in 1872, at the age of thirty-two years. Was a member of a Presbyterian
Church in good standing. Upon illumination left the church and has had
no connection with any similar organization since. Was always an
earnest, thoughtful man. "In 1872 \[an informant says\] his friends
thought for a time that he was becoming insane. He passed through a
grave spiritual crisis, the exact nature of which is not known to
me. <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13) Whatever it was, it, to all
appearance,

passed over, and he has been ever since not only sane but exceptionally
intelligent and rightminded. He is the best read Emerson scholar that I
know. In all his home relations—by wife, children and friends—he is
greatly beloved. He has a positive certainty of individual immortality.
He is a very modest man, but has a certain air or manner which impresses
those who meet him that he (being a mere clerk) is a richer man than his
millionaire employers, *and that he knows it*."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[317:\*](cc49.htm#fr_13) Louis Lambert—that is,
Balzac—was supposed by his friends to be insane at the time of
illumination \[5: 126 et seq.\]. Mohammed feared be was becoming insane.
In the case of M. C. L. (infra) the same question came up. This question
has undoubtedly presented itself to the mind of almost every person who
has experienced illumination.
