### CHAPTER 2.

*Jesus the Christ*.

<span class="smallcaps">Balzac</span> says \[5:143\] that Jesus was a
Specialist—that is, that he had Cosmic Consciousness. As Balzac was
himself undoubtedly illumined, he would be high, if not absolute,
authority upon the point. Paul, as soon as his own eyes were opened,
recognized Jesus as belonging to a superior spiritual order—that is, as
having the Cosmic Sense. But let us not take any one's word, but try and
see for ourselves what reasons there are for including this man in the
list of those having Cosmic Consciousness.

##### I.

Jesus was born B.C. 4 \[80\], and would be, according to this authority,
thirty-four or thirty-five years old when he began to

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

teach, so would have been at least thirty-three at the time of
illumination—supposing him a case.

Other writers make him older. Sutherland \[171:140\] says: "The death of
Jesus occurred in the year 35." This would make him thirty-nine at his
death, thirty-six or thirty-eight when he began to teach (the former, if
he taught three years, as John says; the latter, if he taught only one
year, as the synoptics tell us), and, say, thirty-five or thirty-six at
illumination. <span id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)

All goes to show that at about the age specified a marked change took
place in him; that whereas up to a certain age he was

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

very much as others, he all at once ascended to a spiritual level quite
over the heads of ordinary men. Those who knew him at home, as a boy and
a young man, could not understand his superiority. "Is not this the
carpenter's son" \[14: 13: 55\] they ask. Or as elsewhere reported: "Is
not this the carpenter the son of Mary? . . . and they were offended at
him" \[15:6:3\]. This marked spiritual ascent occurring suddenly at this
age is in itself almost diagnostic of the oncoming of the cosmic sense.

The earliest written and probably most authentic account of the
illumination of Jesus runs as follows: "And straightway coming up out of
the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove
descending upon him: and a voice came out of the heavens saying <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Thou
art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased</span>. And straightway
the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness" \[15: 1: 10–12\].
There is a tradition that the illumination of Jesus took place the 6th
or 10th of January \[133a: 63\].

The fact that Jesus went to John to be baptized shows that his mind was
directed to religion and makes it probable that he had (before
illumination) the earnest temperament out of which, when at all, the
Cosmic Sense springs. It is not necessary to suppose that illumination
took place immediately upon the baptism or that there was any special
connection between these two things. The impulse that drove Jesus to
solitude after his illumination is usual, if not universal. Paul felt it
and obeyed it; so did Whitman.

The expression: "He saw the heavens rent asunder," describes well enough
the oncoming of the Cosmic Sense, which is (as has been said)
instantaneous, sudden, and much as if a veil were with one sharp jerk
torn from the eyes of the mind, letting the sight pierce through.

So, describing this same oncoming of Cosmic Consciousness, John Yepes
says (he has been inquiring whether, in this seemingly miraculous
occurrence, it is God or the human soul which acts), and he concludes:
"It is the soul that is moved and awakened; it is as if God drew back
some of the many veils and coverings that are before it, so that it
might see what he is" \[206: 502\].

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

So, too, the sense of the words, "<span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Thou
art my beloved Son</span>," agrees perfectly with the message conveyed
in all the cases. The "I know that the spirit of God is the brother of
my own" of Whitman; and Dante's words: "O love that governest the
heavens, who with thy light didst lift me," being strictly parallel
expressions. The (apparently) objective voice, too, is a common
phenomenon; it was heard by Paul, also by Mohammed.

Another important element in the case is the so-called "Temptation." The
theory here accepted is that Jesus, at the age of thirty-three, or even
thirty-five, was simply an intelligent, very earnest-minded mechanic,
with an excellent heredity and an exceptional physique. That he was in
no way distinguishable, in no way different, save in his eligibility for
spiritual expansion, which was hidden in the depths of his nature even
from himself, and which may equally exist in any of them, from hundreds
of young mechanics in every city and town of Christendom to-day.
Suddenly, instantaneously, the change came, and this young man felt and
knew within himself the seemingly illimitable spiritual force through
the exercise of which almost anything might be accomplished. How was it
to be used? To gain what end? Power? Wealth? Fame? Or what
\[14:4:1–10\]?

Jesus quickly decided, as these men all decide, that the power must be
used for the benefit of the race. Why should he, why should they all,
decide in this sense?

Because the moral elevation, which is a part of Cosmic Consciousness,
will not permit any other decision. Were it not so, were the
intellectual illumination *not* accompanied by moral exaltation, these
men would undoubtedly be in effect so many demons who would end by
destroying the world. This temptation is necessarily common to all the
cases, though they do not all speak of it. The essence of it is the
appeal of the old self conscious self to the new power to assist it in
accomplishing *its* old desires. The devil, therefore, is the self
conscious self. The devil (Mâra) appeared to Gautama as well as to Jesus
\[157: 69\] and urged hint not to launch out on a new path, but to keep
to the old religions practices, to live quietly and comfortably. "What
dost thou want

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

with exertion?" he said to him. Mâra did not seek to allure Gautama with
offers of wealth and power, for these he had already possessed, and even
the self conscious Gautama knew their futility. As already intimated,
every man who enters Cosmic Consciousness necessarily passes through the
same temptation. As all the rest, Bacon was tempted, and, as doubtless
many others have fallen, he, in a sense, fell. He felt in himself such
enormous capacity that he imagined he could absorb the wealth of both
the Cosmic Sense and Self Consciousness—both heaven and earth. Later he
bitterly repented his greed. He acknowledges the gift (from God) of the
divine faculty—"the gracious talent"—which he says he "neither hoarded
up unused, nor did he employ it to the best advantage, as he should have
done, but misspent it in things for which (he) was least fit" \[175:
469\].

The superiority of Jesus to ordinary men consisted (among other things)
in

Intellectual acuteness,

Moral elevation,

An all-embracing optimism,

A sense (or the sense) of immortality.

The mental superiority thus characterized is again almost certainly
confined to those who have passed into Cosmic Consciousness, and
therefore, if granted, would settle the question.

The accounts given in the synoptic gospels of the transfiguration of
Jesus can only be explained (if accepted) by supposing that he was seen
while in the condition of Cosmic Consciousness, the change in appearance
(striking enough in itself) being probably exaggerated (as it would
almost certainly be) in the narration. Here are the accounts as given:
"And he was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,
and his garments became white as the light" \[14: 17: 2\]. "And he was
transfigured before them: and his garments became glistening, exceeding
white; so as no fuller on earth can whiten them" \[15: 9: 2–3\]. It is
singular that this observer should confine his observations to the
*garments* of Jesus. Again: "As he was praying the fashion of his
countenance was altered and his raiment became white and

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

dazzling" \[16: 9: 29\]. It is believed that there is no known human
condition, except that of Cosmic Consciousness, which would justify the
above words. The change in the "raiment" of Jesus spoken of must be
understood as reflected from his face and person.

In the Gospel according to the Hebrews occurs the following passage:
"Just now my mother, the Holy Spirit, took me by one of my hairs and
bore me upon the great mountain of Tabor" \[109: 63\]. Baur and
Hilgenfield, it seems, hold that this is the original of the
transfiguration narrative; but if it is, it does not necessarily weaken
the testimony of Mark and Luke.

There are people living to-day (the writer knows one of them) who have
seen what is described (and well described) in the above words of the
gospels.

Here there are several strong reasons for believing that Jesus had the
Cosmic Sense. A further reason is (if further is needed) that Jesus
stands spiritually at or near the summit of the human race, and if there
is such a faculty as Cosmic Consciousness, as described in this volume,
he must have possessed it, otherwise he could not occupy such a
position.

##### II.

It is most unfortunate that the world possesses no words that we can be
sure this extraordinary man uttered. What a priceless possession would
be a volume, howsoever small, actually written by himself! We have,
however, so many sayings which are attributed to him, and apparently on
such good authority, that we may be pretty certain that many of them
convey with sufficient accuracy the sense of what he actually said.

If, now, Jesus had Cosmic Consciousness, he must have referred to it
over and over again in his teaching, just as all other such men have
done. If he did so, it should be easy for any one who knows about the
Cosmic Sense to detect the references, while for those who do not know
there is such a thing these would necessarily be otherwise interpreted.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

It is not necessary to attribute a *misinterpretation*, since the words
of Jesus (as those of Dante, "Shakespeare" and Whitman) would carry, and
doubtless would be uttered with the intention of carrying, more than one
meaning.

At the same time, as Jesus did not write, and as his words were carried
down by tradition (for some short time at least), and as these words
(according to the present supposition) were imperfectly understood by
those who passed them on, they would inevitably be altered. In some
passages they certainly were, and in many others they probably were.
Phrases, the meaning of which is only partially apprehended, cannot be
carried down verbally intact unless they have already become sacred, as
was the case with the Vedas. The incomplete meaning attributed to them
would inevitably suggest and lead to more or less important changes to
match it.

If, then, Jesus had the Cosmic Sense, and referred to it more or less
often in his teaching, the passages in which he so referred to it would
probably some, if not all, of them be more or less altered. But there is
a long series of passages coming ostensibly directly from him and
running especially through the synoptic gospels, which passages, even in
their present form, seem to refer unmistakably to the faculty now in
question. And if some of them do not so clearly as others, it may be
that such divergence can be fairly accounted for as above. The passages
in question are those treating of what Jesus sometimes called "the
Kingdom of Heaven" and sometimes "the Kingdom of God."

##### III.

The following quotations embrace all the more important and significant
passages in which either expression is used in the gospels when the
words in question are reported as coming from the lips of Jesus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven[\*](cc11.htm#an_103-1.md) \[14:5:3\].

Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness sake for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven [†](cc11.htm#an_104-1.md) \[14:5: 10\].

Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall
teach men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
[‡](cc11.htm#an_104-2.md) but whosoever shall do and teach them he shall be
called great in the *kingdom of heaven*. For I say unto you that except
your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven
\[14:5:19–20\].

But seek ye first his kingdom[§](cc11.htm#an_104-3) (the kingdom of God.md)

\[14: 6: 33\].

Not everyone that saith unto me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven,[║](cc11.htm#an_104-4.md) but he that doeth the will of my Father
which is in heaven \[14:7:23\].

And I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and
shall sit down with Abraham and

Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;[¶](cc11.htm#an_104-5.md) but the
sons of the kingdom shall be cast forth into the outer darkness; there
shall be weeping and the gnashing of teeth \[14: 8:11–12\] .

Verily I say unto you,[\*](cc11.htm#an_104-6.md) among them that are born
of women there hath not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he
that is but little in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. And from
the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence and men of violence take it by force \[14:11: 11–12\].

But if I by the spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of
God[\*](cc11.htm#an_104-7.md) come unto you \[14: 12–28\].

heaven,[†](cc11.htm#an_104-8.md) but to them it is not given \[14: 13:11\].

Consciousness, but the latter almost inevitably leads to the former.

others to do the same, would be called "least," as a conscientious good
man would be called "great" from the point of view of the Cosmic Sense.
But no man could ever enter into Cosmic Consciousness because he had

Cosmic Consciousness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

The kingdom of heaven[‡](cc11.htm#an_105-1.md) is likened unto a man that
sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept his enemy came and
sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away \[14:13:24\]. The
kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed which a man took
and sowed in his field; which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it
is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the
birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof \[14: 13:
31–2\] .

The kingdom of heaven[§](cc11.htm#an_105-2.md) is like unto leaven, which a
woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened
\[14: 13: 33\].

The kingdom of heaven[║](cc11.htm#an_105-3.md) is like unto a treasure
hidden in the field; which a man found and hid; and in his joy he goeth
and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field \[14: 13: 44\] .

The kingdom of heaven[¶](cc11.htm#an_105-4.md) is like unto a man that is a
merchant seeking goodly pearls; and having found one pearl of great
price he went and sold all he had and bought it.

Again, the kingdom of heaven [\*\*](cc11.htm#an_105-5.md) is like unto a
net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind; which when it
was filled they drew up on the beach and they sat down and gathered the
good into vessels but the bad they cast away \[14:13:45–47\].

I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven;[\*](cc11.htm#an_105-6.md) and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven \[14:16:19\].

In that hour came the [disciples](errata.htm#2.md) unto
Jesus,[\*](cc11.htm#an_105-7.md) saying: Who, then, is greatest in the
kingdom of heaven? And he called to him a little child and said: Verily
I say unto you: except ye turn and become as little children ye shall in
no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven \[14: 18: 1\] .

Therefore is the kingdom of heaven[\*](cc11.htm#an_105-8.md) likened unto a
certain king which

the merely self conscious mind and the final inevitable subjection of
the latter to the former. A perfect image of the initial apparent
insignificancy of the Cosmic Sense as it exists in one or a few obscure
individuals, and of its ultimate overwhelming preponderance in view both
of the universal influence of the teaching of these (say Gautama, Jesus,
Paul and Mohammed), and more especially in view of the inevitable
universality of the Cosmic Sense in the future.

<span id="an_105-2">§</span> If possible a still more exact simile—the
Cosmic Sense leavens the individual, and is to-day leavening the world.

<span id="an_105-3">║</span> Men who have the Cosmic Sense give up

<span id="an_105-4">¶</span> The same statement in other language.

and tares.

<span id="an_105-6">\*</span> The Cosmic Sense is the final arbiter of
good and ill. Jesus seems to have looked forward to the establishment of
a school or sect the members of which should possess the Cosmic Sense.

but in the end the cosmic conscious mind will utterly wipe from off the
earth and replace the merely self conscious mind.

Meanwhile, men on the self conscious plane are greatly wanting in
patience and mercy.

would make a reckoning with his servants. And when he had begun to
reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents. But
for as much as he had not wherewith to pay, his Lord commanded him to be
sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be

made. The servant, therefore, fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord
have patience with me and I will pay thee all. And the Lord of that
servant being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the
debt. But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants
which owed him a hundred pence, and he laid hold on him and took him by
the throat, saying: Pay what thou owest. So his fellow servant fell down
and besought him saying: Have patience with me and I will pay thee. And
he would not; but went and cast him into prison until he should pay that
which was due. So when his fellow servants saw what was done they were
exceeding sorry and came and told unto their Lord all that was done.
Then his Lord called him unto him and saith unto him: Thou wicked
servant, I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me:
Shouldst not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow servant even as I
had mercy on thee? And his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the
tormentors till he should pay all that was due \[14: 18: 23–34\] .

needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God

The kingdom of heaven[†](cc11.htm#an_106-2.md) is like unto a man that is a
householder, which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into
his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day
he sent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and
saw others standing in the market-place idle; and to them he said: Go ye
also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they
went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour
and did likewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out and found
others standing: And he saith unto them: Why stand ye here all the day
idle? They say unto him: Because no man hath hired us.

He saith unto them: Go ye also into the vineyard. And when even was come
the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward: Call the laborers and
give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when
they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every
man a penny. And when the first came, they supposed they would receive
more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And when they
received it, they murmured against the householder, saying: These last
have spent but one hour,

Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
Take up that which is thine, and go thy way: it is my will to give unto
this last even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will
with mine own? or is thine eye evil, because I am good? So the last
shall be first and the first last \[14:20:1–15\].[\*](cc11.htm#an_107-1.md)

A man had two sons; and he came to the first and said: Son, go work
today in the vineyard. And he answered and said: I will not; but
afterwards he repented himself and went. And he came to the second, and
said likewise. And he answered and said: I go, sir, and went not.
Whether of the twain did the will of his father? They say the first.

And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying: the
kingdom of heaven [†](cc11.htm#an_107-3.md) is likened unto a certain king
which made a marriage feast for his son, and sent forth his servant to
call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not
come. Again he sent forth other servants, saying: Tell them that are
bidden: Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are
killed, and all things are ready: Come to the marriage feast. But they
made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to
his merchandise; and the rest laid hold on his servants and entreated
them shamefully, and killed them. But the king was wroth; and he sent
his armies and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. Then
saith he to his servants: The wedding is ready, but they that were
bidden were not worthy. Go ye therefore into the partings of the
highways, and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage feast. And
those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as
many as they

<span id="an_107-1">\*</span> By their answer the chief priests and
elders condemned themselves, for they said: "I go, sir," and went not,
while the publicans and harlots professed nothing, but, as shown
elsewhere in the gospel, sometimes had excellent hearts. They may be
easily nearer Cosmic Consciousness than the self-righteous upper class.
Where, indeed, is a case of a self-righteous man becoming illumined?

<span id="an_107-2">\*</span> The Cosmic Sense comes especially to those
people who have the highest moral nature.

<span id="an_107-3">†</span> The king is God, the marriage feast is
Cosmic Consciousness, those who are bidden are those who have been given
the best opportunities for spiritual advancement—plenty, leisure,
etc.—but instead of using these for the purpose designed (spiritual
growth) they became absorbed in them alone. Then God sent his prophets
to persuade them that they were making a mistake, but they would not
listen, and even misused the prophets. So when the well-off and the
educated and the religious would not come the invitation was extended to
all. But rich or poor, learned or ignorant, religious or outcast,
whoever comes, must have on a wedding garment—the mind must be clothed
in humility, sincerity, reverence, candor and fearlessness. Could a man
secure access to the feast without these it is easily imaginable that he
would be torn to pieces.

found both bad and good: And the wedding was filled with guests. But
when the king came in to behold the guests he saw there a man who had
not on a wedding garment, and he said unto him: Friend, how tamest thou
in thither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless. Then the
king said to the servants: Bind him hand and foot and cast him out into
the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
For many are called but few chosen \[14:22:1–14\].

But woe unto you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because ye shut the
kingdom of heaven[\*](cc11.htm#an_108-1.md) against men: For ye enter not
in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering in to enter
\[14:23:13\].

Then shall the kingdom of heaven[†](cc11.htm#an_108-2.md) be likened unto
ten virgins, which took their lamps and went forth to meet the
bridegroom. And five of them were foolish and five were wise. For the
foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them; but the wise
took oil in their vessels with their lamps. Now, while the bridegroom
tarried, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there is a cry:
Behold the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him. Then all those virgins
arose and trimmed their lamps. And the foolish said unto the wise: Give
us of your oil; for our lamps are going out. But the wise answered,
saying: Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: Go ye
rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves. And while they went
away to buy the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with
him to the marriage feast: And the door was shut. Afterwards came also
the other virgins, saying: Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered and
said: Verily I say unto you, I know you not. Watch, therefore, ye know
not the day nor the hour \[14:25:1–12\].

For it \[the kingdom of God[\*](cc11.htm#an_108-3.md)\] is as when a man,
going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto
them his goods. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to
another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on
his journey. Straightway he that received the five talents went and
traded with them, and made other five talents. In like manner he also
that received the two gained other two. But he that received the one
went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.

<span id="an_108-1">\*</span> The formal, soulless religion of the
scribes and Pharisees (and the same is true of much of the Christianity
of to-day) was antagonistic to the growth of the spirit to Cosmic
Consciousness. Neither would they allow (in as far as they could
prevent) of any spiritual life and growth outside the narrow limits laid
down by their "law."

<span id="an_108-2">†</span> The Cosmic Sense does not come to the
careless but to the earnest, who diligently use all means of spiritual
advancement. The virgins *all* slumbered; *none* of them knew that "the
bridegroom" was coming, but some had taken the necessary means—the
others had not.

<span id="an_108-3">\*</span> Man is endowed with Self Consciousness,
and must make the most possible of it before he can rise above it. Or in
other words, and to convert the proposition into a truism, man must
reach the top of the mental stratum called Self Consciousness before he
can pass into the superimposed stratum called Cosmic Consciousness.
Jesus, in the parable, says: God has given to each man the self
conscious faculties in varying measure, whether he (any given
individual) shall pass beyond Self Consciousness into the kingdom of
heaven (Cosmic Consciousness) depends not so much upon the measure of
these faculties as upon the use made of them. That there is much truth
in this proposition <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> is certain. If, on
the other hand, the cultivation of these faculties is neglected the man
remains hopelessly on the self conscious plane; *there* has been, is and
always will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now after a long
time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with
them. And he that received the five talents came and brought other five
talents, saying: Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have
gained other five talents. His lord said unto him: Well done, good and
faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set
thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. And he also
that received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst unto
me two talents; lo, I have gained other two talents. His lord said unto
him: Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over
a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy
of thy lord. And he also that had received the one talent came and said:
Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not
sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter: And I was afraid, and
went away and hid thy talent in the earth; lo, thou hast thine own. But
his lord answered and said unto him: Thou wicked and slothful servant,
thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not
scatter; thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers,
and at my coming I should have received mine own with interest. Take ye
away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the
ten talents. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath
shall be taken away. And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the
outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth \[14:25:
14–30\].

And he said: So is the kingdom of God[\*](cc11.htm#an_109-1.md) as if a man
should east seed upon the earth, and should sleep and rise night and
day, and the seed should spring up and grow he knoweth not how
\[15:4:26–7\].

And he said unto them: Verily I say unto you there be some here of them
that stand by which shall in no wise taste of death until they see the
kingdom of God[†](cc11.htm#an_109-2.md) come with power \[15:9:1\].

And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: It is good for thee
to enter into the kingdom of God[‡](cc11.htm#an_109-3.md) with one eye,
rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; where their worm dieth
not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted with
fire \[15:9:47\].

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_109-1">\*</span> The seed (a life of aspiration) must be
sown. We do not know what is to grow from it—days and nights pass and at
some instant—in bed, walking, driving, 'the guest that has waited long"
appears. See above same parable from Matthew.

<span id="an_109-2">†</span> There be some here present who shall enter
into Cosmic Consciousness. To a man with Cosmic Consciousness it seems
so simple and certain that others will enter it. "I bestow upon any man
or woman (says Whitman) the entrance to all the gifts of the universe"

<span id="an_109-3">‡</span> Allow nothing to stand in the way of
spiritual advancement. Anything is better than to remain in the merely
self conscious state, which is full of miseries.

The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the gospel of
the kingdom of God[§](cc11.htm#an_110-1.md) is preached and every man
entereth violently into it \[16: 16: 16\].

And being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of
God[║](cc11.htm#an_110-2.md) cometh he answered them and said: The kingdom
of God Cometh not with observation; neither shall they say, Lo, here! or
there, for lo, the kingdom of God is within you \[16: 17:20–1\].

He said unto them, Verily I say unto you: There is no man that hath left
house, or wife or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of
God's[¶](cc11.htm#an_110-3.md) sake, who shall not receive manifold more in
this time, and in the world to come eternal life \[16: 18: 29–30\].

Jesus answered and said unto him: Verily, verily I say unto thee, except
a man be born anew he cannot see the Kingdom of
God.[\*\*](cc11.htm#an_110-4.md) Nicodemus saith unto Him: How can a man be
born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb
and be born? Jesus answered: Verily, verily I say unto thee, except a
man be born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God \[17:3:3–5\].

Looked at from the present point of view, the objects of the teachings
of Jesus, as of Gautama, were two: (*a*) To tell men what he had learned
upon entering into Cosmic Consciousness, which things he saw it was of
the very greatest importance that they should know; and (*b*) to lead
men up into or at least towards Cosmic Consciousness, or, in his words,
into the kingdom of God.

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_110-1">§</span> Tries to enter violently or awkwardly into
it. Tries to get in while still only self conscious. How true is this
to-day!

<span id="an_110-2">║</span> It is not outside but inside. It is a part
(a faculty) of the mind itself.

<span id="an_110-3">¶</span> Men with Cosmic Consciousness have
generally been of this opinion, have often parted from their relations,
and have either not married or have broken the tie—cf. Buddha, Jesus,
Paul, Balzac (until the very end of his life), Whitman, Carpenter.

<span id="an_110-4">\*\*</span> This passage does not seem to need
comment. It is, as it stands, as clear as words can be. The oncoming of
the Cosmic Sense is a new birth into a new life.

</div>

#### SUMMARY

We have in this case:

*a*. Some evidence of the characteristic suddenness that belongs to the
oncoming of the new sense.

*b*. No definite record of subjective light, though it is impossible

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

to say what the words "Heaven rent asunder," "Spirit as a dove
descending," and "A voice out of the heavens" really mean. As the
experience was subjective, Jesus must have told some one of it, and
perhaps it passed through several minds before the words we have were
written down, no one (not even Jesus) having any idea as to the meaning
of the experience.

*c*. Presumably we have intellectual illumination.

*d*. Moral elevation well marked, though unfortunately we know nothing
for certain of the personality of Jesus before the time of his
illumination, when, as above stated, he was about thirty-three or
thirty-five years of age.

*e*. We have the sense of immortality and the extinction of the sense of
sin and of the fear of death.

*f*. Finally, the characteristic change of appearance which accompanies
the presence of the Cosmic Sense and spoken of by the synoptics as
Jesus’"transfiguration."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[98:\*](cc11.htm#fr_3.md) The *Review of Reviews*
for January, 1897, sums up the evidence bearing on the point as follows:

"One of the most eminent of living authorities on the life of Christ,
Dr. Cunningham Geikie, writes in the Homiletic Review on the various
attempts to fix the exact date of the birth of the Messiah.

"It is clear that the received chronology of the Abbot Dyonisius the
Dwarf, which dates from the first half of the sixth century, must have
begun several years too late in fixing the birth of Christ as having
taken place in the 754th year of Rome, since it is known that Herod died
in 750, and Jesus must have been born while Herod was still reigning.
Dr. Geikie points out other fundamental errors in the calculations of
the Abbot Dyonisius.

"Dyonisius had based his calculations on the mention by St. Luke that
John the Baptist, who was a little older than Jesus, began his public
work in the fifteenth year of Tiberius, and that Jesus was 'about thirty
years old' when he began to teach (Luke iii: 1–23) . This fifteenth year
of Tiberius would be perhaps 782 or 783, and thirty deducted from this
would give 752 or 753, to the latter of which Dionysius added a year, on
the supposition that Luke's expression, 'about thirty years,' required
him to add a year. But the vague about was a weak ground on which to go,
and, besides, the reign of Tiberius may be reckoned from his association
in the government with Augustus, and thus from 765 instead of from 767.
The texts I have quoted from St. Luke cannot, therefore, be used to fix
either the birthday or the month of the birth, or even the year. This is
seen, indeed, in the varying opinions on all these points in the early
church, and from the fact that the 25th of December has been accepted as
the birth day only since the fourth century, when it spread from Rome,
as that which was to be thus honored."

THE MOST REASONABLE CONCLUSION.

"The nearest approach to a sound conclusion is, in fact, supplied by the
statement that Herod was alive for some time after Christ was born. The
infant Redeemer must have been six weeks old when presented in the
temple, and the visit of the Magi fell we do not know how much later.
That the massacre of all the children at Bethlehem from two years old
and under presupposes that the Magi must have come to Jerusalem a long
time after the birth of the expected King, for there would have been no
sense in killing children two years old if Christ had been born only a
few weeks or even months before. That there was a massacre, as told in
the Gospel, is confirmed by a reference to it in a Satire of Macrobius
(Sat. ii, 4), so that the crime is historically true and the higher
criticism which treated it as a fable is convicted of error. But if
Christ was born two years before Herod's death—and He may have been born
even earlier—this would make the great event fall in the year 748, or
six years before our era."

If we accept the conclusions of this writer, Jesus was about thirty-five
years of age at illumination.
