<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Born</span> 1840. Entered Cosmic Consciousness in 1872, at the age of thirty-two years. Was a member of a Presbyterian Church in good standing.

In all his home relations&#8212;by wife, children and friends&#8212;he is greatly beloved. He has a positive certainty of individual immortality. He is a very modest man, but has a certain air or manner which impresses those who meet him that he (being a mere clerk) is a richer man than his millionaire employers, <i>and that he knows it</i>."</p>
