### CHAPTER 17.

*J. B. B.*

J. B. B., Doctor of Medicine, born 1817. Entered into Cosmic
Consciousness 1855, at the age of thirty-eight years. An informant says
of him: "He is not a refined man," and he goes on: "It is one of the
strange things in this whole matter that the attainment of the truth
seems to leave a man in this respect about as it finds him. Dr. B. was
an example. He seemed content to live in a cheap, bare house, and he
rather courted coarseness in dress, talk and life." As regards
coarseness in dress, food and surroundings, our informant need not have
looked upon J. B. B. as so exceptional. He might have compared him with
Tilleinathan Swamy \[56: 142\], with Edward Carpenter, or even with
Jesus, Mohammed or Walt Whitman. "At the same time," our informant
continues, "touch him on the subject of the inner vision and he was
alive to the core. He had been a spiritualist, but after illumination,
while seeming to know that much that spiritualism taught was true, its
importance was dwarfed by the much greater truths to which he had
access." "He once told me," the informant continues, "a curious thing:
He said he died, his spirit left his body for twenty minutes, and he
looked at, hovered over, and finally went back into it. He told this in
a grave, convincing way,

which caused in the hearer a gruesome feeling. No one who heard him tell
it could help believing it."
