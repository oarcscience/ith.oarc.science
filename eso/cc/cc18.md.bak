*Cosmic Consciousness*, by Richard Maurice Bucke, \[1901\], at

### CHAPTER 9.

*Francis Bacon*.

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> 1561.; died 1626.

Nothing approaching to an exhaustive study of this case can be attempted
here. The mere flanges of the subject have filled a moderate-sized

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

library, while the core of the matter has hardly been touched upon.

##### I.

Without more ado or any beating about the bush it may as well be frankly
stated at once that the view of the present editor is:

*a*. That Francis Bacon wrote the "Shakespeare" plays and poems.

*b*. That he entered into Cosmic Consciousness at about the age of
thirty, or perhaps a year earlier, as his intellectual and moral
development was very precocious.

*c*. That he began writing the "Sonnets" immediately after his
illumination. The "Sonnets," as considered here, are the first one
hundred and twenty-six, which distinctly constitute a poem in and by
themselves and deal with the subject here considered.

*d*. That the earlier of these one hundred and twenty-six "Sonnets" are
addressed to the Cosmic Sense, and the later to it and its offspring,
the plays.

*e*. That in the "Sonnets" the following individualities may be
recognized: (a) the Cosmic Sense; (b) the Bacon of the Cosmic Sense, and
of the plays and "Sonnets";. (c) the special offspring of the Cosmic
Sense—the plays; (d) the ostensible Bacon of the court, politics, prose
writings, business, etc., and possibly others.

##### II.

It is not absolutely denied that the first one hundred and twenty-six
"Sonnets" can be read as if addressed to a young male friend (although
in the case of several this might be, it seems to the writer,
successfully disputed), but it is clear that so read they lack meaning
and dignity—that, in fact, looked at from this point of view, they are
entirely unworthy of the man (whoever he was) who wrote "Lear" and
"Macbeth." And it may be claimed that an almost (or quite) constant
characteristic of the writings of the class of men dealt with in this
volume is exactly this double

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

meaning corresponding with the duplex personality of the writer. Of this
double, often triple, meaning the works of Dante and Whitman supply
perhaps the best examples.

T. S. Baynes \[86: 764\] says that these speculations "cannot be
regarded as successful"; but let us, for the sake of argument, suppose
that there really was such a young man, such a dark woman \[Mary Fitton,
167: 30 et seq. or another\], that would prove absolutely nothing. These
people might have had a real existence and might have been spoken to and
spoken of as the superficial meaning of the "Sonnets," just as the ocean
is spoken to and of in the superficial meaning of "With Husky Haughty
Lips" \[193: 392\]. Or take for another example the "Prayer of Columbus"
\[193: 323\]. Columbus might have made just such a prayer, and there is
no reason why Whitman should not have put such a prayer into his mouth;
but nothing is more certain than that the words in question are
addressed to the All Powerful by Whitman himself. But why select
instances? There is perhaps not a line in the "Leaves" which has one
meaning only. Then who to-day does not understand that in the "Divine
Comedy" Dante used the theological terms current in his day to veil and
express far deeper and loftier thoughts than had theretofore ever been
annexed to them? Attach the current signification to the terms used and
his verses had one meaning, but ascribe to these terms his intention and
they have another vastly wider and deeper. So his last and best
translator, who undoubtedly knew him profoundly, says that "a far
deeper-lying and more-prevailing source of imperfect comprehension of
the poem than any verbal difficulty exists in the double or triple
meaning that runs through it" \[70:16\]. Or is "Seraphita" a sort of
fairy tale having for central figure an idealized hysterico-maniacal
Norwegian girl'?

##### III.

That a man having Cosmic Consciousness is, in fact, at least a dual
person is abundantly shown and illustrated in the present volume. and
"Shakespeare," the author of the plays and "Sonnets,"

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

is really another (while the same) self of the Bacon who wrote the prose
works, spoke in Parliament, lived before the world as jurist, courtier
and citizen. Just as "Seraphita" (Seraphitus), while being Balzac, is
totally distinct from the ostensible Balzac who was seen in Parisian
drawing rooms. Just as the Whitman of the "Leaves" is wholly distinct
(yet the same) from the Whitman who rode on omnibusses and ferries,
"lived the same life with the rest," and died in Camden, March 26, 1892.
Just as "Gabriel," while being Mohammed, is at the same time another and
distinct personality.

This identity (at the same time) and disparateness is the true solution
(it is believed) of the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy.

##### IV.

It is perhaps impossible for the merely self conscious man to form any
conception of what this oncoming of Cosmic Consciousness must be to
those who experience it. The man is lifted out of his old self and lives
rather in heaven than upon the old earth—more correctly the old earth
becomes heaven. One of the prime necessities of this period is solitude.
Why? Probably because the person is so occupied with, so enraptured by,
his new world (his new self), that he simply cannot bear to be called
back to the old world (the old self). So Balzac would (at this period of
his life) shut himself up—hide himself—for weeks and months at a
stretch. So Paul conferred not with flesh and blood, "neither went up to
Jerusalem" \[22:1–17\], but "away into Arabia," and seems to have lived
very much to himself for some time. Solitude (although naturally he was
so eminently sociable) became, under the same circumstances, a necessity
to Whitman, and in the early part of his Cosmic Conscious life he would
frequently spend days, weeks and even months at a stretch in the
sparsely peopled or uninhabited districts of Long Island—especially
along the seashore.

Immediately upon the illumination of Jesus (if we can depend upon the
account given in Matthew and Mark) he was "led up of

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the spirit into the wilderness," and remained in solitude for a certain
time. And it is probable that sufficient research would reveal action of
this kind as universal in pronounced cases. Be this as it may, Spedding
\[174: 49\] says that: "From April, 1590, until the latter part of 1591
\[nearly two years\] I find no other composition of Bacon's \[than a
letter of five pages!\] nor any important piece of news concerning him."
While (referring to the very same period in his life) Bacon says,
writing to Burghley late in 1591 or early in 1592, when he was
thirty-one years old, and, according to the hypothesis, one to two years
after his illumination: "I do not fear that action shall impair it \[his
health\], because I account my ordinary course of study and meditation
to be more painful \[more laborious\] than most parts of action are"
\[174: 56\].

Then again it seems that, especially during these two years, 1590 and
1591, Bacon frequently, to use his own words, "fled into the shade" at
Twickenham and "enjoyed the blessings of contemplation in that sweet
solitariness which collecteth the mind as shutting the eyes doth the
sight" \[129: 71\]. So "there are times noted by Mr. Spedding when Bacon
wrote with closed doors, and when the subject of his studies is
doubtful; and there is one long vacation of which the same careful
biographer remarks that he cannot tell what work the indefatigable
student produced during those months, for that he knows of none whose
date corresponds with the period" \[129: 71–2\]. And doubtless Mrs. Pott
is in the right when she suggests that it was during such periods and
probably during 1590–91 that many of the early plays were written \[129:
71\].

##### V.

Thus we have the frame into which to set the picture: Bacon's mind is
exceedingly precocious and he enters Cosmic Consciousness, let us
suppose, early in 1590, at or shortly after the age of twenty-nine; he
had probably written several plays before that, a few of which may have
been thought worthy of inclusion in the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

1623 folio. In the spring of 1590 (in his thirtieth year) he acquires
the Cosmic Sense. For the next two years (1590–91) he is much secluded
and produces a number of plays, while, as a sort of running commentary
upon his mental experiences and his work, he wrote the earlier
"Sonnets," the rest being written one or two at a time as occasion
called them forth, between this period and the date of their
publication-1609.

It would be proper in this place to give some account of Bacon's
personality were it not that the subject is too large for the limits of
this volume. The question which concerns us here is, of course: were his
intellect and moral nature (especially the latter) such as belong to
persons having Cosmic Consciousness 2 Upon the answers to the last half
of this question a doubt (fostered chiefly by Pope and Macaulay) has
arisen. The point cannot be argued here. All that can be said is that
the present writer believes that Bacon was as great morally as he was
intellectually; and he believes that whoever will take the pains to
seriously consider the standard works on the subject written by able and
impartial men (such as Dixon's "Personal History" \[75\], Spedding's
"Life and Times" \[174\], Spedding's "Evenings with a Reviewer" \[177\],
and especially the "Life," by Rawley, who knew Bacon well) will
inevitably come to the same conclusion. Rawley says of him: "He was free
from malice; he was no revenger of injuries; he was no defamer of any
man; but would always say the best that could be said of any person,
even an enemy" \[141: 52\]. And after many years’ study of the subject
Spedding sums up as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

The evidence which everybody had to judge from led me to suppose him a
very different person from what he was commonly taken for. That idea led
me to seek for further evidence, and all the further evidence which I
discovered confirmed the impression. I do not find fault with people for
not knowing what advice Bacon gave the king about calling a parliament
and dealing with it; but I say that the tenor of the advice, being now
produced, shows that they were very bad guessers; that the inference
they drew as to Bacon's character from the very abundant evidence which
they had before them was strangely inaccurate; as far from the truth as
if one should hold up Flavius as an example of a bad steward, because
the economy was bad of the house in

</div>

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

which he served. I take these newly discovered pieces as tests. If I had
been wrong, they would have convicted me; if Macaulay had been right,
they would have confirmed him \[178: 189\].

</div>

And then, at the end of his book, after all the facts of Bacon's life
that have come down to us had been reviewed and considered he goes on:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

For myself at least, much as one must grieve over such a fall of such a
man, and so forlorn a close of such a life, I have always felt that had
he not fallen, or had he fallen upon a fortune less desolate in its
outward conditions, I should never have known how good and how great a
man he really was—hardly, perhaps, how great and how invincible a thing
intrinsic goodness is. Turning from the world without to the world which
was within him, I know nothing more inspiring, more affecting, more
sublime, than the undaunted energy, the hopefulness, trustfulness,
clearness, patience, and composure, with which his spirit sustained
itself under that most depressing fortune. The heart of Job himself was
not so sorely tried, nor did it pass the trial better. Through the many
volumes which he produced during these five years, I find no idle
repining, no vain complaint of others, no weak justification of himself;
no trace of a disgusted, a despairing or a faltering mind \[178:407\].

</div>

Compare with this estimate of Bacon's mental attitude under the
depressing circumstances of his last years the undying and inexhaustible
cheer of Walt Whitman, Jacob Behmen, and William Blake in like case.

##### VI.

Here (while speaking of the personal traits of this man) will be as good
an opportunity as any to quote a few passages which seem to glance at
some certain quality in Bacon's mind such as this master faculty of
which there is question in this book. For instance, Rawley \[141:47\],
as a result of personal observation, says of him: "I have been induced
to think that if there were a beam of knowledge derived from God upon
any man in these modern times, it was upon him. For though he was a
great reader of books, yet he had not his knowledge from books, but from
some grounds and notions from within himself; which, notwithstanding,

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

he vented with great caution and circumspection." In other words, Hawley
thinks that Bacon was inspired, and says that he was exceedingly careful
in publishing the truths or ideas derived from that source. And this is
exactly what is claimed by the present editor as one reason for the
concealed authorship of the plays and sonnets.

Note again these words of Bacon's, taken from his essay "Of Truth"
\[35:82\]: "The first creature of God, in the works of the days, was the
light of the sense; the last was the light of reason; and his Sabbath
work ever since is the illumination of his spirit." In other words: In
the evolution of the human mind simple consciousness was first produced;
then self consciousness; and lastly, there is being produced to-day
Cosmic Consciousness. Bacon proceeds: "First he breathed light upon the
face of the matter of chaos \[and produced life, simple consciousness\];
then he breathed light into the face of man \[and produced self
consciousness\]; and still he breatheth and inspireth light into the
face of his chosen" \[endowing them with Cosmic Consciousness\].
Compare: "It has been said, great are the senses, greater than the
senses is the mind \[simple consciousness\], greater than the mind is
the understanding \[self consciousness\]. What is greater than the
understanding is that \[Cosmic Consciousness\]. Thus knowing that which
is higher than the understanding and restraining yourself by yourself
\[note the inevitable reduplication of the individual\], destroy the
unmanageable enemy in the shape of desire" \[154: 57\]. And again: "It
is not by reasoning that the law is to be found, it is beyond the pale
of reasoning" \[164: 39\].

It is worthy of notice that Bacon seems to have recognized an interval
between the light of reason and the illumination of the spirit as great
as the interval between the light of sense and that of reason. That is,
he recognized as great an interval between Cosmic and Self Consciousness
as exists between the latter and simple consciousness—just as is claimed
by the present writer. But within the field of self consciousness where
could he find such an interval as this between reason and anything above
reason?

Again in his great prayer \[175: 469\] Bacon says:

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

I am a debtor to Thee for the gracious talent[\*](cc18.htm#an_161-1.md) of
Thy gifts and graces, which I have neither put into a napkin, nor put it
(as I ought) to exchangers, where it might have made best profit; but
misspent it in things for which I was least fit; so as I may truly say,
my soul hath been a stranger in the course of my pilgrimage.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_161-1">\*</span> The talent in question is the Cosmic
Sense. He did not let it lie idle, but he did not make as much use of it
as he might and ought to have done. He should have lived his life for it
(as Gautama, Jesus and Paul did) whereas he tried to live (did live) two
lives and misspent a large part of his life "in things for which he was
least fit"—law, politics, etc.; so it may be truly said his soul (the
Bacon of the Cosmic Sense) was a stranger in the life of the ostensible
(the self conscious) Bacon.

</div>

The Cosmic Sense produced the plays. If Bacon had openly lived his whole
life for the Cosmic Sense what other perhaps greater works might he not
have produced? And instead of his almost hidden, misunderstood life, we
might have had another of those open, exalted lives, each one of which
is a source of endless inspiration to the race which is slowly toiling
up from what we see around us to that divine goal.

To close this part of the subject, glance at two other short extracts.
The first from the "Plan of the Work," the second from the "Novum
Organum." Bacon says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

If we labor in thy works with the sweat of our
brows[\*](cc18.htm#an_161-2.md) thou wilt make us partakers of thy vision
and thy Sabbath. Humbly we pray that this mind may be steadfast in us,
and that through these our hands, and the hands of others to whom thou
shalt give the same spirit, thou wilt vouchsafe to endow the human
family with new mercies \[34:54\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_161-2">\*</span> This passage seems plainly to allude to a
higher spiritual life, which may be attained to in this life, and of
which it may be supposed the writer had had experience.

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

I may say then of myself that which one said in jest (since it marks the
distinction so truly): "It cannot be that we should think alike, when
one drinks water and the other drinks wine." Now, other men, as well in
ancient as in modern times, have in the matter of sciences drunk a crude
liquor like water, either flowing spontaneously from the understanding,
or drawn up by logic, as by wheels from a well. Whereas I pledge mankind
in a liquor strained from countless grapes,[\*](cc18.htm#an_161-3.md) from
grapes ripe and fully seasoned, collected in clusters, and gathered, and
then squeezed in the press, and finally purified and clarified in the
vat. And therefore it is no wonder if they and I do not think alike
\[34:155\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_161-3">\*</span> If the "liquor strained from countless
grapes" is not the Cosmic Sense it does not seem very clear what it is.

</div>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

##### VII.

This, of course, is not the place for a discussion of the authorship of
the plays, but since it is here taken as certain that they are to be
credited to Bacon, it will be right to give a few of the principal
reasons for the adoption of that view. The testimony of the writer
himself on the point will be produced when certain of the "Sonnets" fall
under consideration. Exclusive of these passages in the "Sonnets" the
"reasons" in question may be summed up as follows:

*a*. The large number of new words in the plays, estimated at five
hundred, mostly from the Latin, and the much larger number of old words
used in a new sense, estimated at five thousand, make it clear that
these were written not merely by a genius but by a learned man—a man who
read Latin so continuously as that he came almost to think in that
language. Then the similarity of Bacon's style to that of the plays, and
above all the striking identity of the vocabulary in the prose works and
plays, so marvelous that 98.5 per cent. of "Shakespeare's" words are
also Bacon's \[37: 133\], the use of the same metaphors and similes, of
the same antitheta, etc. \[37:136\], makes it nearly certain (especially
when it is borne in mind that that vocabulary, those metaphors, similes
and antitheta are largely new) that the same mind produced both sets of
books—the "Shakespearean" and Baconian.

*b*. Not only are there great numbers of new words and old words with
new meanings, metaphors, similes, etc., common to the "Shakespeare"
plays and to the Baconian prose, but the large number of phrases and
turns of expression which are also found in both cannot possibly be
attributed to accident. See these given by the hundred by Donnelly
\[74\], by Wigston \[197\], by Holmes \[99\] and others.

*c*. Bacon and "Shakespeare" read the same books, and not only so, but
the favorite books of the one were the favorite books of the other.

*d*. They write on the same subjects. The philosophy of the

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "De Augmentis,"
the "Novum Organum" and other prose works is constantly being reproduced
in the plays; while Bacon's essays and the plays treat throughout the
same subjects (human life and human passions) and *always from the same
point of view* \[197: 25 et seq.\]

*e*. On all sorts of subjects, large and small, their point of view is
the same—they never express irreconcilable opinions.

*f*. They were (if two) the two greatest men living in the world at that
time. For thirty years they lived in what we to-day should consider a
small city of one hundred and sixty thousand inhabitants \[82: 820\].
And it does not appear that they ever met, and there is no evidence that
either of them ever knew of the existence of the other. The lesser man
of the (supposed) two—Baconleft behind him abundant evidence of the
literary activity of his life in the form of manuscripts, letters to and
from friends, etc. The greater "Shakespeare"—left none; not a
manuscript, not a letter.

*g*. The localities of the plays are all such as are known to have been
known to Bacon either by residence, visiting or reading—largely the two
former. With these localities the writer frequently evinces an intimate
familiarity. The one especial locality which must have been minutely
known to William Shakespeare—Stratford and its neighborhood—is not
introduced.

*h*. There exists a distinct parallelism between the successive plays
(their incidents, scenes, etc.) and the occurrences of Bacon's life (his
position, circumstances, residences, etc.), while there seems none
between them and "Shakespeare's" life, so far as this is known to us
\[130\]. .

*i*. The relation existing between "Shakespeare's" "Richard III" and his
"Henry the VIII" on the one hand and Bacon's prose history of Henry the
VII on the other makes it about certain that the same man wrote the
three works \[197: 1–24\].

*j*. It is sometimes said that Bacon was a scientist, a philosopher, a
courtier, a lawyer, a man of affairs, but not a great wit or poet, such
as might have written the plays. But, in the first place, and putting
aside the plays, Bacon was both a wit and a

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

poet. Macaulay does not exaggerate when he writes that, as shown in his
prose works: "The poetical faculty was powerful in Bacon's mind, but
not, like his wit, so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his
reason and to tyrannize over the whole man." "No imagination," he adds,
"was ever at once so strong and so thoroughly subjugated" \[120: 487\].

*k*. The "Promus" argument would alone seem, to an impartial mind,
pretty conclusive of the Baconian authorship of the plays. If this
collection \[129\] was not made to aid in the production of these, will
some one kindly tell us with what end Bacon undertook and prosecuted the
labor of its compilation? Those who have still doubts upon the subject
would do well to read Bacon's openly acknowledged writings. Then, in the
second place, it is claimed here that Bacon was really two men (the self
conscious Bacon and the Cosmic Conscious Bacon); that the man seen by
Bacon's contemporaries and in the prose works was the former, while the
concealed man who produced the plays and "Sonnets" was the latter. The
Cosmic Conscious Bacon had (of course) the use of all the learning and
of all the faculties of the self conscious Bacon, and along with these
the vast spiritual insight and powers which go with possession of Cosmic
Consciousness.

*l*. About April 18th, 1621, after his fall, Bacon composed a prayer
which Addison quoted as resembling the devotions of an angel rather than
those of a man \[175: 467\]. No truer or higher poetry is found in the
plays or "Sonnets" than is found in it. No man with a soul in his body
can read it and doubt its absolute candor and honesty. In it he says: "I
have (though in a despised weed) procured the good of all men." No one
has ever explained what this "good of all men," which Bacon had procured
and which went about in a despised dress, might be. Is there anything
else it could be except the plays? "The good of all men" is such an
immense phrase that the object referred to must necessarily be enormous.
What other such object could there have been in Bacon's mind at the
time? Well, his philosophical works—the "De Augmentis" and the "Novum
Organum" and the rest? Yes, it would doubtless be true of them. But the
object spoken of

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

was in a despised dress. Were they? Quite the contrary. They were in a
genuine, high-class, philosophic garb as to form and style—more, they
were in the best Latin that could, for love or money, be procured for
them.

*m*. Bornmann \[28\] and Ruggles \[145\], in two fascinating volumes and
from somewhat different points of view, have ably pointed out (as indeed
had been done several times before but not so systematically) how
persistently the thought of Bacon and that of "Shakespeare" run in the
same channel; how the science and philosophy of the first are constantly
worked into the poetry of the second, becoming its very life blood and
soul, and how the method laid down and followed by the one is never lost
sight of by the other. Indeed, if nothing had ever been written on the
subject except these two books (and they do not touch the main, stock
arguments) they would go far along to a demonstration of the proposition
that the man who wrote the "Tempest," "Lear" and "Merchant of Venice"
wrote also the "De Augmentis" and the "Silva Silvarium."

*n*. Finally, consider the anagram discovered by Dr. Platt, at that time
of New Jersey, in "Love's Labor's Lost" \[51: 376\]: "Beginning at the
commencement of the fifth act, we meet one after another the following:
Satis quod sufficit (that which suffices is enough) . Novi hominen
tanquam te (I know the man as well as I know you). Ne intelligis domine
(do you understand me, sir)? Laus Deo, bene, intelligo (praise God, I
understand well). Videsne quis venit? (do you see who comes)? Video et
gaudeo (I see and rejoice). Quare (wherefore)? Then, a few lines further
on, the word Honorificabilitudinitatibus is (as it were) flung into the
text. Immediately afterwards one says: 'Are you not lettered?' The
answer is: 'Yes, he teaches boys the hornbook.' 'What is a b spelt
backward, with the horn on his head?' The answer to that, of course, is
'Ba, with a horn added.' Now, 'Ba' with a horn added is Bacornu, which
is not, but suggests, and was probably meant to suggest, Bacon. But
whence is derived the a b which is to be spelt backward? In the middle
of the long word we find these letters in that order—a b. Begin,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

now, at the b and spell backward as you are told. You get bacifironoh.
From these letters it is not hard to pick out Fr. Bacon. Now take the
other half of the word spelt forward—ilitudinitatibus. It is not hard to
pick out from it ludi (the plays), tuiti (protected or guarded), nati
(produced). These words, with those we had before, give us: Ludi tuiti
Fr. Bacono nati. The remaining letters are hiiibs, which are easily read
as hi sibi. Now put the words together in grammatical order and you
have: Hi ludi, tuiti sibi, Fr. Bacono nati (these plays entrusted to
themselves proceeded from Fr. Bacon). It is a perfect anagram. Each
letter is used once and once only. The form of the long word is Latin
and it is read in Latin. The sense of the infolded words corresponds
with the sense, so far as it has any \[compare honorificare, honorifico;
see Century Dictionary\], of the infolding word. The infolded Latin is
grammatical. The intention is fully declared and plain. There is no
flaw.

"But where, now, does the long word come from, and can a connection be
traced between it and the actual man, Francis Bacon? To answer this,
turn back to the Northumberland House MS. mentioned above. That MS.
belonged to Bacon, and could never have been seen by the actor,
Shakespeare. On the outer leaf is written the word:
Honorificabilitudino. This also is an anagram. It infolds the words:
Initio hi ludi Fr. Bacono (in the beginning these plays from Fr. Bacon).
It seems to have been a first thought. The Latin words do not form a
complete sentence; they suggest a meaning, but do not actually contain
one. The anagram in this form was not considered satisfactory, and was
amended into the form found in 'Love's Labor's Lost.'

"Thus we have before us the making of the word by Bacon. The sense of
the word and its history correspond. The case seems to be complete."

*o*. But arguments such as above, though cogent and indeed of themselves
sufficient if frankly considered, are no longer necessary to establish,
although they may be allowed to suggest, the Baconian authorship of the
plays and poems, since the writer within the last two years has
discovered that these are all or nearly

all signed by Francis Bacon, by means of a cipher invented by himself
and kept to himself for forty odd years. The evidence upon which this
statement rests, if not already published by the time this volume is
issued, will very soon thereafter be given to the world.

##### VIII.

But the present volume has nothing to do with the Bacon-Shakespeare
question except incidentally, by the way, and perforce. *Somebody* wrote
the plays and "Sonnets," and that person, whoever he might be, had, it
is believed, Cosmic Consciousness. And just as there is found in nearly
all these cases two classes of writing—that, namely, which flows from
the Cosmic Sense and that which, springing up in the self conscious
mind, treats directly of the Cosmic Sense as an (to it) objective
reality—so these two classes of writing are found here: (1) The plays,
treating of the world of men and flowing directly from the Cosmic Sense,
and (2) the "Sonnets," treating (from the point of view of the self
conscious man) in a subtle, hidden manner, as is usual and indeed
inevitable, of the Cosmic Sense itself.

It remains (all that can be done here) to give as many of the "Sonnets"
as there is space for, accompanied by the necessary explanatory remarks.

##### IX.

The first seventeen "Sonnets" urge the Cosmic Sense to produce. The
theory is that they were written, as they stand, earliest, and that they
were the first writings of their author after illumination. If it be
thought singular that a man should so write, then compare this with an
undoubted case of precisely the same thing as is here supposed. The 1855
edition of "Leaves of Grass" was written by Whitman immediately after
illumination. On the third page of the "Leaves" (the preface was written
afterwards) stand these words, addressed to the Cosmic Sense:

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

"Loose the stop from your throat—not words, not music or rhyme I want;
not custom or lecture, not even the best, only the lull I like, the hum
of your valved voice." In the case of Whitman, as in the case of Buddha
and Jesus, the special urge of the Cosmic Sense was towards an exalted
life. In the case of Bacon, as in that of Balzac, it was especially
towards literary expression. In accordance with this distinction,
Whitman writes, in a long life, two small volumes; Bacon, in a shorter
life, ten or twenty times as much. Whitman's invocation occupies three
lines; Bacon's, two hundred lines.

year of first illumination is known with more or less certainty in
twenty, and in fifteen of these it took place in the first half of the
year—January to June. Did perhaps Bacon's illumination take place in the
spring? And is that the meaning of the line?

The fairest of all things is what Plotinus calls "this sublime
condition," and of which Dante said: "Oh splendor of living light
eternal! Who hath become so pallid under the shadow of Parnassus, or
hath so drunk at its cistern, that he would not seem to have his mind
encumbered, trying to represent thee as thou didst appear there where in
harmony the heaven overshadows thee when in the open air thou didst

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_171-1">\*</span> Sonnet XXXIII refers to the intermittent
character of illumination, which holds true in all cases of Cosmic
Consciousness, in which there is more than one flash of the divine
radiance. It treats of the cheerlessness and barrenness of the intervals
as compared with those periods when the Cosmic Sense is actually
present. So Behmen, referring to the intermittent character of his
illumination, says \[40: 16\]: "The sun shone on me a good while but not
constantly, for the sun hid itself, and then I knew not nor well
understood my own labor" (his own writings). Note the use of the same
figure by both writers. So also Yepes tells us: ''When these visions
occur, it is as if a door were opened into a most marvellous light,
whereby the soul sees, as men do when the lightning flashes in a dark
night. The lightning makes surrounding objects visible for an instant,
and then leaves them in darkness, though the forms of them remain in the
fancy. But in the case of the soul the vision is much more perfect; for
those things it saw in spirit in that light are so impressed upon it,
that whenever God enlightens it again, it beholds them as distinctly as
it did at first, precisely as in a mirror, in which we see objects
reflected whenever we look upon it. These visions once granted to the
soul never afterward leave it altogether; for the forms remain, though
they become somewhat indistinct in the course of time. The effects of
these visions in the soul are quietness, enlightenment, joy-like glory,
sweetness, pureness, love, humility, inclination or elevation of the
mind to God, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes more of one,
sometimes more of another, according to the disposition of the soul and
the will of God" \[203: 200–1\]. With the last words of Yepes compare
Paul: "The fruit of the spirit \[Christ, the Cosmic Sense\] is love,
joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness,
temperance" \[22: 5: 22\].

Let me confess that we two must be twain,

So shall those blots that do with me remain,  
Without thy help, by me be borne alone.

Though in our lives a separate spite,  
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,  
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight. <span

I may not evermore acknowledge thee,  
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame;  
Nor thou with public kindness honor me,

But do not so; I love thee in such sort  
As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_171-2">\*</span> <span id="page_171">p. 171</span> It is
reasonable to suppose that this sonnet represents a later date than
those above quoted. It is fair to imagine, therefore, that when it was
written quite a body of the plays was in existence. For some years Bacon
has been leading a dual life: on the one hand the life of a lawyer,
<span id="page_172">p. 172</span> courtier, politician—his self
conscious life: on the other the life of the seer, poet—the life lit by
that "light rare, untellable, lighting the very light"—the ''light that
never was on land or sea"—the life, in a word, of Cosmic Consciousness.
He had kept these two lives entirely apart. None or few (Anthony,
perhaps, and Mathews) knew that he was living any other life than the
first. It had for many strong reasons, and feelings stronger than
reasons, become with him a settled policy that the two lives were to be
kept apart. The frank duality of this and some other of the "Sonnets"
will be almost or quite incomprehensible to many as applied to two parts
of the same person or two personalities in the same individual. But we
know that (supposing the interpretation here adopted to be correct) the
language of the "Sonnets" is not more extreme in this respect than is
language in other of these cases in which there can be no doubt as to
its meaning. Thus Whitman writes: "With laugh and many a kiss O soul
thou pleasest me, I thee" \[193: 321\]. And again: "I, turning, call to
thee O soul, thou actual me \[ib.\].

The writer of the sonnet says, or seems to say, that should he
acknowledge his other self, the Cosmic Sense, and its offspring, the
plays, any good that could do him (the self conscious person) would be
taken from this higher self, and that he will not consent to.

And our dear love lose name of single one,  
That by this separation I may give  
That due to thee which thou deserv’t alone.  
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,  
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_172-1">\*</span> The meaning of this sonnet seems
unmistakable. It scarcely needs a commentary. The author says that the
Cosmic Sense is the best part of him (as, of course, it was), and being
part of himself, it is scarcely mannerly in him to praise it. But (he
says) for this very reason let us live as two. His absence from the
Cosmic Sense is, of course, the time he is occupied with law, politics,
business, worldly affairs—all that time, in fact, between the periods of
illumination, when his time and mind were not occupied with the things
of the Cosmic Sense. That absence is made happy by the knowledge that at
any time he can turn to thoughts of the Cosmic Sense and of the things
belonging to it. The most striking expression in this sonnet is: "Thou
\[the Cosmic Sense\] teachest how to make one twain." This is, as
pointed out many times in this volume, a prime characteristic of the
cases in question. "The attainment of Arahatship" (Cosmic
Consciousness), says Gautama, will cause a man, "being one, to become
multiform" \[161: 214\]. "I live," says Paul, "yet no longer I but
Christ \[the Cosmic Sense\] liveth in me" \[22: 2: 20\]. And again: "If
any man be in Christ \[if any mad live the life of the Cosmic Sense\] he
is a new creature" \[21: 5: 17\]; and Paul says that the man Jesus
''made both \[that is, (1) the Cosmic Sense—Christ, and (2) the self
conscious man—Jesus\] one," . . . "that he might create of the twain one
new man" \[23: 2: 14–15\], and is many other places he bears testimony
to his own dual personality. Mohammed called the Cosmic Sense "Gabriel";
the Koran was dictated by him (or it): the ostensible Mohammed was a
second individuality. Balzac, speaking of Louis

Lambert (i.e., himself), after giving his life down to the period of
illumination, says: "The events I have still to relate form the *second
existence* of this creature destined to be exceptional in all things"
\[5: 100\]. He then goes on to describe the oncoming of the Cosmic
Conscious condition, and, in the aphorisms, Cosmic Consciousness itself.
Whitman constantly refers to the Cosmic Sense as his soul, and calls the
every day, visible, Walt Whitman, "The other I am" \[193: 32\], and so
on.

the elevation (mercifully made possible for us) above the limits of the
body and the world. I myself have realized it but three times as yet"
\[188: 81\]. Bacon's periods of illumination were probably longer and
more frequent than those of Plotinus. Neither Plotinus nor Bacon,
apparently, could control the periods of lumination. It seems likely
that Jesus refers to this apparently causeless and arbitrary coming and
going of the divine light when he said \[17: 3: 8\]: "The wind bloweth
where it listeth and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not
whence it cometh and whither it goeth; *so is every one that is born of

angry, the peaceable, the deluded, the wise, the concentrated, the ever
varying, the lofty, the narrow, the sublime, the mean, the steadfast,
the wavering, the free, and the enslaved" \[161: 215\]. That is, it
reveals all character, as is so well exemplified in the "Shakespeare"
drama. Compare Dante's world-wide vision; Balzac's insight into the
structure and operation of the infinite human heart; Whitman's "I am of
old and of young, of the foolish as much as the wise, regardless of
others, ever regardful of others, maternal as well as paternal, a child
as well as a man," etc. \[193: 42\], and the almost universal knowledge
of man and his environment which his writings, especially the "Leaves,"
indicate.

If there be nothing new, but that which is  
Hath been before, how are our brains beguil’d,  
Which, laboring for invention, bears amiss  
The second burden of a former child!  
O that record could with a backward look,  
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,  
Show me your image in some antique book,  
Since mind at first in character was done!  
That I might see what the old world could say  
To this composed wonder of your frame;  
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,  
Or whether revolution be the same.  
O, sure I am, the wits of former days  
To subjects worse have given admiring praise.

<span id="an_174-2">\*</span> The writer asks: "Is this illumination of
which I am conscious a new phenomenon or did it exist in the old world?
I wish," he says, "I could find it or a description of it in literature.
If it has existed it ought to be found in the records of the human mind,
and if I could find such records I could judge whether the human mind
was advancing, retreating, or standing still." He seems to reach the
conclusion that few or none of the great writers of the past experienced
it. Bacon was exceedingly familiar with the Bible, and therefore with
the gospels and the Pauline epistles, but his reverence for these
writings would probably prevent his comparing his experience to that of
the sacred writers. It does not seem that he knew much of Dante; and the
Buddhistic literature, in which it is fully treated, was an absolutely
sealed book to Englishmen of his time. It would never have occurred to
him to examine the Koran and the life of Mohammed, if, indeed, they were
accessible to him. Bacon was thus probably entirely cut off from any
knowledge of other cases than his own.

Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye,  
And all my soul, and all my every part;  
And for this sin there is no remedy,  
It is so grounded inward in my heart.  
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine, <span id="page_175">p.

No shape so true, no truth of such account;  
And for myself my own worth do define,  
As I all other in all worth surmount.  
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,  
Beated and chopp’d with tann’d antiquity,  
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;  
Self so self-loving were iniquity.  
’Tis thee (myself) that for myself I praise,  
Painting my age with beauty of thy days.

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_175-1">\*</span> In this sonnet the duality of the person
writing is brought out very strongly—no doubt purposely. When he dwells
on his Cosmic Conscious self he is, as it were, lost in admiration of
himself. When he turns to the physical and self conscious self he is
inclined, on the contrary, to despise himself. He is at the same time
very much and very little of an egotist. Those who knew the man Walt
Whitman know that this same seeming contradiction, resting on the same
foundation, existed most markedly in him. Whitman 's admiration for the
Cosmic Conscious Whitman and his works (the "Leaves") was just such as
pictured in this sonnet, while he was absolutely devoid of egotism in
the ordinary way of the self conscious individual. It is believed that
the above remarks would remain true if applied to Pau 1, Mohammed or
Balzac. Reduced to last analysis, the matter seems to stand about as
follows: The Cosmic Conscious self, from all points of view, appears
superb, divine. From the point of view of the Cosmic Conscious self, the
body and the self conscious self appear equally divine. But from the
point of view of the ordinary self consciousness, and so compared with
the Cosmic Conscious self, the self conscious self and the body seem
insignificant and even, as well shown in Paul's case, contemptible.

The ornament of beauty is suspect,  
A crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air.  
So thou be good, slander doth but approve  
Thy worth the greater, being woo’d of time;  
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,  
And thou present’st a pure unstained prime.  
Thou hast pass’d by the ambush of young days,  
Either not assail’d, or victor being charg’d;  
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,  
To tie up envy, evermore enlarg’d:

<span id="an_175-2">\*</span> Bacon says: That a Cosmic Sense (as seen
in its offspring, the plays) should be blamed (as for license in
language, contempt of received rules, etc.) shall be no proof of defect.
Great original work, such as the "Shakespeare" drama, is never
appreciated at first, is, in fact, always the object of grave suspicion
and often of absolute condemnation. If, he says, the Cosmic Sense is
really the divine thing it seems to be, evil speaking of it and its
offspring only proves it the more divine, as showing it is over the
heads and above the judgment of ordinary men. If it was not for this
inevitable blindness all eyes and hearts would recognize and bow down
before its supremacy.

So oft have I invok’d thee for my Muse,

Have added feathers to the learned’s wing, <span id="page_176">p.

And given grace a double majesty.  
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,  
Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span> <span id="an_175-3">\*</span> At the
time this sonnet was written many of the plays were composed, published,
and doubtless imitated. The writer speaks of himself as "ignorant"
because he has had no training or practice in verse writing. The Cosmic
Sense had immediately upon its appearance <span id="page_176">p.
176</span> "taught the hitherto dumb" man "on high to sing." Becoming
illumined at about the age of thirty, he not only began without any
apprenticeship to write poetry, but to write a new and higher poetry
than had hitherto been written in English. And he says that the divine
light shining through his compositions (the plays) has been (to some
extent, at all events) absorbed and utilized by the verse writers of the
day; has added feathers to their wings, and given a double majesty to
the grace of their lines. So Lang says of Scott that he "was being
driven from post to pillar by his imitators, whom he had taught, like
Captain Boabdil, to write nearly as well as himself" \[169: 9\]. But he
says to the Cosmic Sense, be most proud of what I produce, for the
merits of that come not all from study, cleverness or practice, but
entirely from yourself.

Compare with the above statement the cases of Jesus, Paul, Mohammed,
Balzac and Walt Whitman, who either had no practice or training, or (as
in the case of Balzac) derived little or no benefit therefrom, but who
in middle life, began immediately upon illumination, either to speak or
to write undying words.

Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,  
Bound for the prize of all-too-precious you,  
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inherse,  
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?  
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write  
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?  
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night  
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.  
He, nor that affable familiar ghost  
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,  
As victors, of my silence cannot boast;  
I was not sick of any fear from thence:  
But when your countenance fill’d up his line  
Then lack’d I matter; that enfeebled mine.

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_176-1">\*</span> In this sonnet reduplication of the
individual, Bacon-Shakespeare, is carried to the farthest pitch. We are
forcibly reminded (once more) of Gautama's words in this connection,
viz., that Cosmic Consciousness (or Arahatship, as he calls it), "will
make a man, being one, to become multiform"—not merely two, but
multiform. Few or no sonnets (it would seem) have been written for some
time by the "other I am." But the Cosmic Conscious personality had been
producing rapidly. Several or many plays had been written within a brief
period. The Cosmic Conscious Bacon had been taught by the Cosmic Sense
to write "above a mortal pitch." It was not that, however, which struck
dumb the self conscious Bacon. But it was the fact that the Cosmic
Conscious individual had absorbed (for the time at least) into himself
all the forces of the complex organism. As to the "compeers" of the
Cosmic Sense, they are the spiritual entities spoken of by Balzac.
"Mysterious beings armed with wondrous faculties, who combine with other
beings and penetrate them as active agents, beings which overpower
others with the scepter and glory of a superior nature" \[7: 50\]. Then
in line nine "He" is the Cosmic Conscious Bacon, while the "affable
familiar ghost" is Cosmic Consciousness. The expression, "Nightly gulls
him with intelligence," may be compared with Whitman's "Message from the
heavens whispering to me even in sleep" \[193: 324\]. It may be noted
here (most readers will observe it for themselves) that when speaking of
the same experience Whitman's language is more moderate, lower toned,
than Balzac's, Dante's or perhaps any other of the Cosmic Conscious
writers.

How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame,  
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,  
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!  
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!  
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,  
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,  
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;  
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.  
O, what a mansion have those vices got  
Which for their habitation chose out thee,  
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,  
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!  
Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;  
The hardest knife ill-us’d doth lose his edge.

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_177-1">\*</span> "How sweet and lovely dost thou make the
shame." Helen Price says that in 1866 Walt Whitman (who wanted a
publisher for ''Leaves of Grass" badly enough at that time) was offered
by a prominent house good terms on condition that he would consent to
the deletion of a few lines of "Children of Adam." An hour or two after
the offer was made he returned to her mother 's house in New York, where
he was then staying, and, after telling her and her mother of the offer,
said: "But I dare not do it, I dare not leave out or alter what is so
genuine, so indispensable, so lofty, so pure" \[38: 32\]. So, as to an
earlier episode in his life, he told the writer \[38: 26\]: "When
'Leaves of Grass,' in 1855, roused such a tempest of anger and
condemnation, I went off to the east end of Long Island and spent the
late summer and all the fall—the happiest of my life—around Shelter
Island and Peconic Bay. Then came back to New York with the confirmed
resolution, from which I never afterwards wavered, to go on with my
poetic enterprise in my own way and finish it as well as I could." A
corresponding incident in Balzac's life occurred in connection with the
publication of "Le Médecin de Campagne." In 1833 (shortly after
illumination) he wrote to his much loved sister that that book would
reach her next week: "It has cost me," he said, "ten times the work
'Louis Lambert' did. . .. That labor was frightful. I may now die in
peace; I have done a great work for my country." Two months afterwards
he writes again: "Do you know how 'Le Médecin' has been received? By a
torrent of insults; . . . but I have chosen my path; nothing shall
discourage me. . .. Never has the torrent which bears me onward been so
rapid; no more terribly majestic work has ever compelled the human
brain" \[4: 142–3\]. Line four, ("O in what sweets," etc.) refers to the
vices, crimes, meannesses in the plays (the acts of Regan, Goneril,
Edmund, Iago, etc.) . And does not a veil of beauty cover them all? That
tongue, he says, that tells the visions, the revelations, which proceed
from the Cosmic Sense, "cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise." ("And
I say," says Whitman, "that there is in fact no evil") \[193: 22\]. Then
he cautions the Cosmic Sense to take "heed of this large privilege." And
so we see Whitman "returning upon \[his\] poems, considering, lingering
long," and striking out words and expressions that seem to him too free.
This sonnet is one of the most difficult to fully enter into the meaning
of, but when this is realized it is perhaps the most exquisite passage
ever written by its author. The most exquisite in expression and in
metaphysical subtlety. No comment, perhaps, certainly no comment by the
present editor, can do it even the most meager justice.

plays (the offspring of the Cosmic Sense) are variously judged. What,
for instance, seems "wantonness" to one to another is "gentle sport."
Both faults and graces <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> are commended;
for faults are made graces by the alchemy of the Cosmic Sense. "I am
myself," says Whitman, "just as much evil as good, and my nation is, and
I say there is in fact no evil" \[193: 22\]. And Paul says: "I know and
am persuaded in the Lord Jesus \[that is, by the Cosmic Sense\] that
nothing is unclean of itself." As a base jewel on the hand of a queen
passes for a rich gem, so all things in you (the Cosmic Sense) are
beautiful, true and good. If you should give free expression to this
revelation (using the strength of all your state) you would lead many
astray (for they would misunderstand you), and you yourself (in your
progeny—such as Paul's Epistles, the "Shakespeare" drama, the "Leaves of
Grass," etc.) would be condemned and would be so hindered doing your
proper work in the world, therefore "do not so."

And yet this time removed was summer’s time;  
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,  
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,  
Like widow’d wombs after their lord’s decease:  
Yet this abundant issue seem’d to me  
But hope of orphans, and unfather’d fruit;

more properly speaking, its only occasional presence in even the
greatest cases—see comment on Sonnet XXXIII. As elsewhere pointed out,
even self consciousness, which has perhaps existed in the race for
several hundred thousand years, and now appears in the individual at
about three years of age, is liable to lapse. How very far from constant
must then a new faculty like Cosmic Consciousness be! The writer speaks
of a time when the Cosmic Sense was absent. But (as he puts it) it was
he that was absent from the Cosmic Sense—that being considered the real
person. So Whitman speaks of the Cosmic Sense as himself, and of the
self conscious Whitman as "the other I am." And yet, he says, it was a
period of very free production—as there is no reason it should not have
been—for what is revealed by the Cosmic Sense remains clear and manifest
even for months and years, supposing there should be no subsequent
illumination. Compare Yepes, as quoted in comment on Sonnet XXXIII. But
though a period of sufficient (reflected) light and of free production,
it was joyless and bare as compared with periods during which the Cosmic
Sense was actually present.

If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,  
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,  
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill  
May time disgrace, and wretched minutes kill.  
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!  
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:  
Her audit, though delay’d, answer’d must be,  
And her quietus is to render thee.

</div>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_179-1">\*</span> This sonnet constitutes the close of the
address to Cosmic Consciousness. It was probably written very shortly
before publication (1609), after the writer had been ''illumined with'
the Brahmic Splendor" \[155: 232\] nearly twenty years and had produced,
under its influence, nearly the whole "Shakespeare" drama. O lovely boy,
he says, addressing for the last time the Cosmic Sense, who in the
hollow of thy hand Both hold time and death—who waning (as age advances
within me) has grown (in the plays, thy products), and thereby showest
thyself constantly augmenting as thy mortal lovers wither and die. If
Nature should desire (as her way is) to destroy thee (the plays—children
of Cosmic Consciousness) she yet will not, but will keep thee to show
that she is able to disgrace time by making what he cannot kill. Not
only so, but also to show that this product of Nature can even kill time
(destroy wretched minutes). Yet do thou (Nature's favorite—the Cosmic
Sense—the plays) still fear Nature, who may keep thee for a time, but
perhaps not forever. As to her (Nature), though her rule is so strong,
she must one day give an account of herself to a stronger power. That
power is thee (Cosmic Consciousness), whom when evolution (which is
Nature) has produced (that is, made general—as self consciousness is
to-day), she (Nature) will have received her quietus. For the full
apparition of the Cosmic Sense will destroy death, the fear of death,
sin and space. "Then cometh the end, when he \[Christ—Cosmic
Consciousness\] shall deliver up the kingdom to God even the Father,
when he shall have abolished all rule, and all authority and power. For
he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last
enemy that shall be abolished is death" \[20: 15: 24–26\]. For Cosmic
Consciousness will throw the things of sense (of self consciousness—of
Nature, as we know her to-day, which now absorb men's thoughts) so into
the background as practically to abolish them. Nature, instead of being
the Lord, as now, will be a slave—will effectually, in fact, receive her
quietus.

</div>

#### SUMMARY.

In this case the ordinary details of proof of illumination are largely
wanting. If William Shakespeare wrote the plays and "Sonnets," we have
absolutely no external evidence to build upon. If Francis Bacon wrote
them, we have the vague evidence of his seclusion at about the time his
illumination (if at all) must have taken place, and Hawley's and his own
seeming allusion to the possession by him of some such unusual, very
exalted, faculty. Over and above these circumstances, which to most will
seem very slight, the argument that the man who wrote the plays and
"Sonnets" had Cosmic Consciousness must rest upon these writings
themselves and would consist of two clauses. (1) The creator of the
plays was perhaps the greatest intellect the world has seen. His moral
intuitions were as true as his intellect was great. He

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

was from all points of view a transcendently great spiritual force.
Being so, he ought (according to the thesis maintained in this volume)
to have had Cosmic Consciousness. (2) The first one hundred and
twenty-six sonnets seem to show beyond doubt that their author had the
Cosmic Sense and that these sonnets were addressed to it. It does not
seem to the present writer that they can be made sense of (intelligently
read) from any other standpoint.
