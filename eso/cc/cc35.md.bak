*Cosmic Consciousness*, by Richard Maurice Bucke, \[1901\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER 12.

*William Wordsworth*.

1770–1850.

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> the mind of this writer (nearly if
not quite a poet) in his loftier moods attained a very close
neighborhood to Cosmic Consciousness, if he did not actually enter the
magic territory of the kingdom of heaven, no one will deny who knows
what these words mean and who also has read him with any sympathy. In
fact the following short passages, from lines written at Tintern Abbey
in his twenty-ninth year, prove as much. In the first he speaks of "that
blessed mood"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

In which the burden of the mystery,  
In which the heavy and the weary weight  
Of all this unintelligible world, <span id="page_286">p. 286</span>  
Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood  
In which the affections gently lead us on,—  
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame  
And even the motion of our human blood  
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep  
In body, and becomes a living soul.  
While with an eye made quiet by the power  
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,  
We see into the life of things \[198: 187\].

This passage indicates plainly the relief (approaching to joy) and the
enlightenment (approximating illumination) which belong to the unrisen
sun of the Cosmic Sense. But there is no evidence that upon him, at any
time, the sun actually rose—that the veil was ever rent and the splendor
let through; in fact it may be considered as quite clear that this did
not happen. Then, next line, follows the usual doubt:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

If this but be a vain belief

</div>

</div>

(whether or not the revelation can be relied on)—a question never asked,
at least after the first few minutes or hours, by a person who has
obtained even one glimpse of the "Brahmic Splendor."

Later, in the same poem, is another passage describing in other words
the same mental condition, which may be properly called the twilight of
Cosmic Consciousness:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

                           I have felt  
A presence that disturbs me with the joy  
Of elevated thought; a sense sublime  
Of something far more deeply interfused,  
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,  
And the round ocean and the living air,  
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man—  
A motion and a spirit, that impels  
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,  
And rolls through all things \[198: 189\].
