### NOTICE

*It will be observed that this volume is printed in three types: in the
largest is set up that portion of it which was written by the editor,
together with certain shorter quotations which will be indicated by
inverted commas in the usual manner; extracts from writers having Cosmic
Consciousness and from other writers about them will be printed in
medium sized type, and it will not be considered necessary to use
quotation marks with it, since all matter in this type will be quoted
and the writers of it will necessarily be credited each with his own
part; the small type will be used for parallel passages and for comment,
and with this inverted commas will be used in the ordinary manner*.
