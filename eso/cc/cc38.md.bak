### CHAPTER 15.

*Ralph Waldo Emerson*.

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> May, 1803; died April, 1882.

Spiritually eminent as was this great American, it does not appear that
he belonged to the class of men discussed in this volume. He was perhaps
as near Cosmic Consciousness as it is possible

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

to be without actually entering that realm. He lived in the light of the
great day, but there is no evidence that its sun for him actually rose.
Emerson's "Oversoul" was printed in 1841, when the author was
thirty-eight years old. In it he tells us plainly where he stood at that
time, and it is as good as certain that in later years he did not
advance beyond that position. In it he says, for instance:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

There is a difference between one and another hour of life, in their
authority and subsequent effect.[\*](cc38.htm#an_291-1.md)

There is a depth in those brief moments which constrains us to ascribe
more reality to them than to all other experiences.

Every man's words,[\*](cc38.htm#an_291-2.md) who speaks from that life,
must sound vain to those who do not dwell in the same thought on their
own part.

Only itself can inspire whom it will, and behold! their speech shall be
lyrical, and sweet, and universal as the rising of the wind.

In ascending to this primary and aboriginal sentiment, we have come from
our remote station on the circumference instantaneously to the centre of
the world, where, as in the closet of God, we see causes, and anticipate
the universe, which is but a slow effect.

This energy does not descend into individual life, or any other
condition than entire possession. It comes to the lowly and simple; it
comes to whomsoever will put off what is foreign and proud; it comes as
insight; it comes as serenity and grandeur. When we see those whom it
inhabits we are apprized of new degrees of greatness. From that
inspiration the man comes back with a changed tone. He does not talk
with men, with an eye to their opinion. He tries them. It requires of us
to be plain and true. The vain traveler attempts to embellish his life
by quoting my lord, and the prince, and the countess, who thus said or
did to him. The ambitious vulgar show you their spoons, and brooches,
and rings, and preserve their cards and compliments. The more
cultivated, in their account of their own experience, cull out the
pleasing poetic circumstance; the visit to Rome, the man of genus they
saw; the brilliant friend they know; still further on, perhaps, the
gorgeous landscape, the mountain lights, the mountain thoughts, they
enjoyed yesterday—and so seek to throw a romantic color over their life.
But the soul that ascendeth to worship the great God is plain and true;
has no rose color; no fine friends; no chivalry; no adventures; does not
want admiration; dwells in the hour that now is, in the earnest
experience of the common day—by reason of the present moment, and the
mere trifle having become porous to thought, and bibulous of the sea of
light.

<span id="an_291-1">\*</span> If he had had experience of the Cosmic
Vision—the Brahmic Splendor—he could not have used this exceedingly
moderate, even cold, language when referring thereto. Neither could he
omitting that, be here referring to other experiences.

<span id="an_291-2">\*</span> These passages show how deep, however
short of the bottomless deep, Emerson 's spiritual experience was.
