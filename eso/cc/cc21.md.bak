### CHAPTER 12.

*Honoré de Balzac*.

##### I.

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> 1799; died 1850.

"Perhaps the greatest name in the post-Revolutionary literature of
France" \[78: 304\].

And well summed up by a still more recent writer, W. P. Trent \[3:
566\]:

"The unexpected," he tells us, "sometimes happens, as I discovered
recently when I finished the fiftieth volume of M. Calmann Levy's
popular edition of the works of Balzac. I had thought that the
completion of Horace's odes and Shakespeare's

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

plays, and of the 'Odyssey,' marked the three chief epochs in my own
intellectual life, and that I might not likely be so stirred, so swept
away again, by any book or by any author. But I had erred. Balzac, whose
novels taken singly had moved me powerfully, but had not often swept me
away, whom I had made a companion of for years without fully
comprehending—this Balzac, when viewed in the light of his total and
stupendous achievements, suddenly stood out before me in his full
stature and might, as one of the few genuine world geniuses that our
race can point to with legitimate and unshakable pride. I had emerged
from the 'Comédie Humaine' just as I had emerged from the Homeric poems
and from the plays of Shakespeare, feeling that I had traversed a world
and been in the presence of a veritable creator."

Still another and even more recent writer may be quoted to the same
effect. H. T. Peck \[128a: 245\] sums up the result of his studies as
follows: "The place which this great genius must ultimately hold in
literary history has not yet been definitely settled. French critics
link his name with that of Shakespeare, while English critics seem to
think that a comparison like this is very daring. My own belief is that
at the last his name will be placed higher still than Shakespeare's, at
the very apex of a pyramid of literary fame."

"Search as one may, there is no complete life of Balzac. There are still
unpublished letters and papers in the possession of the Vicomte de
Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, a compatriot who thoroughly understood him; but
adding these to all that has been written, it is still doubtful if the
real man will be found behind them. Expansive at times, yet he withdrew
from the knowledge of others. There are periods in his life when he
disappears, lies concealed from sight, and each must interpret for
himself the secret that made his power and insures his fame."

Balzac put the following words into the mouth of Dante, who he tells us
was a "Specialist." Balzac was himself a "Specialist." The words will
therefore apply as well to him as to Dante: "And so that poor lad thinks
himself an angel exiled from heaven Who among us has the right to
undeceive him? Is it I? I who

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

am so often lifted above this earth by magic power; I who belong to God;
I who am to myself a mystery? Have I not seen the most beautiful of all
angels \[the Cosmic Sense\] living on this base earth? Is the lad either
more or less beside himself than I am? Has he taken a bolder step into
faith? He believes; his belief will doubtless lead him into some
luminous path like that in which I walk" \[9: 263\].

That Balzac stood apart from and on a higher plane than ordinary men was
divined during his life and has been perceived by thousands since his
death. Taine, groping after an explanation of the obvious fact, says:
"His instrument was intuition, that dangerous and superior faculty by
which man imagines or discovers in an isolated fact all the
possibilities of which it is capable; a kind of second sight proper to
prophets and somnambules, who sometimes find the true, who often find
the false, and who commonly attain only verisimilitude" \[6: 12\].

G. F. Parsons, in his introduction to "Louis Lambert," comes nearer it
when he asks: "Whether the condition \[of chronic ecstasy, in which the
patient—i.e., Louis Lambert—really Balzac himself—seems withdrawn\] may
not be the consequence of an illumination so much higher than that
vouchsafed mankind at large as to transcend expression—to separate the
recipient from intellectual contact with his fellows by revealing to his
inner sense untranslatable things" \[6: 11\].

This last seems to be the simple truth, Balzac, very clearly, having
been a well marked case of Cosmic Consciousness. The evidence that he
was so resides (1) in the fact of his life as observed by others, and
(2) in his own revelations as to his inner self. The first series of
facts may be gathered from his biography, compiled by K. P. Wormeley,
largely from memoirs written by Balzac's sister Laure—Madame Surville;
the second from Balzac's own writings, and chiefly from "Louis Lambert"
and "Seraphita." And first as to his outer life as revealing the inner:
Miss W. says: "A complete life of Balzac cannot be written at the
present time and possibly never can be. Nearly the whole of what he was
to himself, what his own being was, what were the

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

influences that molded it, how that eye that saw the manifold lives of
others saw his own life, how that soul which crowned its earthly work
with a vision of the living word was nurtured—what that soul was, in
short, has been concealed from sight" \[4: 1\]. "In all estimates of
Balzac's nature attention must be paid to the fact that he was eminently
sound and healthy in mind and body. Though his spirit rose to regions
that could be reached only by intuition, and ruminated over problems the
study of which we associate with fragility of body and aloofness from
things of life, he was at the same time, and quite as thoroughly, a man
with human instincts, loving life and enjoying it. In this lies, no
doubt, one of the secrets of his power. It was a part of the
many-sidedness of his genius; it enabled him to actually live and have
his being in the men and women whom he evoked from the depths and
heights of human nature. His temperament was, above all things, genial
and his humor gay; no pressure of worldly anxiety and debt, no crushing
toil, no hidden grief, with which the man, like the child in his cell,
was acquainted, could destroy that healthy cheerfulness or prevent the
rebound into hearty or even jovial gaiety. 'Robust' is the word that
seems to suit him on the material side of his nature, applying even to
his mental processes. He was gifted with a strong common sense, which
guided his judgment on men and circumstances" \[4: 58–9\].

While still very young Balzac decided to be a writer. It seems that he
felt, even as a boy, that he was destined to do something great in that
line, and he composed at school, among other things, a treatise on the
will and an epic poem. Later he wrote at Paris, in the course of ten
years, mostly over the pseudonym of "Horace de Saint Aubin," some forty
volumes, said to be almost entirely valueless. A good authority \[106:
87\] sums up this episode in Balzac's history as follows: "Before he was
thirty years old he had published, under a variety of pseudonyms, some
twenty long novels, veritable Grub Street productions, written in sordid
Paris attics, in poverty, in perfect obscurity. Several of these "œuvres
de jeunesse" have lately been republished, but the best of them are
unreadable. No writer ever served harder apprenticeship

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

to his art, or lingered more hopelessly at the base of the ladder of
fame."

Then, at the age of thirty, his genius began to dawn in "Les Chouans"
and "Physiologie du Marriage." He must have entered Cosmic Consciousness
about the early part of 1831, when thirty-two years of age, since "Louis
Lambert" (which was undoubtedly conceived immediately after
illumination) was written in 1832. By 1833, when he was thirty-four
years of age, he had entered into full possession of his true life, a
presentiment of which had dominated him from early boyhood.

Madame Surville says: "It was not until 1833, about the time of the
publication of the "Médecin de Campagne," that he first thought of
collecting all his personages together and forming a complete society.
The day when this idea burst upon his mind was a glorious day for him.
He started from the Rue Cassini, where he had taken up his abode after
leaving the Rue de Tournon, and rushed to the faubourg Poissonniere,
where I was then living.

"'Make your bow to me,' he said to us, joyously; 'I am on the highroad
to become a genius!'

"He then unfolded his plan, which frightened him a little, for no matter
how vast his brain might be, it needed time to work out a scheme like
that.

"'How glorious it will be if I succeed,' he said, walking up and down
the room. He could not keep still; joy radiated from every feature.
'I'll willingly let them call me a maker of tales, all the while that I
am cutting stones for my edifice. I gloat in advance over the
astonishment of those nearsighted creatures as they see it rise'" \[4:
83\].

It seems likely, judging from Madame Surville's report, that Balzac was
either in the state of Cosmic Consciousness during this visit to her, or
had recently been so.

A writer already quoted \[106:87\] describes, no doubt correctly, in the
following words, what Balzac's scheme now was, and it is worth noting
that to all intents and purposes it was the same

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

as that conceived and attempted (each for his own world) by Dante,
"Shakespeare" and Whitman:

"Balzac proposed to himself to illustrate by a tale or a group of tales
every phase of French life and manners during the first half of the
nineteenth century. To be colossally and exhaustively complete—complete
not only in the generals but in the particulars—to touch upon every
salient point, to illuminate every typical feature, to reproduce every
sentiment, every idea, every person, every place, every object, that has
played a part, however minute, however obscure, in the life of the
French people."

Here is a description of him in the early thirties by Lamartine:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Balzac was standing before the fireplace of that dear room where I have
seen so many remarkable men and women come and go. He was not tall,
though the light on his face and the mobility of his figure prevented me
from noticing his stature. His body swayed with his thought; there
seemed at times to be a space between him and the floor; occasionally he
stooped as though to gather an idea at his feet, and then he rose on
them to follow the flight of his thought above him. At the moment of my
entrance he was carried away by the subject of a conversation then going
on with Monsieur and Madame de Girardin, and only interrupted himself
for a moment to give me a keen, rapid, gracious look of extreme
kindness.

He was stout, solid, square at the base and across the shoulders. The
neck, chest, body and thighs were powerful, with something of Mirabeau's
amplitude, but without heaviness. His soul was apparent, and seemed to
carry everything lightly, gaily, like a supple covering, not in the
least like a burden. His size seemed to give him power, not to deprive
him of it. His short arms gesticulated easily; he talked as an orator
speaks. His voice resounded with the somewhat vehement energy of his
lungs, but it had neither roughness nor sarcasm nor anger in it; his
legs, on which he rather swayed himself, bore the torso easily; his
hands, which were large and plump, expressed his thought as he waved
them. Such was the outward man in that robust frame. But in presence of
the face it was difficult to think of the structure. That speaking face,
from which it was not easy to remove one's eye, charmed and fascinated
you; his hair was worn in thick masses; his black eyes pierced you like
darts dipped in kindliness; they entered confidingly into yours like
friends. His cheeks were full and ruddy; the nose well modeled, though
rather long; the lips finely outlined, but full and raised at the
corners; the teeth irregular and notched. His head was apt to lean to
one side, and then, when the talk excited him, it was lifted quickly
with an heroic sort of pride.

But the dominant expression of his face, greater than even that of
intellect, was the manifestation of goodness and kindheartedness. He won
your mind

</div>

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

when he spoke, but he won your heart when he was silent. No feeling of
envy or hatred could have been expressed by that face; it was impossible
that it should seem otherwise than kind. But the kindness was not that
of indifference; it was loving kindness, conscious of its meaning and
conscious of others; it inspired gratitude and frankness, and defied all
those who knew him not to love him. A childlike merriment was in his
aspect; here was a soul at play; he had dropped his pen to be happy
among friends, and it was impossible not to be joyous where he was
\[4:123:5\].

</div>

It has been said of Balzac: "He was an illumination thrown upon life."

He was an illustration of his own dictum: "All we are is in the soul"
("nous ne sommes que par l’aine"), and a question of his to a friend
touches closely upon the thesis of this volume:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Are you certain \[he said\] that your soul has had its full development?
Do you breathe in air through every pore of it? Do your eyes see all
they can see \[4:126\].[\*](cc21.htm#an_204-1.md)

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_204-1">\*</span>This recalls Whitman 's: ''The eyesight has
another eyesight, and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another
voice" \[193: 342\].

</div>

A glance at a few of his letters to an intimate friend at the period
will throw light on our present inquiry:

"August, 1833. The 'Médecin de Campagne' will reach you next week. It
has cost me ten times the work that 'Louis Lambert' did. There is not a
sentence, not an idea, which has not been viewed and reviewed, read and
reread, and corrected; the labor was frightful. I may now die in peace.
I have done a great work for my country. To my mind it is better to have
written this book than to have made laws and to have won battles. It is
the gospel in action" \[4: 143\].

"October, 1833. Do you know how the 'Médecin' has been received? By a
torrent of insults. The three newspapers of my own party which have
spoken of it have done so with the utmost contempt for the work and its
author" \[4: 143\].

"December, 1835. Never has the torrent which bears me onward been so
rapid; no more terribly majestic work has ever compelled the human
brain. I go to my toil as a gambler to cards. I sleep only five hours
and work eighteen; I shall end by killing myself" \[4: 145\].

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Like all men of his class—i.e., like all men glorified by the divine
spark which is the subject of this poor volume—Balzac was greatly loved
by those who were brought in contact with him.

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

His servants loved him. Rose, the cook, a true cordon bleu (we called
her La Grande Nanon), used to go into despair when her master, in his
working months, neglected her dainty dishes. I have seen her come into
his room on tiptoe, bringing a delicious consommé, and trembling with
eagerness to see him drink it. Balzac would catch sight of her; perhaps
the fumes of the soup would reach his olfactories; then he would toss
back his mane of hair with an impatient jerk of his head, and exclaim in
his roughest and most surly voice: "Rose, go away; I don't want
anything; let me alone!" "But mossieu will ruin his health if he goes on
in this way; mossieu will fall ill!" "No, no! Let me alone, I say!" in a
thundering voice. "I don't want anything; you worry me; go away!" Then
the good soul would turn to go slowly, very slowly, muttering: "To take
such pains to please mossieu! and such a soup—how good it smells! Why
should mossieu keep me in his service if he doesn't want what I do for
him?" This was too much for Balzac. He called her back, drank the soup
at a gulp and said in his kindest voice, as she went off radiant to her
kitchen: "Now, Rose, don't let this happen again!" When his microscopic
groom, a poor little orphan whom he called Gain de mil, died, Balzac
took extreme care of him, and never failed to go and see him daily
during his illness. Yes, God had given my great writer a heart of gold;
and those who really knew him adored him. He possessed the art of making
others love him to such a degree that in his presence they forgot any
real or fancied complaint against him, and only remembered the affection
they bore him \[4: 162–3\].

</div>

It has been said: "Few writers have been greater than Balzac in the
exhibition of the moral qualities." But says Goethe: "Wenn ihr nicht
füllt ihr Werdet's nicht erjagen." If a man is destitute of a given
faculty it is useless for him to attempt to describe it.

How is it that, as Hugo says, "A genius is an accursed man?" That the
men having the greatest qualities are precisely those men who are
accredited with the absence of these? And, to come back to Balzac, why
should it be doubted that this man—who gave *every* proof of moral
greatness—was great by his moral as well as his intellectual qualities?
Simply because it is easier to misunderstand than to understand men of
his class, and because when we do not understand we incline to infer the
worst rather than the best.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

The *fact* is, as has been said: "Balzac is a moralist, the greatest
moralist of the nineteenth century, one who does not preach but shows
the truth" \[4: 178\].

So Bacon, although in his prose works he may be said to *preach*, yet
these works were intended as merely introductory to others which were to
*show* the truth. In the "Plan" of his life work, the "Instauratio
Magna," he divides this last into six parts: (I) The division of the
sciences, represented by the "De Augmentis"; (II) "The New Organon";
(III) "The Phenomena of the Universe," represented by his natural
history books; (IV) "The Ladder of the Intellect," represented by the
"Comedies"; (V) "The Forerunners," represented by the "Histories," and
(VI) "The New Philosophy," represented by the "Tragedies."

Speaking now \[34: 51\] of IV (the "Comedies"), and describing the aim
of that part, he says that this does not consist of precepts and rules
(for, he says, I have given plenty of these in the "Novum Organum"), but
of actual "types and models" by which those things which are to be
taught are "set as it were before the eyes." Then of VI (the
"Tragedies") he says that this part consists not in "mere felicity of
speculation," but that it presents (as we know it does) "the real
business and fortunes of the human race." "For God forbid," he
continues, "that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a
pattern of the world; rather may he graciously grant to us to write an
apocalypse or true vision of the footsteps of the Creator imprinted on
his creatures." Neither did Jesus, nor Whitman, nor any of these men,
preach, but they all showed the truth, each in his own way, in his life
and in his spoken or written word.

Another trait that seems common to these men—absorption in their own
time—has been noted of Balzac. Theophile Gautier dwells at length on
what he calls the absolute modernity of Balzac's genius. "Balzac owes
nothing," he says, "to antiquity. For him there are neither Greeks nor
Romans, nor any trace in the composition of his talent of Homer, or
Virgil, or Horace—no one was ever less classic" \[4: 170\].

"One might suppose that his feelings would have been hurt

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

when he found the way barred against his entrance to the Academy. But he
behaved with dignity and withdrew his name when failure seemed probable.
'The matter does not stir my feelings very much,' he said; 'some persons
think not at all, but they are mistaken. If I do get there, so much the
better; if I do not, no matter'" \[4: 190\].

George Sand bears witness of him as follows:

"He searched for treasures and found none but those he bore within
him—his intellect, his spirit of observation, his marvellous capacity,
his strength, his gaiety, his goodness of heart—in a word, his genius."

"Sober in all respects, his morals were pure; he dreaded excesses as the
death of talent; he cherished women by his heart or his head, and his
life from early youth was that of an anchorite" \[4: 201\].

"He has seen all and said all, comprehended all and divined all—how,
then, can he be immoral? . . .

"Balzac has been reproached for having no principles because he has, as
I think, no positive convictions on questions of fact in religion, art,
politics or even love" \[4: 203\].

This is a highly significant statement. Every one of these people has
been judged in the same way by contemporaries. Why? Because they *have*
no opinions or principles in the sense in which their neighbors have
them. The things that seem vital to those about them seem to them of no
import. And the things that are of value to them are out of sight of the
rest.

Here is Gautier's evidence as to the kind of man he was (it ought to be
quoted in full, but that is impossible in this place):

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

When I saw Balzac for the first time he was about thirty-six, and his
personality was one of those that are never forgotten. In his presence
Shakespeare's words came to my memory—before him "nature might stand up
and say to all the world: This was a man." He wore the monk's habit of
white flannel or cashmere, in which, some time later, he made Louis
Boulanger paint him. What fancy had led him to choose, in preference to
all other costumes, this particular one, which he always wore, I do not
know. Perhaps it symbolized to his eyes the cloistral life to which his
work condemned him; and,

</div>

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

benedictine of romance, he wore the robe. However that may be, it became
him wonderfully.

</div>

He boasted, .showing me his spotless sleeves, that he never dropped the
least spot of ink upon it; "for," he added, "a true literary man ought
to be clean at his work."

Then, after describing other features, Gautier goes on:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

As to his eyes, there were never any like them; they had a life, a
light, an inconceivable magnetism; the whites of the eyeballs was pure,
limpid, with a bluish tinge, like that of an infant or a virgin,
enclosing two black diamonds, dashed at moments with gold
reflections—eyes to make an eagle drop his lids—eyes to read through
walls and into bosoms or to terrify a furious wild beast—the eyes of a
sovereign, a seer, a subjugator. The habitual expression of the face was
that of puissant hilarity, of Rabelaisian and monachal joy.

Strange as it may seem to say so in the nineteenth century, Balzac was a
seer. His power as an observer, his discernment as a physiologist, his
genius as a writer, do not sufficiently account for the infinite variety
of the two or three thousand types which play a rôle more or less
important in his human comedy. He did not copy them: he lived them
ideally. He wore their clothes, contracted their habits, moved in their
surroundings, *was themselves*, during the necessary time \[4:204–8\].

</div>

As another man of the same class says of himself: "I am a free
companion." "My voice is the wife's voice." "I am the hounded slave." "I
am an old Artillerist." "I am the mashed fireman." "It is I let out in
the morning and barred at night." "Not a youngster is taken for larceny
but I go up, too, and am tried and sentenced." "Not a cholera patient
lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp. My face is ash
colored, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat." "Askers embody
themselves in me and I am embodied in them. I project my hat, sit
shamefaced and beg." Gautier goes on:

And yet Balzac, immense in brain, penetrating physiologist, profound
observer, intuitive spirit, did not possess the literary gift. In him
yawned an abyss between thought and form \[4: 209\].

Here is a curious thing. How is it that these men who form the mind of
the race can seldom or never (at least according to their
contemporaries) write their own language decently According to Renan
(and he does not seem to be contradicted) Paul's

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

style was about as bad as possible ("sans charme; la forme, en est apre
est presvue toujour dénuée de grace") \[143: 568\].

Mohammed can hardly be said to have written, and in his day and country
there was no recognized standard with which to compare his language. The
author of the "Shakespeare" drama was for long ranked as a writer below
the meanest pamphleteer. And down to the present moment scarcely a man
has defended Walt Whitman from the purely literary point of view, while
thousands have utterly condemned him.

But the writings of Paul dominate whole continents. Mohammed's
utterances hold in spiritual subjection two hundred millions of people.
The author of "Hamlet" has been called, and rightly called, "The Lord of
Civilization." And Walt Whitman's will probably eventually be seen to be
the strongest voice of the nineteenth century.

The seeming anomaly is perhaps easily explained. In each generation
there are certain men, who are never large in number, who possess the
literary instinct, and there are also certain men who are endowed with
Cosmic Consciousness, but there is no reason whatever why the two
endowments should unite. If they do so it is a mere accident. The man
with the literary instinct writes for the sake of writing. He feels that
he has the faculty, and, looking about for a subject, or for one subject
after another, he writes upon it or them. The man endowed with Cosmic
Consciousness has almost certainly no literary instinct (the chance is
millions to one against it), but he sees certain things which he feels
he must tell. He simply, with might and main, does the best he can. The
importance of his message causes him to be read. His personality, as it
becomes recognized, causes everything in immediate connection with him
to be admired, and in the end he is perhaps held up as a model of style.

Madame Surville continuing, says: "The attacks against my brother
increased rather than lessened; the critics, unable to repeat the same
things forever, changed their batteries and accused him of immorality.
These accusations were very injurious to my brother; they grieved him
deeply, and sometimes they disheartened

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

him" \[4: 242\]. The old, old story, but never worn out, never
threadbare, always as ready for service, as fresh and, alas! as fatal as
ever.

The foregoing few brief extracts suggest the kind of man Balzac was as
seen from the outside. It is clear from them, to any one in a position
to judge, that he was such a person as might very probably be so
endowed, and it only remains to show from his own words—words that could
not otherwise have been written—that he was really one of the
illuminati—a man possessing the rare and splendid faculty called Cosmic
Consciousness.

And first a few short extracts, written by Balzac of himself, and which
give us glimpses of the inner man before the oncoming of the Cosmic
Sense.

It will be noticed that he, like all men of the class to which he
belongs, was religious, though not quite in the orthodox way; these men
seldom adhere to a church. A "specialist" may *found* a religion; he
seldom belongs to one. "Specialists" are for *religion*, not for *a
religion*. So Balzac tells us of himself, under the name of "Louis
Lambert:"

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Though naturally religious, he did not share in the minute observances
of the Roman Church; his ideas were more particularly in sympathy with
those of St. Theresa, Fénelon, several of the fathers and a few saints,
who would be treated in our day as heretics or atheists. He was unmoved
during the church services. Prayer, with him, proceeded from an impulse,
a movement, an elevation of the spirit, which followed no regular
course; in all things he gave himself up to nature, and would neither
pray nor think at settled periods \[5:73\].

The limit which most brains attain was the point of departure from which
his was one day to start in search of new regions of intelligence
\[5:79\].

</div>

Later he makes this remark about himself:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

The seed has swelled and germinated. Philosophers may regret the
foliage, struck with frost ere it burgeoned, but they shall one day see
the perfect flower blooming in regions higher far than the highest
places of the earth \[5: 84\].

</div>

In his further fragmentary, veiled and mystic narration of the actual
oncoming of the Cosmic Sense, it is important, for the present argument,
to notice that: (*a*) He had no idea what had happened to him. (*b*) He
was seized with terror \[5: 129\]. (*c*) He

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

debated seriously with himself whether he was not insane. (*d*) He
considers (or reconsiders) the question of marriage—doubts that it will
be "an obstacle to the perfectability of his interior senses and to his
flight through the spiritual worlds" \[5:131\] and seems to decide
against it. And, in fact, when we consider the antagonistic attitude of
so many of the great cases toward this relation (Gautama, Jesus, Paul,
Whitman, etc.), there seems little doubt that anything like a general
possession of Cosmic Consciousness must abolish marriage as we know it

Balzac must have attained to Cosmic Consciousness about 1831 or 1832, at
the age of thirty-two or thirty-three. It was at this time he began
writing his great books. But it is especially important at present to
note that in 1832 he wrote "Louis Lambert" and in 1833 "Seraphita."

In these two books he describes the new sense more fully than it had
ever been described elsewhere. In "Louis Lambert" he gives a bold, plain
common sense description of it which is especially valuable for our
present purpose. Then the next year, after writing that work, he
composed "Seraphita," the object of which was to delineate a person who
was possessed of the great faculty. The two taken together prove the
possession of the faculty by their author. "Seraphita" must be read
entire to be understood and appreciated, and so, of course, ought "Louis
Lambert"; but the evidence now needed may be obtained from the latter
within the compass of a few pages. The extracts are from A. P. Wormley's
translation, which has been compared with the original and found
faithful.

The world of ideas divides itself into three spheres—that of instinct;
that of abstraction; that of specialism \[5: 141\].

The greater part of visible humanity—that is, the weaker part—inhabits
the sphere of instinctivity. The instinctives

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

There are in the intellect three stages—simple consciousness, self
consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness.

It is, of course, not true that the bulk of the race has simple and not
self consciousness. It is in fact the latter that constitutes a given
creature a man. But it is true <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> (what
Balzac means) that with the mass simple consciousness plays a far
greater part than self consciousness. The "weaker part" do live in
simple far more than in self consciousness.

</div>

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

are born, work and die without rising to the second degree of human
intelligence—namely, abstraction \[5: 142\].

At abstraction society[\*](cc21.htm#an_212-1.md) begins. Though abstraction
as compared with instinct is an almost divine power, it is infinitely
feeble compared with the endowment of specialism, which alone can
explain God. Abstraction comprises within it a whole nature in germ, as
potentially as the seed contains the system of a plant and all its
products. From abstraction are derived laws, arts, interests, social
ideas. It is the glory and scourge of the world. Glorious, it creates
societies; baneful, it exempts man from entering the path of specialism
which leads to the infinite. Man judges all things by his
abstractions—good, evil, virtue, crime. His formulas of right are his
scales, and his justice is blind; the justice of God sees—in that is
everything. There are, necessarily, intermediate beings who separate the
kingdom of instinctives from the kingdom of the abstractives, in whom
instinctivity mixes with abstractivity in endless variety of proportion.
Some have more of the former than of the latter, and vice versa. Also
there are beings in whom the action of each is neutralized, because both
are moved by an equal force \[5:142\].

[\*](cc21.htm#an_212-2.md) Specialism consists in seeing the things of the
material world as well as those of the spiritual world in their original
and consequential ramifications. The highest human genius is that which
starts from the shadows of abstraction to advance into the light of
specialism. (Specialism, species, sight, speculation, seeing all, and
that at one glance; speculum, the mirror or means of estimating a thing
by seeing it in its entirety). Jesus was a specialist. He saw the deed
in its roots and in its products; in the past, which begot it; in the
present, where it is manifested; in the future, where it
develops;[\*](cc21.htm#an_212-3.md) his sight penetrated the understanding
of others. The perfection of the inward sight gives birth to the gift of
specialism. Specialism carries with it intuition. Intuition is a faculty
of the inner man, of whom specialism is an attribute.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_212-1">\*</span> At abstraction—i.e., at self
consciousness—humanity, and therefore human society, begins. "Specialism
alone can explain God." Let it be noted in this connection that all
religion worthy of the name—Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Christianity and
possibly others—has sprung from specialism—i.e., Cosmic Consciousness.
"I" \[Christ, Cosmic Sense\] "am the way, the truth and the life, no one
comes to God but by me." It is not so clear how self consciousness bars
the way to Cosmic Consciousness. It seems, on the contrary, the
necessary and only road which could lead there. Many of the illuminated,
however, take the same view as Balzac, and they ought to be the best
judges.

<span id="an_212-2">\*</span> Note that Balzac is only speaking of
Cosmic Consciousness from the point of view of "ideas." He therefore
does not tell us here of the moral exaltation which is an essential part
of it. He gives that aspect, however, very fully in "Seraphita."

<span id="an_212-3">\*</span> As says Dante: "Even as earthly minds see
that two obtuse angles are not contained in a triangle, so thou \[the
Cosmic Sense\], gazing upon the point to which all times are present,
seest contingent things ere in themselves they are" \[72: 111.\]

</div>

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

[\*](cc21.htm#an_213-1.md) Between the sphere of specialism and the sphere
of abstraction, and likewise between those spheres and that of
instinctivity, we find beings in whom the diverse attributes of the two
kingdoms are mingled, producing a mixed nature—the man of genius
\[5:143\].

[\*](cc21.htm#an_213-2.md) The specialist is necessarily the loftiest
expression of man—the link which connects the visible to the superior
worlds. He acts, he sees, he feels through his *inner being*. The
abstractive thinks. The instinctive simply acts \[5:144\].

[\*](cc21.htm#an_213-3.md) Hence three degrees for man. As an instinctive
he is below the level; as an abstractive he attains to it; as a
specialist he rises above it. Specialism opens to man his true career:
the Infinite dawns upon him—he catches a glimpse of his destiny \[5:
144\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_213-1">\*</span> "Natura non facit saltum:" There must be a
gradual passage from simple to self and from self to Cosmic
Consciousness—i.e., there must be a way of passing gradually.
Nevertheless nothing is more sure than that the passage from simple to
self and from self to Cosmic Consciousness is commonly made with a
sudden and often terribly startling jump. But that the conditions may
not blend and overlap one another, as Balzac says, it would be well not
to be too positive.

<span id="an_213-2">\*</span> The state of Cosmic Consciousness is
undoubtedly the highest that we can at present conceive, but it does not
follow that there are not higher nor that we may not eventually attain
to higher.

<span id="an_213-3">\*</span> With simple consciousness only man is not
yet man—he is the alalus homo. With self consciousness he is what we
know him-With Cosmic Consciousness he is as we sea him (or rather do not
see him; for who of us really sees these men?) in Jesus, Mohammed,
Balzac, Whitman. When the race shall have attained to Cosmic
Consciousness, as in the far past it attained to self consciousness,
another start will be made on another level. Man will enter into his
heritage and into his true work.

</div>

Balzac proceeds as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

[\*](cc21.htm#an_213-4.md) There exists three worlds—the *natural world*,
the *spiritual world*, the *divine world*. Humanity moves hither and
thither in the *natural world*, which is fixed neither in its essence
nor in its properties. The *spiritual world* is fixed in its essence and
variable in its properties. The *divine world* is fixed in its
properties and its essence. Consequently there is a material worship, a
spiritual worship, a divine worship; which three are manifested by
*action*, *word* and *prayer*, or (to express it otherwise) *deed*,
*understanding*, *love*. The *instinctive* desires deeds; the
abstractive turns to ideas; the *specialist* sees the end, he aspires to
God, whom <span id="page_214">p. 214</span> he inwardly perceives or
contemplate. \[5:144\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_213-4">\*</span> In other words: The men who live entirely
or almost entirely in simple consciousness float on the stream of time
as do the animals—drift with the seasons, the food supply, etc., etc.,
as a leaf drifts on a current, not self-moved or self-balanced, but
moved by outer influences and balanced by the natural forces as are the
animals and the trees. The fully self-conscious man takes stock of
himself and is, so to say, self-centered. He feels that he is a fixed
point. He judges all things with reference to that point. But outside of
himself (we know) there is nothing fixed. He trusts in what he calls God
and he does not trust in him—he is a deist, an atheist, a Christian, a
Buddhist. He believes in science, but science is constantly changing and
will rarely tell him, in any case, anything worth knowing. He is fixed,
then, at one point and moves freely on that. The man with Cosmic
Consciousness

</div>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

being conscious of himself and conscious of the Cosmos, its meaning and
drift, is fixed both without and within, "in his essence and in his
properties." The creature with simple consciousness only is a straw
floating on a tide, it moves freely with every influence. The
self-conscious man is a needle pivoted by its centre—fixed in one point
but revolving freely on that. The man with Cosmic Consciousness is the
same needle magnetized. It is still fixed by its centre, but besides
that it points steadily to the north—it has found something real and
permanent outside of itself toward which it cannot but steadily look.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

[\*](cc21.htm#an_214-1.md) Therefore perhaps one day the inverse sense of
*et verbo caro factum* will be the epitome of a new gospel which will
read: *and the flesh shall be made the word;* it shall become the
utterance of God \[5:145\].

[\*](cc21.htm#an_214-2.md) The "resurrection" is not of the so-called dead,
but of the living who are "dead" in the sense of never having entered
upon true life.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_214-1">\*</span> When the whole race shall have attained to
Cosmic Consciousness our idea of God shall be realized in man.

<span id="an_214-2">\*</span> The resurrection is brought about by the
winds of heaven which sweep the worlds. The angel born upon the blast
saith not: "Ye Dead, arise;" he saith, "Arise, ye living" \[5:145\].

#### III.

#### SUMMARY OF THE CASE OF BALZAC.

*a*. We do not know of any day and hour when the Cosmic Sense declared
itself.

*b*. We know nothing about a subjective light.

*c*. We know that Balzac had the intensely earnest nature and the
spiritual aspiration which seems necessarily to precede, though it often
exists without leading up to, illumination.

*d*. We know that Balzac, after a certain age, had the almost
preternatural intellectual and moral qualities which are characteristic
of the Cosmic Sense.

*e*. But the proof that Balzac was a case of Cosmic Consciousness rests
upon the fact that he has accurately defined and described the mental
status so named, and he could not have described the condition if he had
not experienced it.

*f*. He not only describes it in great detail, as in "Louis Lambert,"
and ascribes it there to himself—for that book is openly

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

autobiographic; but still more, in "Seraphita" he creates a personality
in which the Cosmic Sense is the chief element and in the course of the
narrative brings in every characteristic feature of the same, and to do
this the possession of the Cosmic Sense was an absolute prerequisite.

*g*. To any one who realizes what the Cosmic Sense is it is as certain
that Balzac possessed it as that he possessed eyesight.
