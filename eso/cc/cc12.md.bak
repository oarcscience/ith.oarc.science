### CHAPTER 3.

*Paul*.

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> the great apostle had the Cosmic
Sense seems as clear and certain as that Cæsar was a great general.

He was, in fact, "great" and an "apostle" because he had it, and for no
other reason whatever.

##### I.

In his case meet all the elements both of probability and proof. As
shown by his enthusiasm for the religion in which he was brought up, he
had the earnest temperament which seems always to form the matrix in
which the new life is brought forward to its birth. He was at the time
of his (supposed) illumination probably about the age at which the
Cosmic Sense usually shows itself. Sutherland (171: 137) has the
following bearing on this point: He says that Paul:

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Could not have been very much younger than Jesus. He was of an ardent
and impetuous nature, and not long after the crucifixion (perhaps within
two years) began to be conspicuous as a persecutor of the little
companies of believers in Christ that were gathered not only in
Jerusalem but in many other places. The same zeal which made him
afterward such an efficient missionary of Christianity now caused him to
carry his persecutions of the hated sect of the "Nazarenes" beyond
Jerusalem to the cities and villages of Judea, and finally even beyond
the bounds of Palestine. It was while he was on his way to the city of
Damascus, a little way outside of Palestine on the northeast, bent on
extirpating the new heresy there, that the remarkable event occurred
which changed his whole life.

</div>

If, now, Paul was, say, four or five years younger than Jesus, his
illumination took place at the same age as that of his great
predecessor.

One word more on this last point. It is a little singular that neither
the apostle himself nor his historian, Luke, who was deeply interested
in all that related to his personality, have let fall a single
expression from which the date of Paul's birth can be positively and
definitely deduced. Speaking of his life before his illumination,
however, Paul says \[18:22:4\]: "I persecuted this way unto the death,
binding and delivering into prison both men and women." A very young
man, unless born into some place of authority, could hardly have
occupied the position thus described. The leaders of the chief party of
the Jews would scarcely employ a very young man as Paul was employed.
Paul's "conversion" possibly took place in the year 33 \[144: 45–6\].
Supposing he was born shortly before the year 1, then when Philippians
was written—that is, A. D. 61 \[144: 357–8\]—he would be between sixty
and sixty-five years of age, which would agree very well with certain
expressions in that epistle which would hardly have been uttered by a
much younger man. For instance: "I am in a strait betwixt the two,
having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far
better: yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake" \[24:1:
23–4\]. When writing these words it does not appear that he was sick,
neither was he in any danger from the result of his trial, which was
then going on \[144: 357–8\]. The near prospect of death must have been
due to his age at the time. But if he was, say, sixty-five in A. D. 61,
then he would be thirty-seven at

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the time of his illumination. He might not have been as old as that, but
could hardly have been much younger.

The chronology of the early church is very obscure. Renan \[142: 163\]
gives the date of Paul's birth 10 or 12 A. D., that of the stoning of
Stephen 37, that of Paul's "conversion" 38. Paul, then, would have been
between twenty-six and twenty-eight on the occurrence of that event;
also he would have been no more than forty-nine to fifty-one when the
above passage in Philippians was written. But this, for reasons given,
seems exceedingly unlikely. Weighing all probabilities (for we have
nothing else) it seems likely that Paul was about four years younger
than Jesus and that his illumination took place about the same length of
time after that of his great predecessor.

##### II.

We have three separate accounts of the oncoming of his new life, two of
them ostensibly and probably in his own words, and each of the three
containing the essential elements of the fact of illumination as
positively known in other cases. Again we have elsewhere \[21:12:1–7\] a
description, certainly given by himself, of certain subjective
experiences which would alone be strong, if not convincing, evidence of
the fact of illumination; for it is safe to say that the words there set
down could hardly have been written unless the writer of them had
actually experienced the passage from self to Cosmic Consciousness. Then
over and above all these evidences there exists a body of writings by
this man which over and over again demonstrates the existence in the
writer of the faculty in question. His conduct immediately following
illumination is also characteristic. Taking the usual course, he retires
for some time into more or less complete solitude; whether to the
Hauran, as Renan supposes, or to the Sinaitic peninsula, as Holsten
thinks, does not matter \[84: 417\]. As regards his illumination
itself—his "conversion," the oncoming of Cosmic Consciousness in his
case—we are told \[18: 9: 3–9\] that:

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

As he journeyed it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and
suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven: and he fell
upon the earth and heard a voice saying unto him, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span> And he said, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">I
am Jesus whom thou persecutest: but rise and enter into the city, and it
shall be told thee what thou must do</span>. And the men that journeyed
with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man. And
Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw
nothing; and they led him by the hand into Damascus. And he was three
days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.

</div>

The second account runs as follows \[18: 22: 6–11\]:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

And it came to pass, that as I made my journey, and drew nigh unto
Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light
round about me. And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying
unto me, maul, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Saul,
Saul, why persecutest thou me?</span> And I answered, Who art thou,
Lord? And he said unto me, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">I
am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest:</span> And they that were
with me beheld indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him
that spake to me. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said
unto me, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Arise,
and go into Damascus. And there it shall be told thee of all things
which are appointed for thee to do.</span> And when I could not see for
the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with
me, I came into Damascus.

</div>

And the third account \[18: 26: 12–18\] is as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

As I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the
chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven,
above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them that
journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth I heard a
voice saying unto me in the Hebrew language, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Saul,
Saul why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the
goad.</span> And I said, Who art thou, Lord! And the Lord, said, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">I
am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But arise and stand upon thy feet; for
to this end have I appeared unto thee, to appoint thee a minister and a
witness both of the things wherein thou has seen me, and of things
wherein I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people and
from the Gentiles, unto whom I send thee, to open their eyes, that they
may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto
God.</span>

</div>

These three narratives, which agree well enough one with another, their
slight discrepancies being of little or no consequence, give the usual
sensuous phenomena that nearly always accompany the oncoming of the new
sense.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

Next comes a recital of even, if possible, still greater importance
\[21: 12: 1–7\]. It conveys, in few words, an account of Paul's moral
elevation and intellectual illumination during and following his
"conversion." He says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to
visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in
Christ,[\*](cc12.htm#an_115-1.md) fourteen years ago (whether in the body I
know not or whether out of the body I know not; God knoweth) such a one
caught up even to the third heaven. And I know such a man (whether in
the body or apart from the body I know not; God knoweth) how that he was
caught up into paradise and heard *unspeakable
words*,[†](cc12.htm#an_115-2.md) which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
On behalf of such a one will I glory; but on mine own behalf I will not
glory, save in my weaknesses. For if I should desire to glory I shall
not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth; but I forbear, lest any man
should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from
me. And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the
revelations—wherefore that I should not be exalted overmuch there was
given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_115-1">\*</span> "Christ" is Paul's name for Cosmic
Consciousness.

<span id="an_115-2">†</span> *Unspeakable words*, so Whitman: "When I
undertake to tell the best I find I cannot, my tongue is ineffectual on
its pivots; my breath will not be obedient to its organs; I become a
dumb man" \[193: 179\].

</div>

### III.

To complete the case it only remains to transcribe certain utterances of
Paul's from the point of view of the Cosmic Sense; which utterances, did
they stand alone, would prove that the man from whom they proceeded
possessed it, since without it they could not have been made.

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,[\*](cc12.htm#an_115-3.md)
that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of the Lord, shall
in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep. For the Lord himself
shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the
archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first: Then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them
be caught up in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we
ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words
\[26:4:15–18\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_115-3">\*</span> The usual assurances of immortality that
belong to Cosmic Consciousness.

</div>

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

For I make known to you, brethren,[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-1.md) as touching
the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man. For
neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to
me through revelation of Jesus Christ \[22:1:
11–12\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-2.md)

But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my
mother's womb, and called me through His grace to reveal His Son in

me, that I might preach him among the gentiles; immediately I conferred
not with flesh and blood; neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which
were apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia; and again I
returned unto Damascus \[22: 1: 15–17\].

Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
\[22:3:13\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-3.md) But before faith came, we were kept
inward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be
revealed. So that the law has been our tutor to bring us unto Christ
that we might be justified by faith; but now that faith is come we are
no longer under a tutor. For ye are all sons of God through faith in
Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptised into Christ did put on
Christ \[22:3:23–27\].

With freedom did Christ set us free[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-4.md) \[22:5:1\].

For ye, brethren, [\*](cc12.htm#an_116-5.md) were called for freedom
\[22:5:13\].

The fruit of the spirit[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-6.md) is love, joy, peace, long
suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, temperance:
against such as these there is no law. And they that are of Christ Jesus
have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof \[22:5:
22–24\].

Neither is circumcision[\*](cc12.htm#an_116-7.md) anything, nor
uncircumcision, but a new creature \[22:6:15\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_116-1">\*</span> As regards his "Gospel," Paul was
instructed by the Cosmic Sense only.

<span id="an_116-2">\*</span> He knew, however, enough about Jesus and
his teachings to be able to recognize (when it came to him) that the
teachings of the Cosmic Sense were practically identical with the
teachings of Jesus.

<span id="an_116-3">\*</span> Christ is the Cosmic Sense conceived as a
distinct entity or individuality. That does redeem any to whom it comes
from the "curse of the law"—i.e., from the shame and fear and hate that
belong to the self conscious life. Paul seems to suppose a baptism into
Cosmic Consciousness (Christ) . Doubtless there is such a baptism; but
where is the priesthood which is able to administer it?

<span id="an_116-4">\*</span> The ''freedom" of the Cosmic Sense is
supreme. It absolves a man from his former self and makes future slavery
impossible.

<span id="an_116-5">\*</span> Paul loves and values freedom as keenly as
does the modern American Walt Whitman. They both knew (what, alas! so
few have known) what true freedom is.

<span id="an_116-6">\*</span> For "The Spirit" and "Christ Jesus" read
Cosmic Consciousness. Cf. M. C. L. infra. "The holy breath kills lust,
etc.," and Bhagavadgita: "Even the taste for objects of sense departs
from him who has seen the supreme."

<span id="an_116-7">\*</span> Called by Balzac: "The second existence"
\[5: 100\].

</div>

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

We speak wisdom among the perfect:[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-1.md) yet a wisdom
not of this world, nor of the rulers of this world, which are coming to
nought; but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that
hath been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds unto our
glory: which none of the rulers of this world knoweth \[20:2:6–8\].

The spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-2.md) For who among men knoweth the things of a
man, save the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the things of
God none knoweth, save the spirit of God. But we received, not the
spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know
the things that are freely given to us by God. Which things also we
speak, not in words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the spirit
teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Now the natural man
receiveth not the things of the spirit of God: For they are foolishness
unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually judged.
But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of
no man. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct
him? But we have the mind of Christ.[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-3.md) And I,
brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, as unto babes in Christ. I fed you with milk, not with meat; for
ye were not yet able to bear it; nay, not even now-are ye able; for ye
are yet carnal \[20: 2: 10–16 and 3:1–3\].

If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him
become a fool, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God \[20:3:18–19\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-4.md)

If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall
reap your carnal things \[20:9: 11\]?[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-5.md)

For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is
laid upon me \[20:9:16\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_117-6.md)

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_117-1">\*</span> He speaks from the standpoint of the
Cosmic Sense, which was to come when the time was ripe and has come now
to him.

<span id="an_117-2">\*</span> Paul is informed, not by the human (the
self conscious) mind, but by the spirit of God (Cosmic Consciousness),
and no man merely self conscious can judge him any more than an animal
(having simple consciousness merely) can judge a (self conscious) man.

<span id="an_117-3">\*</span> The merely self conscious man cannot be
made to understand the things seen by the Cosmic Sense. These things, if
presented, appear foolish to him. But he that has the Cosmic Sense
(being, of course, also self conscious) is able to judge "all
things"—i.e., the things of both regions. Paul could not therefore speak
to the Corinthians as he would have liked to have done, they not having
Cosmic Consciousness,

<span id="an_117-4">\*</span> Paul says the wisdom of self consciousness
is not wisdom to those who have the Cosmic Sense, and the wisdom of the
latter is foolishness to the merely self conscious.

<span id="an_117-5">\*</span> Compare Whitman's poem, "To Rich Givers"
\[193: 2161: "What you give me I cheerfully accept, a little sustenance,
a hut and garden, a little money as I rendezvous with my poems, a
traveler's lodging and a breakfast as I journey through the states. Why
should I be ashamed to own such gifts? Why to advertise for them? For I
myself am not one who bestows nothing upon man and woman, for I bestow
upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of the universe.

<span id="an_117-6">\*</span> This seems to be the experience of all
persons who have had the Cosmic Sense either in greater or less degree.
So Blake says: "I have written this poem ('Jerusalem') without
premeditation *and even* <span id="page_118">p. 118</span> *against my
will*." So also Behmen "became impressed with the necessity of writing
down what he saw," though writing was far from easy with him.

</div>

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,[\*](cc12.htm#an_118-1.md)
but have not love, I am become sounding brass, or a clanging cymbal. And
if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all
knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have
not love, I am nothing. And if I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profiteth me
nothing. Love suffereth long, and is kind; love envieth not; love
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, does not behave itself unseemly,
seeketh not its own, is not provoked, taketh not account of evil;
rejoiceth not in unrighteousness, but rejoiceth with the truth; beareth
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things. Love never faileth; but whether there be prophecies, they shall
be done away; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there
be knowledge, it shall be done away. For we know in part and we prophesy
in part; but when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part
shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I felt as a
child, I thought as a child; now that I am become a man, I have put away
childish things. For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to
face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I have been
known. But now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest
of these is love \[20: 13:1–13\].

For as in Adam all die,[\*](cc12.htm#an_118-2.md) so also in Christ shall
all be made alive. But each in his own order, Christ the first fruits;
then they that are Christ's, at his coming. Then cometh the end when he
shall deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have
abolished all rule and all authority and power \[20:15:22–25\].

Behold, I tell you a mystery:[\*](cc12.htm#an_118-3.md) We shall not all
sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trump. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall
be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible
must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, but
when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal
shall have put on

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_118-1">\*</span> A splendid exposition of the morality that
belongs to the Cosmic Sense. The same spirit may be traced in every
case—but see especially \[193: 273\]: "Give me the pay I have served
for, give me to sing the song of the great idea, take all the rest, I
have loved the earth, sun, animals, I have despised riches, I have given
alms to every one that asked, stood up for the stupid and crazy, devoted
my income and labor to others."

<span id="an_118-2">\*</span> A comparison between the self conscious
and the Cosmic Conscious states. Self Consciousness, he says, the Adamic
state, is a condition of death. With "Christ" begins true life, which
shall spread and become universal; that is the end of the old order.
After that there shall be no more "rule," "authority" or "power"; all
shall be free and equal. "The angel borne upon the blast saith not 'Ye
dead arise,' he saith 'Arise, ye living'" \[5: 145\].

<span id="an_118-3">\*</span> Expresses the sense of immortality which
belongs to Cosmic Consciousness. Compare \[193: 77\]: "There is that in
me—I do not know what it Is—but I know that it is in me. Wrenched and
sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes, I sleep, I sleep long. I do
not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid—it is not in any
dictionary, utterance, symbol. Something it swings on more than the
earth I swing on, to it the creation is the friend whose embracing
awakes me. Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers
and sisters. <span id="page_119">p. 119</span> Do you see, O my brothers
and sisters? It is not chaos or death, it is form, union, plan—it is
eternal life—it is happiness."

</div>

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death
is swallowed up in victory \[20:15:51–55\].

But though our outward man is decaying,[\*](cc12.htm#an_119-1.md) yet our
inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is for
the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight
of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the
things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal:
but the things which are not seen are eternal. For we know that if the
earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved we have a building from
God, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens. For verily in
this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is
from heaven; if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not
for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that
what is mortal may be swallowed up of life \[21:4: 16–18 and 5:1: 5\] .

If any man is in Christ he is a new creature; the old things are passed
away; behold, they are become new \[21:5:17\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_119-2.md)

There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus.[\*](cc12.htm#an_119-3.md) For the law of the Spirit of life in
Christ Jesus made me free from the law of sin and of death. For what the
law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending
His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as offering for sin,
condemned sin in the flesh; that the ordinance of the law might be
fulfilled in us, who walk not after flesh but after the Spirit. For they
that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that
are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit. For the mind of the flesh
is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace; because the mind
of the flesh is enmity against God \[19: 8: 1–7\].

The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children
of God;[\*](cc12.htm#an_119-4.md) and if children then heirs; heirs of God,
and joint heirs of Christ \[19:8:16–17\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_119-1">\*</span> The writer contrasts the self with the
Cosmic Conscious life. His consciousness of eternal life is made plain.

<span id="an_119-2">\*</span> No expression could be more clear cut,
more perfect. The man who enters Cosmic Consciousness is really a new
creature, and all his surroundings "become new"—take on a new face and
meaning. You get around to the other side of things, as it were; they
are the same, but also entirely different. "Things are not dismissed
from the places they held before. The earth is just as positive and
direct as it was before. But the soul is also real; it too is positive
and direct; no reasoning, no proof, has established it, undeniable
growth has established it" \[193: 180\].

<span id="an_119-3">\*</span> In Cosmic Consciousness there is
absolutely no sense of sin nor of death, the person feels that this last
is merely an incident in continuous life. The merely self conscious man
cannot, by the keeping of the "law" or in any other way, destroy either
sin or the sense of sin, but, "Christ"—i.e., the Cosmic Sense, can and
does accomplish both.

<span id="an_119-4">\*</span> All men who have Cosmic Consciousness are
on the same spiritual level in the same sense that all who are self
conscious are *men*—belong to the same species.

For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to
be compared with the glory[\*](cc12.htm#an_120-1.md) which shall be
revealed to usward. For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth
for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to
vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in
hope that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. For
we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together
until now. And not only so, but ourselves also, which have the first
fruits of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting
for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body \[19:8:18–24\].

And we know that to them that love God all things work together for good
\[19: 8: 28\].[\*](cc12.htm#an_120-2.md) For I am persuaded that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor
things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God
\[19:8:38–39\]. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing
is unclean of itself; save that to him who accounteth anything to be
unclean, to him it is unclean \[19: 14: 14\].

<span id="an_120-1">\*</span> Paul speaks of the glory and joy of the
Cosmic Conscious life just dawning upon the world compared with the self
conscious state theretofore universal. "Vistas of glory," says Whitman,
"incessant and branching." "Joy, always joy," says Elukhanam. "Joy
beginning but without ending," says E. C. "When you have once," says
Seraphita \[that is, Balzac\] ''felt the delights of the divine
intoxication ( illumination) then all is yours" \[7: 182\]. Compare also
the following extracts from Behmen, in which he in like manner with Paul
contrasts the Self with the Cosmic Conscious life: "The external world
or the external life is not a valley of suffering for those who enjoy
it, but only for those who know of a higher life. The animal enjoys
animal life; the intellect the intellectual realm; but he who has
entered into regeneration recognises his terrestrial existence as a
burden and prison. With this recognition he takes upon himself the cross
of Christ" \[97: 325\].

"The holy and heavenly man, hidden in the monstrous (external) man, is
as much in heaven as God, and heaven is in him, and the heart or light
of God is begotten and born in him. Thus is God in him and he in God.
God is nearer to him than his bestial body" \[97: 326\].

<span id="an_120-2">\*</span> An expression of the optimism which
belongs to Cosmic Consciousness. Compare Whitman; "Omnes! Omnes! Let
others ignore what they may, I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate
that part also, I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is,
and I say there is in fact no evil" \[193: 22\].

To sum up: We have in this case:

*a*. The characteristic suddenness that belongs to the oncoming of the
New Sense. The new birth takes place at a given place and moment.

*b*. We have the subjective light clearly, very strongly, manifested.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

*c*. We have intellectual illumination of the most pronounced character.

*d*. We have very strongly marked moral exaltation.

*e*. We have the conviction, the sense of immortality, the extinction of
the sense of sin and the extinction of the fear of death.
