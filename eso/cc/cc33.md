### CHAPTER 10.

*Colonel James Gardiner*.

1688–1745.

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> January 10, 1688. Is said to have
fought three duels before he was grown up. Entered the army young and
fought with great bravery. His relations with women said to have been
free, even licentious. Was not religious, even the reverse of that, but
at times suffered "inexpressible remorse," on account of his life, which
seemed to him evil. In the middle of July, 1719, when he was thirty-one
and a half years of age, occurred the event which gives him a place in
this volume: "He had spent the evening in some gay company and had an
unhappy assignation with a married woman, whom he was to attend exactly
at twelve. The company broke up at eleven, and, not judging it
convenient to anticipate

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

the time appointed, he went into his chamber to kill the tedious hour,
perhaps with some amusing book, or some other way. But it very
accidentally happened that he took up a religious book, which his good
mother or aunt had, without his knowledge, slipped into his portmanteau.
It was called, if I remember the title exactly, 'The Christian Soldier,
or Heaven Taken by Storm,' and it was written by Mr. Thomas Watson.
Guessing by the title of it that he would find some phrases of his own
profession spiritualized in a manner which he thought might afford him
some diversion, he resolved to dip into it; but he took no serious
notice of anything it had in it. <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) And
yet while this book was in his hand an impression was made upon his mind
(perhaps God only knows how) which drew after it a train of the most
important and happy consequences. He thought he saw an unusual blaze of
light fall upon the book which he was reading, which he at first
imagined might happen by some accident in the candle; but lifting up his
eyes, he apprehended, to his extreme amazement, that there was before
him, as it were suspended in the air, a visible representation of the
Lord Jesus Christ upon the cross, surrounded upon all sides with a
glory, and was impressed as if a voice, or something equivalent to a
voice, <span id="fr_10"></span>[†](#fn_10.md) had come to him to this
effect (for he was not confident as to the words): <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">'Oh,
sinner, did I suffer this for thee, and are these thy returns?'</span>
Struck with so amazing a phenomenon as this, there remained hardly any
life in him, <span id="fr_11"></span>[‡](#fn_11.md) so that he sank down in
the armchair in which he sat and continued, he knew not how long,
insensible" \[107:286\]. The immediate effect of Gardiner's experience
is said to have been a *knowledge*, or rather a *sight*, of the "majesty
and goodness of God," and his after life (a period of twenty-six years)
was of distinguished excellence. The "new man" was as virtuous and pure
and godly as the "old" had been licentious and profane \[107: 71\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[283:\*](cc33.htm#fr_9.md) He was wide
awake—probably extra wide awake—and at the same time his mind (for the
moment) was a blank. This is the condition which we are told by all the
authorities from Gautama to the present is sine qua non for the oncoming
of illumination.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[283:†](cc33.htm#fr_10.md) As to the objectivity or
subjectivity of the "voice" in such cases see remarks under head of
"Moses"—what the person sees comes, of course, under the same category.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[283:‡](cc33.htm#fr_11.md) "Less than a drachm of
blood remains in me that does not tremble," says Dante, under similar
circumstances \[71: 192\].
