### CHAPTER 5.

*Mohammed*.

<span class="smallcaps">Born</span> 570; died 632.

This case, both in detail and ensemble, is marvellously complete. The
contempt entertained towards this man by Christians is as creditable to
them as is the corresponding contempt entertained towards Jesus by
Mussulmans creditable to these. Mohammed was born in the tribe of
Koreish, in August, in the year 570. His inheritance was five camels and
a slave girl. His father died before his birth and his mother when he
was six years old. As a boy and youth he earned his living tending sheep
and goats.

Later he was a camel driver. At the age of twenty-five he married
Cadijah, who was forty. The union was an eminently happy one. He was an
honest, upright man, irreproachable in his domestic relations and
universally esteemed by his fellow-citizens, who bestowed upon him the
sobriquet of El Amin—"the trusty." "Mohammed was a man of middle height
but a commanding presence; rather thin, but with broad shoulders and a
wide chest; a massive head, a frank, oval face, with a clear complexion,
restless black eyes, long, heavy eyelashes, a prominent, aquiline nose,
white teeth and a full, thick beard. . . . He was a man of highly
nervous organization, thoughtful, restless, inclined to melancholy and
possessing an extreme sensibility, being unable to endure the slightest
unpleasant odor or the least physical pain. . . . He was simple in his
habits, kind and courteous in his demeanor and agreeable in
conversation" \[152: 19–20\].

It seems that Mohammed had been, as a young and middle-aged

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

man, before his experience on Mount Hara, serious, devout, earnest and
deeply religious. It also seems (as already stated) that this mental
constitution is an essential prerequisite to the attainment of Cosmic
Consciousness. He clearly saw that the religion of his countrymen was
far from being in a satisfactory condition, and it appeared to him that
the time for reform or a new departure had arrived.

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

We are told that he gradually absented himself from society and sought
the solitude of a cavern on Mount Hara (about three leagues north of
Mecca), where, in emulation of the Christian anchorites of the desert,
he would remain days and nights together engaged in prayer and
meditation. . .. He became subject to visions, ecstasies and trances. .
.. At length, it is said, what had hitherto been shadowed out in dreams
was made apparent and distinct by an angelic apparition and a divine
annunciation.

It was in the fortieth year of his age when this famous revelation took
place. Accounts are given of it by Moslem writers, as if received from
his own lips, and it is alluded to in certain passages of the Koran. He
was passing, as was his wont, the month of Ramadan in the cavern of
Mount Hara, endeavoring by fasting, prayer and solitary meditation to
elevate his thoughts to the contemplation of divine truth.

It was on the night called by Arabs Al Kader, or The Divine Decree; a
night in which, according to the Koran, angels descend to earth and
Gabriel brings down the decrees of God. During that night there is peace
on earth, and a holy quiet reigns over all nature until the rising of
the morn.

As Mohammed, in the silent watches of the night, lay wrapped in his
mantle, he heard a voice calling upon him. Uncovering his head, a flood
of light broke upon him of such intolerable splendor that he swooned. On
regaining his senses he beheld an angel in a human form, which,
approaching from a distance, displayed a silken cloth covered with
written characters. <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">"Read!"</span>
said the angel. "I know not how to read!" replied Mohammed. <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">"Read!"</span>
repeated the angel, <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">"in
the name of the Lord, who has created all things; who created man from a
clot of blood. Read, in the name of the Most High, who taught man the
use of the pen; who sheds on his soul the ray of knowledge and teaches
him what before he knew not."</span>

Upon this Mohammed instantly felt his understanding illumined with
celestial light and read what was written on the cloth, which contained
the decree of God, as afterwards promulgated in the Koran. 'When he had
finished the perusal the heavenly messenger announced: <span
style="font-family: Lucida Blackletter, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">"Oh,
Mohammed, of a verity thou art the prophet of God! And I am his angel
Gabriel!"</span>

Mohammed, we are told, came trembling and agitated to Cadijah in the
morning, not knowing whether what he had heard and seen was indeed true,
and that he was a prophet decreed to effect that reform so long the
object of

</div>

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

his meditations; or whether it might not be a mere vision, a delusion of
the senses, or worse than all, the apparition of an evil spirit \[102:
32–3\].

</div>

Illumination in Mohammed's case took place in or about the month of
April. It occurred in the Arabic month Ramadan (82a:553). Now in the
first year after the Hegira this month fell in our December. But the
Mohammedan year is ten days shorter than the time actually taken by the
revolution of the earth in its orbit. It is plain, therefore, that any
given Mohammedan date would recur ten days earlier year by year. Now the
Hegira was twelve years after Mohammed's illumination. That is to say,
if the month Ramadan corresponded with December just after the Hegira it
would have corresponded with April at the time of the prophet's
illumination. That illumination, therefore, would have taken place in
April.

If Mohammed was a case of Cosmic Consciousness this fact ought to appear
clearly in the writings which he left to the world. Does it? As a matter
of fact these are not easily understood in an English translation and
from the modern, western, point of view. Note, for instance, the remarks
of one reader who might be supposed competent to appreciate such a work
as the Qur’an. Carlyle says of it \[59: 295\]: "It is as toilsome
reading as ever I undertook. A wearisome, confused jumble, crude,
incondite, endless iterations, longwindedness, entanglement,
insupportable stupidity in short," and so on at some length.

In spite of all this, however, even if multiplied a thousand times, the
greatness, power, spirituality of the book must be considered
established by the results it has produced in the world. No effect can
be greater than its cause, and the effect in this case (the spiritual
elevation of many millions of men for many generations) must be admitted
to have been enormous. Moreover, it seems to the writer that, in spite
of the undoubted difficulty above referred to, almost any candid reader
may perceive for himself, upon its perusal, that the book has great
qualities, even though he may not be able to fully grasp them.

But there is another reason why we do not find just what we want for our
present purpose in the Qur’an. It is written entirely

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

from the point of view of the Cosmic Sense; as its author would say, it
is all dictated by Gabriel. There are no passages in which the self
conscious tells us about the cosmic conscious Mohammed—such passages as
occur with great frequency in the writings of Yepes, Whitman and
others—passages written from the point of view of the "Shakespeare"
Sonnets. Nevertheless, there are here and there sentences in the Qur’an
that almost certainly refer to the experience in question, as, for
instance, the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the
earth,[\*](cc14.htm#an_128-1.md) and the alternation of night and day, and
in the ship that runneth in the sea with that which profits man, and in
what water God sends down from heaven and quickens therewith the earth
after its death, and spreads abroad therein all kinds of cattle, and in
the shifting of the winds, and in the clouds that are pressed into
service betwixt heaven and earth, are signs to people who can understand
\[151:22\].

And when we said to thee, "Verily, thy Lord encompasses
men!"[\*](cc14.htm#an_128-2.md) and we made the vision which we showed thee
only a cause of sedition unto men, and the cursed tree as well; for we
will frighten them, but it will only increase them in great rebellion
\[153:7\].

They will ask thee of the spirit.[\*](cc14.htm#an_128-3.md) Say, "The
spirit comes at the bidding of my Lord, and ye are given but a little
knowledge thereof." If we had wished we would have taken away that with
which we have inspired thee: then thou wouldst have found no guardian
against us, unless by a mercy from thy Lord; verily, his grace towards
thee is great \[153: 10\]!

We do not descend[\*](cc14.htm#an_128-4.md) save at the bidding of thy
Lord: His is what is before us, and what is behind us, and what is
between those; for thy Lord is never forgetful—the Lord of the heavens
and the earth, and of what is between the two; then serve Him and
persevere in His service \[153:31–2\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_128-1">\*</span> Mohammed is seeking to point out the (to
him) certainty of an infinitely good God and eternal life. He uses here
very much the same language as does Whitman in the same connection: "I
hear you whispering there O stars of heaven, O suns, O grass of graves,
O perpetual transfers and promotions, if you do not say anything how can
I say anything" \[193: 77\]?

<span id="an_128-2">\*</span> "The vision"—evidently the cosmic vision.

<span id="an_128-3">\*</span> He speaks of "the spirit" who visits
him—"Gabriel," the Cosmic Sense—and uses almost the same words as Jesus:
"The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof,
but knowest not whence it cometh and whither it goeth: *so is every one
that is born of the Spirit*" \[17: 3: 8\].

<span id="an_128-4">\*</span> "We do not descend." Palmer's note to
these words is: "Among various conjectures the one most usually accepted
by the Mohammedan commentators is, that these are the words of the angel
Gabriel in answer to Mohammed's complaint of long intervals elapsing
between the periods of revelation. Compare, in chapter on Bacon, infra
Sonnet xxxiii, and comment thereon.

</div>

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Verily, the hour is coming, I almost make it
appear,[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-1.md) that every soul may be recompensed for
its efforts \[153:35\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_129-1">\*</span> The words, "I almost make it appear,"
would seem to refer to the feeling almost or quite universal with those
having cosmic consciousness that universal endowment with this faculty
is near, is imminent, and that an individual having the faculty can
bestow it almost at will. "I bestow," says Whitman, "upon any man or
woman the entrance to all the gifts of the universe." There is a sense,
of course, in which both these propositions are true: (1) The new
faculty is becoming universal and (2) these men, having the faculty, do
bestow it upon such others as coming into contact with them are
eligible.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

This life of the world is nothing but a sport and a play; but, verily,
the abode of the next world—that is, life. If they did but know! \[153:
124.\][\*](cc14.htm#an_129-2.md)

He who wishes for the tilth of the next world,[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-3.md) we
will increase for him the tilth; and he who desires the tilth of this
world, we will give him thereof; but in the next he shall have no
portion \[153:207\].

The life of this world is but a play and a sport;[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-4.md)
but if you believe and fear God, he will give you your hire \[153:
232\].

And every soul shall come—with it a driver and a witness! Thou wert
heedless of this, and we withdrew thy veil[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-5.md) from
thee, and to-day is thine eyesight keen! \[153: 243.\]

And paradise shall be brought[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-6.md) near to the
pious—not far off \[153:243\].

This is what ye are promised,[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-7.md) to every one who
turns frequently (to God) and keeps His commandments, who fears the
merciful in secret and brings a repentant heart. Enter into it in peace;
this is the day of eternity! \[153: 244.\]

And listen for the day[\*](cc14.htm#an_129-8.md) when the crier shall cry
from a near place—the day when they shall hear the shout in truth—that
is, the day of coming forth \[153: 244\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_129-2">\*</span>The distinction between the self and cosmic
conscious lives.

<span id="an_129-3">\*</span>A rich man, from the mere fact of being
such, is unlikely to enter cosmic consciousness. If he does he probably
abandons his wealth, as did Gautama and E. C. If, however, a man (not
having it) very earnestly desires wealth, or (having it) sets his heart
upon it, such shall certainly in Cosmic Consciousness "have no portion."

<span id="an_129-4">\*</span>Insignificance of the self conscious as
compared with the cosmic conscious life.

<span id="an_129-5">\*</span>"Withdrew thy veil"—reference to the
illumination of Mohammed. He "saw the heavens rent asunder" \[15: 1:
101.

<span id="an_129-6">\*</span>"The kingdom of God is nigh at hand" \[16:
21: 31\]. "The kingdom of God is within you" \[16: 17: 21\].

<span id="an_129-7">\*</span>Illumination—the Cosmic Sense—the Brahmic
bliss—the kingdom of God—is rightly called here "the day of eternity,"
since the entrance to it is the entrance to immortality—eternity.

<span id="an_129-8">\*</span>The suddenness and unexpectedness of the
oncoming of Cosmic Consciousness is noted in the writings of nearly all
of those who have experienced illumination. "That day —the day of
deliverance—shall come to you in what place you know not; it shall come,
but you know not the time. In the pulpit while you are preaching the
sermon, behold! suddenly the ties and the bands shall drop off; in the
prison One shall come, and you shall go free forever. In the field, with
the plough and chain-harrow; by the side of your horse in the stall; in
the midst of fashionable

</div>

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

life; in making and receiving morning calls; in your drawing-room——even
there, who knows? It shall duly, at the appointed hour, come \[61:
231\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

Know that the life of this world is but a sport,[\*](cc14.htm#an_130-1.md)
and a play, and an adornment, and something to boast of amongst
yourselves; and the multiplying of children is like a rain-growth, its
vegetation pleases the misbelievers; then they wither away, and thou
mayest see them become yellow; then they become but grit \[153:268\].

Verily, we set it[\*](cc14.htm#an_130-2.md) down on the Night of Power! And
what shall make thee know what the Night of Power is? The Night of Power
is better than a thousand months! The angels and the spirits descend
therein, by the permission of their Lord with every bidding \[153:
337\].

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 64px;font-size:80%;color: purple;">

<span id="an_130-1">\*</span>Insignificance of the merely self conscious
life.

<span id="an_130-2">\*</span>"It," the Qur’an, "the Night of Power" (the
night of Mohammed's illumination), "is better than a thousand months!"
So Böhme, referring to his illumination, says \[40:15\]: "The gate was
opened to me that in *one-quarter of an hour* I saw and knew more than
if I had been many years together at an university."

</div>

In this case we have authentically reported (as it seems) all the
fundamental elements required to constitute a case of Cosmic
Consciousness:

*a*. The subjective light.

*b*. The moral elevation.

*c*. The intellectual illumination.

*d*. The sense of immortality.

*e*. The definiteness, suddenness and unexpectedness of the oncoming of
the new state.

*f*. The previous mental and physical character of the man.

*g*. The age of illumination, in his fortieth year, later than the
average, but while he was still in his prime.

*h*. The added charm to his personality, so that he was able to gain and
hold devoted followers.
