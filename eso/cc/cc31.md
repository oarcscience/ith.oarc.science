### CHAPTER 8.

*Blaise Pascal*.

1623–1772.

<span class="smallcaps">He</span> was born on the 19th of June, 1623. As
a child, boy and young man, he was exceptionally precocious—in this
respect comparable to Bacon. It is said that, although his parents
endeavored to restrain his mental development, yet "at the age of ten he
had propounded an acoustic theory in advance of the views then
entertained; at twelve he had evolved geometry from his own reflections;
and at fifteen he composed a treatise on conic sections which Descartes
refused to believe in as having proceeded from so young a mind" \[88:
329\].

Pascal's health was all his life delicate. He was probably always a
perfectly moral man, though fond of gaiety and the social pleasures of
his time and country.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

He gave abundant evidence throughout his whole life that he possessed in
an unusual degree the mental honesty and earnestness that seems always
to belong to those who attain to the Cosmic Sense.

In November, 1654, he being then thirty-one and a half years old,
something happened which radically altered Pascal's life. From that date
he practically abandoned the world and became and remained, until his
death, markedly religious and charitable. From that date, however, his
life was very secluded and few details appear to be known.

Bright as his intellect was before November, 1654, it was still brighter
afterwards. About a year subsequent to that date he began the
"Provincial Letters," and later wrote his "Pensées," both of which works
(though the latter is only a series of notes for a book to be written)
show extraordinary mental qualities. It is safe to say that he could not
have written either of them before the above date.

A few days after Pascal's death a servant felt by chance something hard
and thick under the cloth of his doublet. Ripping the seam in the
neighborhood he found a folded parchment, and within this a folded
paper. These both bore writing in Pascal's hand, the words of which are
those here given. Both parchment and paper were taken to Pascal's
sister, Madame Périer, who showed them to some friend. They all saw at
once that these words thus written by Pascal in duplicate and preserved
by him with so much care and trouble ( removing them himself, as he did,
from garment to garment), must have had in his eyes a profound meaning.
Some time after the death of Madame Périer (which happened twenty-five
years after the death of her brother), her children communicated the
documents to a friar, who was an intimate friend of the family. He
copied the document and wrote some pages of commentary upon it, to which
Marguerite Périer added some further pages. These commentaries are now
lost, as is also the parchment. The paper copy, however, in Pascal's
hand, is still extant in the Bibliotheque Nationale. Paris. It was
Cordocet

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

who gave the document the name of "Pascal's Mystic Amulette" \[112a:
156\].

Translated into English the words of the amulet are as follows: "The
year of grace 1654, Monday, 23 November, day of St. Clement, Pope and
Martyr. From about half-past ten in the evening until about half-past
twelve, midnight, FIRE. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not
of the philosophers nor of the Wise. Assurance, joy, assurance, feeling,
joy, peace. <span class="smallcaps">God of Jesus Christ</span>, my God
and thy God. Thy God shall be my God. Forgotten of the world and of all
except <span class="smallcaps">God</span>. He is only found in the ways
taught in the Gospel. <span class="smallcaps">The sublimity of the human
soul</span>. Just Father, the world has not known thee but I have known
thee. Joy, joy, joy, tears of joy. I do not separate myself from thee.
They left me behind, me a fountain of living water. My God, do not leave
me. Let me not be separated from thee eternally. This is eternal life
that they should know thee the only true God and him whom thou hast
sent. <span class="smallcaps">Jesus Christ—Jesus Christ</span>. I have
separated myself from him; I have fled, renounced, crucified him. Let me
not be forever separated from him. One is saved only by the teaching of
the Gospel. <span class="smallcaps">Reconciliation total and
sweet</span>. Total submission to <span class="smallcaps">Jesus
Christ</span> and to my <span class="smallcaps">director</span>.
Continual joy for the days of my life on earth. I shall not forget what
you have taught me. Amen." <span id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md)

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

No one who has read this book so far will have, I think, the least doubt
as to the meaning of the words of the amulet.

The subjective light was evidently strongly marked. Immediately
following it comes the sense of liberation, salvation, joy, content,
intense thankfulness. Then the realization of the grandeur of the human
soul, immediately followed by the rapture of the realization of God. He
glances back and sees how futile his life and ambitions have so far
been. Then realizes his present reconcilement with the cosmos and that
the rest of his life must be continual joy.

The words of the amulet, the care and secrecy with which it was
preserved, its date in reference to Pascal's age, Pascal's splendid
intellect and previous character so far as known to us, the change in
his life, synchronous with the date of the amulet,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

his moral exaltation and intellectual illumination from and after that
time; above all, the subjective light, which seems to have been more
than usually pronounced and longer than usually continued, though in the
case of John Yepes it is said to have lasted a whole night \[112:108\].
All these taken together make it certain to the mind of the writer that
Pascal was a case of Cosmic Consciousness. Of course, it has been said
of him, as it was of Jesus, Paul, Blake, and others, that Pascal was
insane; but I see no evidence of anything of the kind. The words of the
amulet bear testimony to having been written immediately after
illumination (before he went to bed that night, it would seem). They
are, therefore, naturally somewhat incoherent. They bear witness to joy,
triumph, enlightenment, not to disease. The man who writes them has just
seen the Brahmic Splendor and felt the Brahmic Bliss. That is all.
