One of the primary articles of faith of the New Age movement is that the
human body has energy fields surrounding it, and that those fields can
be used to diagnose the internal state of the body (and mind). This idea
can be traced to fringe science of the 18th, 19th and early 20th
century, including, the 'Animal Magnetism' of Mesmer, the 'Odic force'
of Baron Carl von Reichenbach, and Edwin D. Babbit, and the work of Dr.
Walter J. Kilner, the author of this book. Kilner was the first to use
the term 'human aura' in a medical context. The idea of halos goes back
a long way. Besides the conventional glowing ring around the head of
western depictions of saint, Buddha was said to have glowed with light
shortly before his death. Buddhist iconography depicts circular pools of
light surrounding celestial beings.

However, Kilner, using specially developed filters, believed that he
could view a luminous field surrounding any human being, not just the
saintly. In this text, proofed from the second edition of 1920, he
describes dozens of case studies where he used the color and shape of
the aura to perform medical diagnosis. The problem is that very few
could reproduce Kilner's results, and the medical community was
understandably skeptical. This may have been because of the N-Ray
scandal of 1903, only a few years before Kilner announced his results in
1911. Just a few years before, a Professor Blondlot of Nancy University,
France, had announced that he had discovered a new kind of radiation,
N-rays, or Nancy-rays. These were supposedly produced by both inorganic
substances but also human nervous activity. Shortly after this, an
American physicist, Robert W. Wood, had debunked N-Rays by
surreptitiously removing a key prism from Blondlot's N-ray detector,
which apparently had no effect on the results.

Today the human aura is still considered speculative, in spite of the
striking images produced by techniques such as Kirilian photography. The
human body does have fluctuations in electrical conductivity which can
be correlated with changes in mental state, a phenomena which is
utilized by lie detectors, biofeedback devices, and the 'E-Meter.'
Acupuncture is based on a map of internal channels of energy in the
body, unknown to western science. So it is not so far fetched that there
might be some kind of unknown energy field which encompasses the human
body, and if so, it might be used for medical purposes.
