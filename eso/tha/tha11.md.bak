### CHAPTER X

#### THE AURA DURING PREGNANCY

IT is not uncommon for a patient, after she has missed one or two
periods, to ask a medical man "am I pregnant?" Delay in answering is not
always acceptable. The difficulties in arriving at a correct conclusion
in very early pregnancy are great, so that any fresh method that can aid
diagnosis will no doubt be appreciated. It must be understood that no
single sign of pregnancy, as described below can be accepted by itself,
but that when more than one sign points in the same direction, either
one way or the other, an almost certain opinion may be expressed. There
are three distinct signs made manifest by changes in the aura; two are
arrived at through the investigations by c.c. bands, and the third is a
slight alteration in the shape of the auras and in their texture.

When inspecting an aura to determine whether an early stage of pregnancy
exists, the first step in the examination is to ascertain if the shape
of both auras be normal by the sides and back, and note their widths,
especially the inner aura over the various parts of the body. This
supplies a standard by which the measurements over the front of the body
can be compared. As a rule a woman in good health and not enceinte, will
show the two auras of the same width all down the front of the trunk,
with the occasional exception that they may be a little wider in front
of the breasts when a menstrual period is at hand. In almost every case
of early pregnancy the outer aura is slightly but definitely wider at
the lower part of the abdomen, the alteration commencing a short
distance

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

below the umbilicus; in the later stages this enlargement extends higher
up. At the same time there is always an increase in front of the mammæ,
which is best observed when the patient does not stand completely
sideways, but only sufficiently to permit the breasts to be silhouetted
one at a time against the background. When the position of the woman is
such that the best view of the aura before the breast is obtained, a
small ray proceeding from the nipple is often seen. In addition to the
extra breadth, the aura frequently appears denser in texture.

The inner aura also participates in the alteration at the same places as
does the outer. Its breadth is a little increased in the early stages of
pregnancy, but not to the same extent as at a later period, and its
opacity is a trifle greater, and what is extremely important, striation
remains unchanged. Each case must be fully investigated and judged on
its own merits, as owing to individual differences no fixed standards
for auras can be laid down.

It has been constantly noticed during the inspection of a pregnant
woman, that the aura is not so distinct as is usually the case in
health. For some time this was attributed to various causes, such as bad
light, etc., until it had been observed so frequently that there could
be no doubt about its connection with the patient's condition. Looking
over the different records, this decrease of brilliancy occurs in a
considerable percentage of cases, so that it may be accepted as an
auxiliary sign of pregnancy, and it.; presence may assist in forming an
opinion in a doubtful instance

After the preliminary inspection the observer next proceeds to tests
with the c.c. bands. For this part of the examination the woman should
first stand facing the investigator. The vertical c.c. band will then be
perceived uniform throughout its length if she be in good health and
enceinte. Special attention

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

must be paid to the portion of the band upon the lower part of the band
near the pubes. This is of importance in ascertaining that the woman
shows no sign of impending menstruation. When the c.c. band is used
transversely over the breasts, the colour in women, who are neither
enceinte nor nursing an infant, nor suffering from any affection of the
mammæ, is naturally even (except over the areolæ and nipples), not only
on the breasts themselves but also on the adjacent parts of the body.
During pregnancy and lactation, the colour not uncommonly becomes paler
over the mammæ. The lighter tint is due to a modification of the aura
similar to that already considered in chapter viii. This alteration has
no significance in itself, but affords valuable corroboration that a
change has taken place in the breasts. When a transverse c.c. band is
projected upon the epigastric and hypogastric regions, an alteration of
colour is rare, even though the patient may be suffering from nausea and
vomiting, pointing to the fact that the gastric disturbance is not so
dependent upon local derangement as upon some more general influence.

[Case 70](tha10.htm#case70.md) is an instance somewhat analogous to stomach
troubles during pregnancy. Should, however, a woman have been suffering
from some definite gastric trouble previous to gestation the above
statement will, of course, not hold good. No further assistance can be
obtained from the c.c. bands when employed upon the front of the body.

Allusion has been made to the fact that the majority of women in the
prime of life show a change in the aura over the lumbo-sacral region of
the back, when the c.c. band is darkened or even changed in hue. *This
patch nearly always vanishes* from the sacrum during pregnancy,
*generally during the early stages*. However, if the prospective mother
suffers from more than the average amount of pain during menstrual
periods, the patch will therefore be usually darker, and in consequence

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

will persist longer; but in any case it generally disappears before the
fourth month. But should this discoloured area be due to any other
cause, such as rheumatism, gestation will exert no influence upon it.
The presence of this patch rather militates against the probability of
pregnancy. Absence of this mark in a woman who is known to have
previously had it, or to have suffered from a considerable amount of
backache during her monthly periods, is a very important if not an
absolute sign of pregnancy, unless it was due to some other cause which
has been removed.

When the transverse c.c. band is employed upon the lowest part of the
abdomen, with the patient standing sideways, the colours of the
extensions are often dissimilar. If this happens, the one in front of
the abdomen is more likely to be lighter than that at the back. This is
due to some such alteration of the aura as has been discussed
previously, and is of positive value unless some change was detected in
the preceding examination of the abdomen, with the patient facing, is
the cause of the variance.

To sum up, the early signs of gestation as shown by the aura are:

1\. A slight increase in the size of the aura at the lower part of the
abdomen and in front of the breasts. The inner, too, may be a little
wider, but it always retains its striation perfect.

2\. The c.c. band shows no discolouration on the lower part of the
abdomen. A coloured patch over the stomach is unusual, unless there was
previous gastric trouble. The band is often lighter over the breasts.

3\. Absence of the dark area on the lumbo-sacral regions.

4\. A general indistinctness of the two auras may be added as an
auxiliary sign.

The following is the earliest case of pregnancy the writer has had the
opportunity of inspecting.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

<span id="case86">Case 86</span>. C., a married woman thirty-three years
of age, the mother of two children, having missed one period, was
desirous of knowing whether she was to expect another baby. She was not
a very strong woman, but at the time was in good health. There were good
reasons for knowing that she could not have been pregnant for a longer
time than thirty days at the most. She had been suffering from *pain
across her loins* especially when tired, and even at the time of
inspection was not quite free of it, but *usually had none during
menstruation*.

The outer aura was distinct and the inner below the average, but
striation could be easily distinguished. As she stood facing the
observer, the outer aura was ten inches round the head, twelve by the
trunk, and contracted to four by the ankles, being of a good ovoid
shape. In addition a perceptible ultra-outer aura was present. When she
turned sideways, the haze exhibited a slight bow-shaped bulge at the
small of the back, commencing at the head and ending at the feet. In
front of the trunk the general width was four inches, but before the
lower part of the abdomen increased to six, and over the breasts to
above five inches.

The inner aura was barely two and a half inches wide all over the body,
except in three places, viz., in front of the lower part of the abdomen,
at the small of the back where it was three inches, and in front of the
mammæ, where it was nearly as broad.

The vertical c.c. band was uniform in front of the body, but the
transverse showed paler areas over the mammæ. At the back there was a
large dark patch on the upper part of the sacrum which reached nearly as
high as the second lumbar vertebra.

In this instance all the changes from normal were those that might have
been expected in early pregnancy, with the exception of the dark patch
on the sacrum, which was accounted for by the rheumatic

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

pain, so an unqualified opinion was given that the patient was pregnant.
A child was born at the proper time.

Case 87. K., a lady twenty-nine years old, who had been married two
years and hoped that she was pregnant as she had missed one period and a
second was almost due. With the patient facing, the outer aura was ten
inches round the head and trunk, gradually diminishing to five by the
ankles. Sideways, at the back it was seen to be four inches at the level
of the shoulders and nates, with a slight bulge in the lumbar region,
and in front its normal width was four inches, but there was a small
increase in front of the breasts, and another at the lowest part of the
abdomen. In these places the inner aura looked opaque and in consequence
more distinct, but striation was clearly visible. Over the whole body
the inner aura was two inches in breadth, even, and displayed lineation.
The extension of the c.c. band in front of the abdomen was lighter than
at the same level at the back. When she again faced the investigator,
the vertical c.c. band appeared uniform all down the front, except over
the mammæ, where it was paler than the neighbouring portions of the
body. There was no alteration in tint over the gastric region. Over the
back the colour was not altered in any part. The lessons learnt from
this case are, first, that the woman did not show any signs of
approaching menstruation although it was just due; next, that the aura
disclosed the fact ti at there was physiological activity going on in
the breasts, and under that part of the abdomen near the pubes. There
was no doubt about the case being one of gestation.

The lady, whose aura was described in [case 49](tha08.htm#case49.md),
believed herself to be pregnant after missing two monthly periods. When
examined a third was nearly due. However, there was no alteration in the
haze in front of the right breast, nor any increase by the lower part of
the abdomen, neither was the c.c. band

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

deeper in shade above the pubes, while on the back a prominent dark
patch was visible on the sacrum.

In this case the only sign of pregnancy was the absence of
discolouration above the pubes when the abdomen was examined by means of
the c.c. bands, at a time when such ought to be usually present. The
diagnosis made was that gestation was out of the question, and that
menstruation would not supervene for four or five days at least, but the
date could not be foretold. As a matter of fact it commenced seven days
after inspection.

As pregnancy progresses the changes in the aura in front of the mammæ
increase, but vary in extent and do not altogether correspond with those
in front of the abdomen. The expansion is not confined to the outer
aura, as in most instances the inner becomes wider. Even when the inner
aura remains stationary in size, it becomes more opaque than the
neighbouring parts, showing that the glands are preparing to take on
their special functions. There is very rarely any difficulty in
determining whether the inner aura in the vicinity of the breasts has
enlarged, because comparison is so easily made with the adjoining parts
above and below. Although it may look to the naked eye finely granular,
yet the intervention of a dark carmine screen will disclose the striated
appearance of health. The auras of a woman who has reached the fifth
month of gestation will be broader than during the early stages, and may
continue to expand until the time for the birth of the child approaches.

The auras of women after the fourth or fifth month may be divided into
two classes, which although not very unlike yet show a difference which
is by no means artificial, and in the future may lead to important
results. In one group the broadest of the aura is not so wide as in the
second, while the shape is more regular, and follows with greater
exactitude the contour of the body, but usually attains its *maximum
size* 

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

*beneath the projecting abdomen*. When such an aura is viewed with the
patient standing sideways, through a deep carmine screen, it will be
found that the inner aura is also slightly enlarged all over the
abdomen.

In the second group the auras are wider and more distinct in *front of
the most prominent part of the abdomen*, giving rise to the "conical
aura," which often gives the impression that it is more extensive than
really is the case. When the two auras are separated in the ordinary
manner, the inner will also be found to be more or less conical, being a
little wider at the base in front of the most prominent part of the
abdomen, but hardly to the same extent as the outer. This is a good
instance of the inner aura growing larger and subsequently diminishing,
as it resumes its natural size after parturition.

With the c.c. bands the whole of the breasts, except the
[areolæ](errata.htm#19.md) and nipples, will usually appear lighter than
the neighbouring parts of the body, in whatever position the patient may
be placed.

This band when projected upon the thorax and abdomen may be even in
colour, but when the inner is conical it is often lighter on the front
of the abdomen. If a woman, who shows a conical aura, is examined with
the transverse c.c. band (antero-posteriorly), the extreme point of the
distended abdomen is generally paler, and the front extension is lighter
than the back extension. In the first group of cases the latter only
occurs.

The paleness of the colour over the breasts and abdomen when associated
with enlargement and definition of the inner aura, indicates the
probability that some alteration in the aura itself has taken place, and
is a good example of the statement that "a change in the texture of the
aura is a sufficient cause to produce an alteration in the tint of the
c.c. band." (Vide [chapter vi](tha05.htm#chap04)..md) The following is a
very interesting and instructive case.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

<span id="case88">Case 88</span>. Mrs. T. was pregnant for the fourth
time. Inspection took place soon after she had reached the sixth month
of gestation. The history was that she had been feeling exceedingly well
during the whole of the period until the last three weeks, when she was
suddenly roused from her sleep by a row in the house. From that moment
all movement of the child ceased, and the abdomen decreased in size,
although previous to the upset the movements of the infant had been
uncomfortably active. She was depressed thinking that the baby was dead.

The aura at the sides and back were normal in every respect. In front,
as she stood sideways to the investigator, the inner aura was about
three inches all down the thorax and lower extremities except that it
was a little more pronounced in front of the nipples. Before the
prominent abdomen it had increased in width. The outer aura was about
four inches down the whole of the front, except over the abdomen, where
it was conical and eight inches in breadth. The main interest was
centered in the inner aura. This above the sternal notch and down the
legs and thighs was finely striated in the usual manner. The part before
the lowest part of the abdomen was distinctly and coarsely granular,
while in front of the upper two thirds it was roughly striated and well
marked. Here it was in the transitional stage between the granular and
naturally striated states. Thus it could be seen that the aura was
normal all round the body, with the exception of the part in front of
the abdomen, where it was pathological. The c.c. band disclosed nothing
unusual, but it may be worth stating that it was lighter on the left
breast and darker on the right than the remaining portion of the band,
while at the same time the extensions were even. The explanation of this
effect happened to be quite easy, because the shade on the left breast
is that which was common during pregnancy, but the right breast was
distinctly

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

pigmented. Being healthy it did not affect the extension beyond the
body.

It was thought that in this case a diagnosis of a dead child would be
justified. Subsequent to the inspection of the aura, the uterus was
palpated, and was found to be softer than usual at the sixth month of
gestation No signs of any uterine souffle nor of fœtal heart-beats could
be distinguished. Two months later she was delivered of a dead child.

In conclusion the writer is conscious of many shortcomings which he
hopes his readers will overlook. The whole subject is fraught with vast
difficulties, not merely in practice but in description, as there are a
large number of minutiæ, very important, which is almost impossible to
put into words. He has tried to be as free from ambiguity as possible,
but at the same time feels that he has by no means done justice to the
subject. Time after time new phenomena have come to hand upsetting
previous ideas, and compelling him to begin afresh. He is positive that
some of the hypotheses which have been advanced to assist progress will
have to be rejected. He is firmly convinced that the study of the aura
physically will gradually come to the fore, as one of the aids to
diagnosis. Investigations upon the aura open up a large number of
questions for future observers.

To him the study of the aura has been a labour of love, but the main
object, *which is to help medical diagnosis*, has been perpetually kept
in view. He will be quite satisfied if true science has been advanced
even a little.

He cannot finish without thanking his many friends for their kind aid,
more especially those who have put themselves to great personal
inconvenience to forward his researches.
