### PREFACE

A book of this sort has so many debts to acknowledge that it should be
thickly set with notes and references, and yet in writing for the
general reader this is not possible. Therefore I can only say, speaking
generally, how much I owe to many and great thinkers from those of three
millenniums ago down to the present time. I am often asked to recommend
books on these subjects, but it is difficult to do so, for with regard
to many of the Indian thinkers on whom so much depends their invaluable
writings, even when translated, are hampered with Sanskrit terms very
difficult for those unused to them, and modern writers sometimes assume
more patience and perhaps knowledge than the average man with all the
preoccupations of life has time to possess. Yet he may wish to know.
This book is therefore an effort to interpret, to suggest, and no one
knows better than myself what a contracted statement it is of what a
great subject. Yet I venture to hope there are those to whom my
experiences and conclusions,

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

as I felt my way, may be of the same value that they have been to
myself. And this is why I have stated them in a detail which may be
misunderstood as egoism.
