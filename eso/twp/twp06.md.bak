### CHAPTER IV

It is necessary before going farther to make some allusion to the
strange world in which man passes nearly half his visible life--the
world of sleep. Nearly three centuries ago the delightful poet Herrick
wrote these lines:

Here are we all by day. By night we are hurled  
By dreams, each one, into a several world.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wonderful
insight!--Yet he would have been amazed indeed if anyone had told him
that his poet's instinct had revealed to him the existence of that
strange world behind the Looking Glass of which I have written so often
in these chapters. Yet it is so. The poets, the philosophers, those
whose wisdom and instinct alike draw them to what in India is called
*Realization* have always understood that through dreams is a very
direct way to the World As It Is--not as it appears in waking moments
when earth-bound Reason stands at the helm of the many-peopled ship
which a man calls "myself."

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Of course there are foolish little dreams also, mere bubbles on the
surface of memory of the day's doings, but these are easily known for
what they are and nobody marks them. Sometimes, however, and often to
those who least expect it, comes a dream marching with the certainty and
assurance of a god, or the profoundly disturbing enigmatic questioning
of the Sphinx, or the terrifying fore-vision of a prophecy, and all life
is changed and deflected for the dreamer. In other words, the dreamer
has for a moment stepped through the Looking Glass, or, in the Indian
phrase, he has realized with a sudden shock of truth that life is not as
he has thought it--but far otherwise. That man is fortunate, for to most
people such knowledge comes only in the act of what we call death. It
may then be guessed by the look of helpless surrender, of awful
recognition on the faces of the dying as their true Selves look into
their hearts. Very happy are those who have seen glimpses already
through the eyes of Death's younger brother, Sleep. And this is one of
the many reasons why some knowledge of the world of dreams is desirable.

So strongly were the Greeks impressed with the haunting mystery of this
state of consciousness

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

that they offered divine honors to the Triad of brothers, Hypnos,
Oneiros, Thanatos, or Sleep, Dream, and Death; and looking upon their
dark brooding faces yearned for the Knowledge to which each is in turn a
gateway.

One of my own first steps through the Looking Glass of early perception
into the true world behind it was in the revelation of a dream. I can
tell it only in part, and it is inherent in the mystic nature of dreams
that they can never carry the conviction to others that they do to
oneself. That is inevitable, springing as they do from roots deep-set in
long-past experiences of personality.

I was going on a very long journey, full of doubts and loneliness,
leaving much behind. It was hard to go. I think death must have that
same bitterness on the cup's edge from which all must drink excepting
those who know that death is nothing--a mere link and by no means the
most important in the chain of psychic evolution.

But one night far out at sea, a dream came walking the water. Dewy
twilight and an old garden at home, flowers tall in the borders, fading
into forgetfulness of color and light, the mouse-angels (as I was taught
to call the bats)

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

weaving magic circles about them under a dawning evening star. So far,
all familiar, but in the shadows a Personality not to be bound in any
earthly words I know, unseen but in the deepest sense of the word
absorbing my being into what was far beyond my understanding. I found
myself (it was long ago) pleading for the right to grief. How could it
be otherwise when the cup of bitterness is thrust into one's hand and
the Angel of the Darker Drink invites the soul forth to the lips to
taste it?

"It is so far--to the other end of the world," I said, and much more
that cannot be told. The answer was--but whether spoken or not I never
know: "You are ignorant indeed. All such grief is self-pity. And
furthermore in the real world there is no far or near--only states of
mind. Step out from it into the light. Even here, when you know a very
little, everything is just round the corner. If you try with all your
might you cannot lose touch when you know the truth. Everything is Here
and Now." And suddenly I *knew*, and the shock of delight which woke me
forever destroyed in me the fetters of "far and near" or any vestige of
belief in parting made by time, distance or death. There was

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

more than that, and how conveyed I cannot tell for I despair of
repeating the assurance which freed me from one of the most painful
maladies of ignorance.

India has always recognized three planes of consciousness connected with
sleep: Waking, Dreaming, and Deep Sleep. The first they class as the
Gross, the second as the Subtle, the third as the Pure. From deep sleep
are brought back the incommunicable dreams--often completely forgotten
by oneself--which bring us in touch with the Eternal Self. The subtle
states of consciousness with the one hand lull and numb the obstinate
perception of the senses and with the other free that huge submerged
subconscious self, in relation to which man's everyday consciousness has
been compared with the vastness of the submerged area of an iceberg in
comparison with that part which appears above the surface.

When this takes place many very singular things may and do happen. Men
may easily remember acts and scenes of experiences in former lives. Not
infrequently the strangest, most educative type of dream springs from
this source, and it should be regarded with deep interest for obvious
reasons. That has been a subject often

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

dealt with in fiction but never, so far as I know, in the fullness of
certitude with which it comes in reality. It is a state very difficult
of investigation because dreamers are naturally shy on such a subject,
but I may say it is almost a test of truth that when such experiences
are revealed they are natural and simple. They seldom are connected with
violently dramatic experiences or the arrogance which claims great place
or position in former lives for the dreamer, and they bring conviction
to those who experience them because they reveal the secrets of
development and arrest, and throw light on the way that still remains. I
have never heard of one in which the whole life was remembered except
when perfection of perception is attained, and such instances come
rarely to the world's knowledge.

There are happily few cases where homesickness for the beauty and verity
of the dream-life extinguishes all desire for the Mirror of the Passing
Show as revealed by the senses, and the dreamer pines through the long
inhospitable unrealities of the sunshine for night and the truths hidden
in darkness. This is a state as wholly undesirable as the paradises
revealed by drugs and drink. It is a psychic narcotic and should be
combated

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

manfully, especially as it is invariably associated with a diseased
condition of body which reveals it for what it is and marks a failure in
discipline. And there are the strange dreams which I call "fusing
dreams" where one personality meets another in sleep and a dual life is
lived, for a time becoming a reality and remembered in daytime but out
of reach except in sleep. This appears to be a foreshadowing of the
intimate communication and absorption in store (when psychological
matters are more clearly understood) for lovers or the highest forms of
friendship. Of this state I have no personal knowledge though I have
based a story ("V. Lydiat") on knowledge gained elsewhere, which
attracted interest from those who knew it was true in essentials.

I myself had at one time the very strange experience of a connected
story which I dreamed nightly. It was, so to speak, serialized, in that
it went on for many nights, beautiful, dramatic (as I thought) in
conception and development, springing and branching as a tree does from
its seed. But the singular thing was that a friend one day brought to my
house a visitor supposed to have unusual perception in such matters, and

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

when my dream-serial was mentioned he said, "Yes, I can see it," and
forthwith began to describe with perfect accuracy the terraced lawns and
clipped box hedges which were always the beginning when the mists of
sleep rolled aside and the stage was set. I think this was a case of
mind-reading, startling in the extreme, for I had never given a detail
to a living soul. I had the impression that he could have told me the
whole story as easily, and regretted afterwards that I had shut down the
subject. For I never knew the end though I believe it is still latent in
my own perception. The experience ended as suddenly as it began.

I find that many of the subjects of my stories come to me in sleep in
the form of dramas which I see clearly acted before me; sometimes also
in the form of stories told dramatically after the fashion of
story-tellers in the bazaars of Asia. But I have never succeeded in
catching more than a flashing glimpse of the story-teller, and I know he
is not always the same. I have a belief that to come face to face with
him in dream would open the measureless stores of wisdom and beauty lost
in the past. Is art a recovery as well as a prophecy?

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

The titles almost always come in the state between sleeping and waking
when reason and thought lie on the threshold of consciousness like dogs
on duty but still dormant. When they take charge the connection is
broken and I must remember as I can. Daily events blunt the impressions
very quickly except in some remarkable cases.

I had lately a dream of extraordinary beauty and perception which I
shall not forget. It began in Kensington Gardens and a meeting with a
little middle-aged woman there, leading up to the discovery of a strange
boarding-house in London for people who had died with unfulfilled lives
which apparently came to nothing, but who were now directing themselves
along ways of fulfilment, absolutely unconscious that they had undergone
the experience of death. I dreamed the name also: "The House of
Fulfilment." That title I have been compelled to steal for an "occult"
novel which nothing else would fit, but the story abides and I shall
write it one day. There were such strange people in it, and the
singularity was that, belonging to the World behind the Looking Glass,
they were obliged to work with tied hands in the conditions of this
until they

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

could make good. The house was in one of the little old-fashioned
Georgian streets of Kensington . . . running up the hill from noisy
Kensington High Street, very quiet, with yellowing poplars looking over
the wall and bushes of Michaelmas daisies in the borders. I see it all.

I hope I shall not be suspected of any arrogance in telling these
experiences. I think those things told quite simply and truly are
helpful in the deciphering of a difficult subject and I should be glad
to know if other writers also dream many of their stories. It is
interesting, because quite undoubtedly the gift of creative art in its
differing degrees is one of the roads to the Land behind the Looking
Glass. There are reasons for that too long to enter into here but
irrefutable, and it is a singular fact that while the saints appear to
enter in great flashes of cosmic consciousness, the artist seems to take
the winged way of dreams. But there can be no fixed rule in such
matters, nor would one expect it.

There is one amazingly interesting fact in true dreams. It is that the
dreamer goes free. He regains his birthright and is no longer the slave
of the miserable dimensions of length, breadth and height which control
all our waking doings. Nor

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

is he bound by time as with a tether. Observe that in dreams time is no
more. It may be to-day and tomorrow at the same moment. You may be a
child, yet with all the memories and experiences of old age. You may
drift composedly down the street never touching it with a footfall. You
may melt through walls and doors like Christ after the Resurrection. You
may talk fearless and unamazed with friends who cross the river of death
to meet you, and know they never died. You may easily meet two
personalities of people you know, fused into one, and find it quite
comprehensible and natural until you wake and it blurs as the darkness
of the prison-gates closes on you; you may be in two places at the same
moment. Things can be absolutely simultaneous which in ordinary life are
consecutive. One great thinker has suggested that death itself may be a
passage from the consecutive to the simultaneous. This is very likely.
He had had in dreams a glimpse into the World behind the Looking Glass.

Profoundly beautiful subconscious revelations sometimes take place in
dreams. Here is one which carries a meaning not negligible.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

I knew two men who had once been close friends. The one had done the
other a terrible injury and its consequences had completely estranged
them. People did not even speak of either in the other's presence. All
was ended. But one day the injured man suddenly said to me: "It's a
strange thing. I hate the man. Heaven knows I have reason to. But I
dream of him constantly--can't get away from him; and always in my
dreams the old friendship is there and to be together is good right
through. Those are the happiest dreams I have. And yet waking, I would
run the country sooner than meet the fellow. I could kick myself for
being such an ass in my sleep."

As you will see, the submerged self he met in dreams knew best. It knew
that love is in its nature real and eternal and hatred a darkness, a
nothingness, which dissolves in the light of truth. I would give much to
know the dreams of the other man. Would they complete the story? I have
often wondered that. The first was, at all events, compelled in the
dream-world to Reality. Such a case is well understood in Indian
teaching. India asserts that the infinite tide of perfection

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

behind all of us flows in by such inlets as the different planes of
consciousness in sleep.

"For in the animal lay hidden and possible the man, and when the door of
consciousness was opened, man rushed out. And in man lies hidden
perfection barred and locked away by ignorance. With Realization he
comes in touch with the Hidden Treasure."

Milton was right in his almost miraculously perceptive assertion that
high revelations are made "in clear dream and solemn vision."

For in sleep we move on much more subtle and permeative planes of action
than in waking, and the more we are daily disciplined in opening up the
channel of communication with the untrodden continent of our submerged
self--the lost Atlantis hidden in us all--the more wonderful and
illuminating are our dreams. This may be seen in the dreams recorded in
the Scriptures of the great Faiths. They would form a book of profound
psychological interest if analyzed and compared.

Yet, striking through apparently very commonplace personalities come
sometimes singularly revealing dreams, thus proving that in truth no one
is commonplace, that it is only the commonplace

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of ignorance in ourselves which so sees it. For below the dwarfed nature
of which our senses make report lies the submerged and marvelous self of
which the man himself is wholly unconscious except in the strange
visitings of dreams which he is unlikely to reveal to any human being
except in most unusual circumstances. Very often also, his everyday self
entirely fails to interpret them. He will say in bewilderment, "I knew
when I was asleep, but now it all seems nonsense." And I fancy most of
us have had the experience of dreams extraordinarily lovely and
revealing which the awaking sense clutched at for a moment and then let
go helplessly, drifting away shapelessly as mists at dawn. One may see
the dream-flowers wither in the hot clasp of our sense-perceptions, see
the dream-pageant fade and dissolve like sunset clouds, leaving nothing
behind but the gathering gray of loss.

That dream of being in two places at once--places that melt into each
other and are absolutely one--I have had often. Each is each, yet there
is no overlapping. I walk through the *one* and know no surprise.
Waking, I remember it perfectly but cannot intellectually understand how
it was possible, though I know well that is how

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

things are in the real world behind the Looking Glass, where the logic
and rules of the game are entirely different from those we know in front
of it. Because, as I learned in a dream already quoted, places there are
not solidarities but states of mind.

I have heard many people express the wish that they could control their
dreams and enjoy what they most desire in sleep. But that is a foolish
wish, for dreams would lose all significance if our everyday selves took
charge. It is precisely because they are off duty that the unexpected,
the illuminative, come through. This is the flaw in Du Maurier's
beautiful book, "Peter Ibbetson." The hero and heroine, divided in life,
meet nightly in dreams. The dream is a duet--but of the senses exalted
to the highest pitch. They dream together of exquisite jewels and
toilettes, of dinners at the choicest restaurants and wines of the
costliest vintages, operas, plays, by the most celebrated performers,
and so forth,--opiates for the sorrow of parting. Such dreams are
earth-bubbles. The senses are awake and guardant though the body sleeps.
They are a fairy story of the reasoning, clutching mind.

No. Let us rejoice that in the true dream the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

close guard of the senses is off duty and we go out free in the dark to
revelation. Very different is the wish that we could unfailingly meet
the hidden self and, joining hands, walk straight into the Real World,
and that wish can be gratified by patient discipline. And there the
disciplined body may receive its share, for it may be said with truth
that there is no sleep so deep, tranquilizing and profound as that which
is called "The Opener of the Gates."

The Greeks and Romans both believed in the healing power of dreams, and
in ancient Rome the College of the Inspired Dreams was a place of
gathering for those who were sick or sad. It was dedicated to Æsculapius
the Healer, and it was believed he was the inspirer of these dreams.
Those needing help slept in the quiet of the sacred cloisters and seldom
without result. One sees exactly why that should be and wishes such help
could be given now, and without human intervention, to those who need
it. But it is a true saying that we can participate in heaven and its
gifts only in so far as heaven is within ourselves. How can people empty
of heaven realize the possibilities of dreams or the meaning of that
little known saying of Christ's, "When the outside becomes

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the inside then the Kingdom of Heaven is come." It means that when for
any man the deceptions and distortions of the outer world are swallowed
up in realization of the inner, the hidden world,--when the outer and
the submerged selves have joined hands and are one,--then he has touched
on immortality and has drunk of the wine of eternal joy.

It is a strange thought that all round us, hidden in every recurring
night, lie these silent fields of harvest in which so few are reapers.
Yet they lie, ripening in sunshine. In the words of Professor James:

"One conclusion was forced upon my mind, and my impression of its truth
has ever since remained unshaken. It is that our normal waking
consciousness is but one special type of consciousness, whilst all about
it, parted from it by the filmiest of screens, there are potential forms
of consciousness entirely different. We may go through life without
suspecting their existence, but apply the requisite stimulus and at a
touch they are there in all their completeness."

With the last four words I disagree, for it is impossible for the
uninitiated to say what their completeness is when we know of cases
ranging

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

from the mere glimmer to the conflagration of revelation. But the
statement is true and striking and it is gladdening to see the
distinguished thinkers of the West gradually awaking to facts known and
taught for millenniums in the Orient. Professor James added:

"The whole drift of my experience goes to persuade me that the world of
our present consciousness is only one out of many worlds of
consciousness which exist, and that these other worlds must contain
experiences which have a meaning for our lives also."

That statement is clear and concise, but how far does it fall behind the
statement of St. Paul (with direct experience to back it) struggling
with the futilities of words to express what eye has not seen nor ear
heard, but nevertheless what he had known for truth in ways far beyond
mortal senses. (I condense.)

"I knew a man above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I cannot
tell; God knoweth!)--such a one caught up into the third heaven; How
that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it
is not possible for a man to utter."

In our version "possible" is translated "lawful,"

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

but the former is said to represent the meaning more closely. And again
he says, using the very illustration of the Looking Glass which I have
used so often, "For now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to
face."

Yes, there are indeed many states of consciousness and such a man could
have taught, can teach, modern investigators much about the varying
degrees of consciousness in dream and trance.

In India is the well-spring of knowledge of these states and their
powers and it is clearly stated by those who know that there are
dangers. In the World behind the Looking Glass are no guides. There a
man must depend upon the essential in himself and on nothing else. I
have written a story about that side of the world of dreams which came
to me so actually as a dream that though my hand wrote it I could never
say my objective self created it. It sums up more than I knew of the
subject at the time, but I have since learned its truth.

One of the characters says:

"We recognize a strange force, a very powerful dynamic. We consider it a
manifestation of the primal energy. It lies all round us for the taking
and in itself is neither had nor good. The

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

result depends on the person who uses it. The rules we call The Rules of
Detachment. Certainly this force may be used for a very high kind of
spiritual adventure, but in itself it is neutral. It is a sword. Now a
sword may be used by a god or a devil or any of the grades between." The
Rules of Detachment are given.

This force is of course related to the world of dreams, and the hero
persists in projecting himself into this state of consciousness without
knowledge of where safety lies. The story is concerned with his neglect
of the Rules of Safety and the terrible consequences and final
extrication. The point is that what you will meet in that world is what
you deserve to meet and what your own thoughts and life have invited.

"With a thought you may be in the horror of the Desolate Country, with
another in the Shining Land, for every man creates his own universe
until he can perceive it as it is in truth."

Indeed one must not walk unguarded among dreams. There are many people
whose degradation, slow but complete, has been consummated by what they
have met there. There are people in mad-houses who could testify to this
and more, and would not be believed if they did so. We do

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

not understand. We play with the Unknown and wreathe it with flowers and
one day it rises and petrifies us with a deadly stare. There are
thoughts and deeds which should make any man who is their slave fear to
sleep. Shakespeare knew this as he knew most other things. Look at his
Lady Macbeth crawling against the castle wall and shuddering at the very
thought of night and what it brings in hidden hands.

Sleep is so imminently near to the reality which brushes away illusion
and reveals our true selves. Does any man of that order need a more
burning hell than to meet himself and see the truth? It has been said
that the most appalling experience in ghost stories is that of the man
who meets the doppel gänger--his own double; and I recall a terrible
picture of Rossetti's--"How They Met Themselves"--where fear stares at
you from two ravaged faces. But what is the experience of meeting one's
outward semblance to that of meeting one's inward verisimilitude?

Many dreams visit us of which we miss the importance. The waking self
has not the knowledge to interpret them. The counsel is needed then of
one instructed who can "divine" as it says in the Bible. The Old and New
Testaments are

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

very wonderful dream-books, as they are also in all the psychological
matters in which the West begins to explore. It will be remembered in
Joseph's adventures in Egypt--that land of ancient mysteries--how the
two servants of Pharaoh and Pharaoh himself dreamed dreams which they
knew instinctively were important but could in no way decipher until
Joseph "divined" for them. If an adequate study were made of these and
the many allied cases of abnormal consciousness we should realize the
treasures of knowledge hidden for the seeker. Many thousands might be
helped to realization if their dreams could be divined for them, not
indeed after the methods of the modern psycho-analyst but by one who
understands something of the conditions of that world where the
subconscious meets us with face unveiled according to our capacity of
understanding.

Let it be understood that the enjoyment of life as presented to us in
the Mirror of the Passing Show is by no means hurt or hindered by
comprehension partial or complete of its illusions, and is neither
stilted nor highbrow, nor tinged with Puritanism. We can afford to love
what can no longer deceive or hurt us and every step

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

onward reveals more and more of the joy that is based on this
understanding.

Do we enjoy the theater less because we know the show is only a shadow
and reflection of life as it seems to us? Is it of less interest because
we know that presently the actors will have laid aside their assumed
characters with their dresses, and the lights will be extinguished and
the stage remain empty and echoing until the next troupe of actors
bounds on in the glitter of lights and watching intent faces? Eyes that
are unblinded perceive all the more clearly the beauty, irony, and
pathos of the show because they know that it must pass, that it dances
before them veiling from its actors and most of its spectators the
Utterly Lovely, the Wholly Desirable, which at times it attempts to
shadow forth.

In India they call this glittering, shifting, changing spectacle the
*Lila* or "Sport of God"--a conception that has meanings too profound to
be touched on here, though some minds will see the implication for
themselves. And of these implications one of the deepest is the meaning
of sleep and dreams, and the state of consciousness into which each one
of us is nightly thrown. It

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

is as though the evolving power within cried to the most crass and
materialistic of us all:

"You shall not wholly forget your true self and its origin. You bury it
in the day with schemes and fancies that heap the earth above it,
blinded, deafened and dead. But the night is mine and yours. Then, be
you what you will, sot, dollar-chaser, prostitute, thief, blinded with
frivolity or with earthly wisdom, drunken with the pleasures of the
Passing Show, I take you by the hand and lead you into the Ancient Dark,
forcing you to the sight of things lovely, terrible, grotesque, deadly,
foreshadowing, and thus compel you to remembrance of that which abides
when the fashion of this world passes away."

It is well to take the reminder of sleep and dreams. In that world those
who know carry the Lamp and Sword, and the universe is theirs.
