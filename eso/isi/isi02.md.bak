# THE ISIAC TABLET

###### OF

#### CARDINAL BEMBO.

THIS curious relic of an age long past cannot fail to attract the
attention of every earnest student of the Mysteries; its beauty of
design, its careful execution, its obvious antiquity, its certain
connection with that most incomprehensible scheme of religion—the
Egyptian, all combine to fascinate the mind and stimulate the intellect
in a search for the explanation of the purpose and meaning of this very
elaborate pictorial work of Art.

Mysterious in its conception, of unknown origin, and of peculiar
workmanship, this Tablet merits examination and research.

From the time of the learned Orientalist Kircher, and of the Classic
Pignorius, many eminent archæologists and men of letters have devoted
their energies to the elucidation of the hidden object of the designer,
who must have been as erudite in all the arts and wisdom of the
Egyptians, as he was skilful in execution. The well-known names of
Montfaucon, Shuckford, Warburton, Keysler, Caylus, the Abbé Banier, the
Abbé Pluché, Jablonski, Kenneth Mackenzie, Kenealy, Wilkinson, Eliphas
Lévi, and Bonwick, all of whom have ventured some opinions, are
sufficient proof of the worldwide interest that this Mensa Isiaca has
aroused. Many years have now passed away since the Author made a labour
of love of the drawing of the Tablet from which the Photogravure in this
volume was taken; and his drawing being finished, his work seemed
incomplete until he had supplied as its companion an explanatory
treatise, however scanty and imperfect it may be deemed. He begs the
indulgence of many a learned reader for its short-comings, and if he has
apparently undervalued the opinions of the modern school of scientific
Egyptology, it is only because of his conviction that the Tablet is
essentially of an Esoteric character, and therefore insusceptible of
ordinary methods of interpretation.

The Photogravure provided with this little volume, 10 ins. by 8ins., is
of course much smaller than the original, which is approximately 50 ins.
in length, and 30 ins. in breadth.

So far as can be ascertained, the Tablet has not been engraved nor
printed in its entirety since 1719, when it was published in France by
Montfaucon, and it has never been printed in England.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

The Isiac Tablet is of Bronze, the designs are inlaid upon its upper
surface, and are composed partly of silver and partly of a dark coloured
enamel, which has somewhat the tint of steel (niello work). Some
portions of the silver ornamentation are missing, perhaps they have been
removed by force for their intrinsic value, during the turbulent Middle
Ages, although it is possible they may have become loosened and lost by
accidental violence.

Around the whole Tablet is a border of small designs, or Limbus, as
Kircher called it; at each corner is a many-petalled rose-like flower,
these divide the Limbus into four portions; two vertical, a right and
left, and superior and inferior portions. Within this border there are
three principal horizontal divisions; the Upper and Lower Regions are of
equal depth, the Central Region is deeper and is further subdivided.

The Upper Region presents Twelve principal erect human figures, and
several smaller designs.

The Lower Region presents Twelve principal more or less human figures,
of whom two, the second and eleventh, are standing in porticoes; and two
others are seated, the fifth and the eighth; there are also interspersed
among these, several smaller figures; as a boy; a dog-headed human
figure, a cat, a bird, and other curious mystic designs.

The Central Region presents a Middle Grand Scene, extending over
two-thirds of the whole length, consisting of a Throned Female under a
Canopy, on each side of her is a triad. Each triad consists of a Seated
figure, a human attendant and a winged human figure; there are also two
birds in each lateral scene. At each extremity of this Grand Scene are
placed designs somewhat similar to each other; each consists of an upper
compartment, representing a Bull with two attendants, and a lower
portion representing two female figures, one on each side of a Nameless
object, whose formation can be better grasped by sight than from
description.

Between the Upper and Lower Regions runs a narrow line of Hieroglyphics,
this does not appear in the Photogravure, which from its necessarily
reduced size, would have rendered them illegible; and within the Limbus
runs all round a narrow design of wavy lines, with occasional small
flowers, vases, phalli; and masks or faces interspersed.

The Letters which appear on the Photogravure do not belong to the
Tablet; they are the reference marks adopted by Kircher in his scheme of
explanation: most unfortunately the equally excellent plate given by
Pignorius has a different set of reference letters. The only omission
from the Photogravure is that of the series of very small designs on the
plain border of the Central Canopy and its basement; these are all
similar, and consist each one of a square, a circle within it, and
within the circle four diameters dividing it into eight spaces.

It will not be necessary to describe each figure minutely, as the plate
can be referred to, and comments on each figure will be found later on,
especially in the detailed explanation of Kircher, and the shorter
references to other authors: many curious and esoteric notes and
suggestions of my own will be found scattered through this volume, and
are specially assigned to the conclusion.

The Title, heading the Photogravure, does not belong to the Tablet; it
is the superscription given by Kircher to his drawing of the Tablet, and
reads as follows:—A true and genuine copy of the Isiac Tablet, or most
ancient Brazen Tablet engraved with the Sacred letters of the Egyptians,
for the first time produced from the Museum of Torquatus Bembo, in the
year 1559, hence it is called Bembine; Æneas Vicus of Parma, published
it and dedicated it to Ferdinand Cæsar the First. Athanasius Kircher,
the Jesuit, devotes this as a monument more enduring than brass, having
reduced it to a more convenient size, he is the interpreter of the same.
Rome. 1654."

This most interesting and mysterious Tablet appears to have been
treasured in one of the palaces in Rome, at the time when the Constable
of Bourbon, in command of an army of the Emperor Charles V. of Germany,
over-ran Italy and sacked the city, in the year 1527.

It then fell into the hands of a blacksmith, or iron worker, who sold it
for a large sum of money to Cardinal Bembo. After his death it came into
the possession of the Dukes of Mantua, in whose Treasure-house it
figured as a relic of the past until 1630, when Mantua was plundered and
burnt by an army under one of the generals of the Emperor Ferdinand II.
It was then once more lost sight of, and indeed many important authors
state that it was never seen again, but was probably destroyed by some
of the ignorant soldiery, in removing from its surface the silver plates
for the purpose of sale.

There is however at least one author who gives a correct account of the
history of the Tablet after the siege of Mantua

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

in 1630; all honour to Johann Georg Keysler, who published in 1740 his
Travels through Germany, Italy, and other countries. In his account of
the Palace in Turin, he says that when Mantua was plundered, the Tablet
fell into the hands of Cardinal Pava, who made a present of it to the
Duke of Savoy, by whom it was preserved. It was finally presented to the
King of Sardinia, in whose Palace at Turin, in 1730 it was made a great
favour to him to be allowed to see it, because it was very carefully
guarded; he describes it as a pretty large copper plate, with silver
imagery inlaid, amid a blue steel enamel. He states that Pignorius’
large plate is the real size, and that Montfaucon has in his copy
inverted it. (This is an error, but Herwart de Hohemburg has done so).

The guide to Northern Italy by Murray states that the Tablet is now
exhibited in Turin at the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities: he gives as
the dimensions 4ft. 2ins. by 2ft. 5½ins. He states, without giving
authorities, that it was first discovered on Mount Aventine in Rome at a
spot where a Temple to Isis once stood. Having been again lost at the
sack of Rome it was refound in 1709 at Turin, carried away to Paris in
1797 and returned to Italy at the peace; he suggests that it was made in
the time of the Roman Emperor Hadrian.

Baedeker, also without quoting any authority, states that the Tablet was
first found in 1549 during the Papacy of Paul III at the Villa
Caffarélli at Rome.

<span class="smallcaps">Æneas de Vico</span>, who published his splendid
identical sized drawing of the Tablet in 1559 at Venice, gives the
following as the title:—

"Vetustissimæ Tabulæ Æneæ Hieroglyphicis. Hoc est sacris Egyptiorum
literis cælatæ Typus. Quem ex Torquati Bembi Musæo an. MDLIX Æneas Vicus
Parmensis edidit, ac Imp. Cæs. Ferdinando dedicavit, nunc denuo publicæ
utilitalis ergo e tenebris in lucem prodit."

This volume has no history of the Tablet, nor any attempt at
description. A second edition appeared also at Venice in 1600, published
by Jacques Franco. (Caylus prints a copy of this one.) John George
Herwart de Hohemburg has also reproduced a drawing of the Tablet in his
work "Thesaurus Hieroglyphicorum," 1610, and a diagram professing to
explain it, in his "Admiranda Ethnicæ Theologiæ Mysteria," 1625. In this
latter book he suggests that the Tablet is a sort of nautical map and
that all the figures are points of the compass.

So far as I have been able to ascertain, the oldest treatise on the
Bembine Tablet is that of <span class="smallcaps">Laurentius
Pignorius</span>, of Padua, published at Venice in 1605, entitled, "An
accurate explanation of the very Ancient Brazen Tablet, engraved with
the Sacred Figures of the Egyptians;" it is furnished with a reduced
size drawing of the Tablet.

It is dedicated to Cæsar Baronius, a Cardinal under the Papacy of
Clement VIII. Pignorius, or Lorenzo Pignoria, as he was also called,
died in 1631, but another edition of his book was published in 1669, by
Andreas Frisius; he distinguishes the figures by means of letters, and
his plate is of full size. The plate of the first edition has no letters
of reference. Very unfortunately Kircher's plate, published 1655, had a
separate and different set of reference letters, hence much confusion
has arisen. The Photogravure in this volume has the lettering of
Kircher, and my drawing is an accurate copy of the plate in the Œdipus
Ægyptiacus. Pignorius was a very learned classical scholar, and the
author of many valuable works on classical archæology, but he was
somewhat out of his depth in attempting an explanation of Egyptian
theology. His treatise in fact, is a study of Greco-Roman theology, with
many valuable classical references, apropos of the figures on the
Tablet, but is hardly an elucidation of them: he lacked the vast Coptic,
Arabic, and Hebrew information possessed by Kircher. Pignorius did not
claim to understand the Tablet, and confessed that although he
identified certain figures, he had not hit upon the design of its
author, and he does not make any attempt at a detailed description of
the plate itself, or even of all the principal figures.

<span class="smallcaps">Athanasius Kircher</span> in his <span
class="smallcaps">Œdipus Ægyptiacus</span>, A.D. 1654, has a very long
treatise explanatory of the Tablet; he commences with a short history,
and then passes on to a consideration of what use could be made of it,
deciding that it probably formed a mystic ornament in the sanctum
sanctorum, or adytum of some Temple in Egypt, for the Egyptians, like
the Hebrews, provided such secret chambers in which the priests
performed the most holy rites. Then follows a philosophical argument on
the meaning of the symbolism, but this is short, because the meaning of
each part follows later on. It embodies the doctrine of the triple
arrangement of the constitution of the world, into Archetypal,
Intellectual, and Sensible; the Paternal Mind as a centre gives motion
and animation to all things, and marks every thing with the
characteristic of Trinity.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

"The universe is regulated from the Paternal Foundation through three
triads; this Foundation is variously called—The IYNX, Soul of the World,
The Pantomorphous Redeemer, and by Philo, The Constructive Wisdom, and
exists in the perfection of triads of Pater, Potentia, and Mater or
Mens, the Father, the Power, and the Mother, or Design: co-existing with
Faith, Truth, and Love. The order, disposition, administration, and
functions of the Divine Powers are also shewn here, which are typified
by the companions and officers of the Divine and Supreme Mens, the Great
Potentia, and of the Paternal Iynx. Here are seen the Rectores Mundorum,
Rulers of the Worlds, each with his notable symbols, whether of air, or
of fire, or of material things. Here are also the Patres Fontium, the
Fathers of the Fountains, Sources, Origins, Causes, whose care and duty
it is, to decide and preserve the Principia, the dominions, the elements
of all things, and the inviolable Laws of Nature."

Here, the curious reader may perceive the Zonia, and the Azonia,
divinities not bound to any certain sphere, each with proper ornaments,
and relegated to male and female forms. Indeed the formation of the
Tablet is such that it must also be effectual as an amulet against evil
influences.

He then describes the divisions of the Tablet, which need not be
repeated here, and points out eight special points of notice in the
figures, the head-dress, clothing, wands, and weapons, hieroglyphics,
the actions implied, the position, erect or seated, and the form,
sometimes animal, at others human, in other cases, combined.

"The Egyptians considered the Divinity in two manners, as an Eternal
Existence, self-constituted and quite apart from terrestrial concerns,
or in connection with created objects which it governs by ministering
spirits, and secondary powers They admitted a Triple essence of Deity,
and also a triform secondary divinity, as they had learned of Hermes
Trismegistus. This Divinity imprinted his seal upon all earthly things,
both living and dead. Upon this same essential plan was this Tablet
constructed."

This system of Philosophy and Theosophy which Kircher associates with
the Isiac Tablet, is of an extremely occult character. It is almost
identical with that form which is ascribed to Zoroaster, as founder of
the Chaldean or Chaldaic system. It has many points in common with the
Kabbalistic scheme of the ancient Hebrews, which is known to us chiefly
through the medium of the Zohar and Sepher Yetzirah. (A large portion of
the former work is now for the first time being translated into English
and published by Mr. S. L. MacGregor Mathers, and the latter has been
translated from the original Hebrew versions by myself.) This Sepher
Yetzirah, as Eliphas Levi pointed out, throws much light on this Tablet.
The Chaldean doctrines are fully described by T. Stanley the Elder, in
his History of Philosophy, 1740.

The Eternal Being is first, with an Emanation of Light and Fire; then
powers Æviternal and Incorporeal, in three orders: 1st, Intelligible;
2nd, Intelligible and Intellectual; and 3rd, Intellectual; and lastly
Mortals.

In the second form are placed Fountains and Principles, and also Azonia,
or Unzoned Gods, not restricted to any particular sphere, and the Zonia,
or Deities restricted to special worlds; Angels and Souls succeed these.
The Pater, Potentia and Mens, so often alluded to by Kircher are
referred to the order of Intelligibles. The Iynx (this word has in Greek
several meanings—Passion, Desire, Magic Wheel, a Charm, a Wryneck Bird)
heads the second order of Intelligibles and Intellectuals, to whom
follow the Synoches and the Teletarchs. The third order includes the
Once Above, Hecate, the Twice Above, the three Amilicti, and the
Hypezocos, seven Fountains of Power. Any further attempt at explanation
would lead us too far from the object of this volume. Proclus, Psellus,
Damascius, and Porphyrius should be consulted.

Kircher then proceeds to describe and explain, as follows:—

<span class="smallcaps">The Middle Region</span>. In the centre is
placed the most important design, consisting of The Great Gate of the
Gods, an architectural canopy over a throne, on which is a seated
figure. On the top of the canopy are shewn diverging flames, below is a
globe double winged, then a second winged globe, a third is also seen
below the seat of the figure: around the sides of the canopy are a
series of squares, in which are circles with eight divisions. A column
marked with alternate black and white bands and surmounted by a head of
Isis, stands on each side of this canopy. Seated within is the figure of
a female, dressed from waist downwards with feather markings, and having
many closely placed breasts (not shewn in the drawing); on her head a
fillet, and a Numidian bird the Turkey surmounting this, on its back a
basket from which arise two Persea leaves and two horns, these latter
bound a disc on which is a Scarabæus. In her right hand is a Lotus

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

flowered sceptre and her left hand is raised in attitude of command. Her
seat is plain, but a sitting Dog is engraved on it. Below her seat is
another design, an Abacus, within which lies a monster Nepher, part
Lion, part Hawk, a Canopus between its fore paws: behind it is seen a
Globe Winged and combined with a Serpent, over its head is a crescent
Moon, 'and a sun within it. On each side of the Canopy are placed
columns, and on each is a Serpent, as if as a guard.

There are Three principal figures on each side of the goddess, each
triad O Q R on the right, and X Y Z on the left, consists of one seated
figure, and two standing ones: note that O and Z are clothed alike: R
and X next the canopy have similar pedestals, wands and head-dress: Q is
Ibis headed, and Y is a seated .female human figure.

This Central Canopy represents the diffusion of the Triform Supreme Mens
in the universal ways of the Three Worlds, from which process of
evolution this Sensible World or Universe emerges, called by Plutarch
the Borne of Horus, and by the Egyptians the Great Gate of the Gods.

The diverging flames on the summit of the canopy mean the eternal and
incorruptible supreme Mens, full of Fire, Light, and Life: the influence
is communicated to the Intellectual, Sensible, and Elementary Worlds, as
pictured by the three winged globes.

The seated figure is the Supreme Mind, or PANTOMORPHOUS IYNX Multiform
Sphynx, or Logos, Word, or Soul of the World, and is placed here in the
middle, as in the Centre of Universal Nature. The sitting posture
denotes Power and Dominion., the Dog is drawn on the seat, because the
Isiac Iynx is associated with the Dog Star, Sirius, or Sothis: the
feather winged clothing of the limbs denotes the sublime velocity of the
higher powers: the abundance of breasts denotes the unlimited powers of
creation and preservation: the necklets denote the celestial orbs in
constant movement: the fillet on the head, or covering, denotes the
hidden procedure of Nature, and the Turkey (the Numidian bird of
Martial) of many colors and spots, denotes the variety of created
things. The Basket denotes abundance, and the Persea denotes that Wisdom
which administers all events: the Horns denote the Moon, and the
Scarabæus and disc the Sun, the sceptre denotes that all things are
modelled after the [pattern](errata.htm#0.md) of the Paternal Mens, and the
Lotus means the unwearied procession alike by night and day, the raised
left hand denotes the ruling power whose every command is fulfilled.
This mother of Universal Nature the Egyptians called ISIS, of her they
indicted the inscription:—

"Ego Isis omne sum id quod est, et fuit, et erit, et meum peplum nemo
mortalium unquam retexit."

"I am Isis, I am all that is, that has been, and that will be, and No
Mortal has ever yet withdrawn my Veil."

The Squares and Quaternary, and the Octuple division of the Circles,
which form a design on the columns of the canopy, denote the numbers 4
and 8, which together produce 12, the symbol of Mundane Perfection. The
alternate dark and white spaces on the columns refer to the ever varying
vicissitudes of terrestial affairs. The two Serpents on standards are
Ophionian Agathodæmons, Good Divinities, they indicate the life of
earthly being, vegetable and animal, which need heat and moisture. The
Abacus below means the Elementary World, The Lion T with the black veil
is the Earth, the Hawk head refers to Elementary Fire: the Moon and
notable star the Sun, point out that all things below are influenced by
Luni Solar power: the Canopus means Elementary Water; a bi-partite flame
above and two feathers denote Elementary Air, meaning that Water by Heat
becomes vapour. The Kuklo-ptero-morphos, or Serpent Winged Globe means
that all this Elementary World is animated and preserved by the power of
the Supreme Triform Deity. The Elementary World is also called Hyle by
the Greeks.

The hieroglyphics of the upper set in face of the IYNX read as
follows:—The entrance to the quadripartite world, through which the
Pantomorphous Soul of the World Both enter, it penetrates all things
with the eye of divine Providence, bestows the sphere of life by flowing
both through the four parts of the superior world, and through the five
gates of the inferior. world. The lower group reads thus:—The Barrier of
the portals of the Superior and Inferior Worlds, of which the chain of
the Zones is removed by the Ibimorphous Agathodæmon. (N. B. Kircher's
translation of the hieroglyphics must be taken with all caution, as the
secret language of the hieroglyphics has been lost since the period of
the Ptolemies, until the last few years.) Orpheus has well described the
Pantomorphous Nature Mother in the lines commencing:—

Natura omnium mater Dea, artificiosa mater;  
Suscitatrix, honorabilis, multa creans Dæmon Regina.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Nature, all-parent, ancient and divine  
O much mechanic Mother! art is thine  
Heavenly, abundant, venerable Queen  
In every part of thy dominions seen.

The Two Serpent figures Y and W, with the central Sphynx T form the
Ophionian Agatho-demonic Triad, or Serpent Good Deities, the symbols of
the Pantomorphous Spirit of the World, acting in the Three Spheres,
Intellectual, Ethereal, and Elementary. Of the two lateral triads, Q and
Y are Patres seated, R and X Potentiæ, O and Z the Mentes, the faces of
all are turned towards the Great Mens.

Q is Ibimorphous, a Male divinity with the head of the bird Ibis. This
is Hermanubis, the Mercury of the Romans, Hermes of the Greeks; the Ibis
head denotes Deity of Moisture; the tesselated chair points out the ever
changing states of nature, day and night, heat and cold, etc. Orpheus
wrote:—

"Qui Mundi habenas tenet, variegatâ, sede splendidus."

"Who holds the reins of the world, splendid on his variegated throne."

The Quail pictured on the seat is a symbol of adversity, through which
the general good of the universe is consummated. The Crux ansata of the
Right Hand shows the influx of virtue from above, and the Isis headed
wand, the power delegated by Isis, Pantomorphous  Nature Goddess. Of the
head-dress the flames denote the power of heat; the serpents, life; the
feathers, velocity and subtility; and the floral centre, fecundity.

The two Crocodiles below the throne denote the evil powers of Typhon
under the subjection of the Ibis.

The eighteen divisions of the footstool denote the eighteen cubits rise
of the Nile; which confers the acmé of fertility, and the Ibis Thoth is
the Nile deity. O is the Mens of the Triad, is a female with a full
breast, she has long wings reaching to the ground, her feather wand
denotes dominion over airy powers, and the vase on the pedestal, the
nourishment by the Nile water, the hieroglyphics above read:—"The airy
good genius of all nature, communicates its power by moisture so
fecundating it." P is an Andro-sphynx, the fiery nature deity, and the
hieroglyphics read:—"The divine arbiter by his power impresses with his
seal the heavenly life." R is the executor of the commands of this
triad, he is almost naked and his legs apart as in motion on his
pedestal we read:—"He penetrates with the [greatest](errata.htm#1.md)
celerity through the celestial sphere, through the moist Kingdom of
Momphta, and the sacred Ibimorphous lakes." S is a flying Hawk it holds
a circle and a rod, and refers to the power of heat, supplied by the
archetypal Fire of the Supreme Mens.

This whole triad denotes Masculine Potency, Active agents, while on the
other hand X Y Z are Feminine, and Passive; but neither of them so in
totality, but for the present purpose; for the Egyptians considered a
deity to be bisexual, or asexual, yet becoming either active or passive,
male or female as specially required.

Here then we find the presiding Pater of the Triad to be a female, she
is Nephta, throned and with a flowery head-dress, a kneeling figure
beneath the seat, and on the pedestal is a Lion the symbol of Momphta,
the rising Nile. On her head with triple flower symbols, is a winged
scarabæus beetle, type of the fecundating power of the Sun.

Z is a similar form of Mens to O, with long wing and vase on a pedestal
before her, her breast is full of milk. X differs from R the
corresponding figure, it is a female also with the tumid breast, and a
head-dress with globe, serpents, and feathers. α and β are companion
figures, the Numidian Turkey and a Hawk.

The Iynx of Chaldea, or Soul of the World, or Paternal Word, is also
called by the Egyptians, Hemphta.

The <span class="smallcaps">Azonian Hecatine Triad</span>, L M N. This
triad contains three Mentes, named in Greek, Triecdotis, Komas, and
Ecclustiké, while the Azonian gods are Serapis, Bacchus, and Osiris. The
centre of all influxes is denoted by the head M, female with black veil
and white ears, three necklets, and a great doorway of the world on her
head. She is Isis under the form of Hecate, a type of the Great Pater,
her white ears are canine, the dog was sacred to her. She was the
faithful guardian and preserver of earthly treasures. Because the
sensible world is subject to many changes, it is marked by the Lotus
flowered column, by it are two heliotrope flowers, denoting the Solar
motion, and the particolored column also points out the alternating
states caused by the Solar motion: the column stands in a cordiform
pedestal for a mysterious reason The attendants L and N are called by
Psellus Triecdotis and Komas their breasts are pendulous with their
abundance of milk, they have triple collars, relating to the animal,
vegetable and mineral natures.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

The <span class="smallcaps">Serapean Triad</span>, ζ Zeta, η eta, and θ
theta, is named from the head of monstrous shape marked H, this is the
Pater, Zeta is the Mens, theta the Potentia: this is the Fontane triad
of Faith, Truth and Love. Serapis is the Sun below the horizon,
subterraneous, which the Greeks called Pluto and Dis, exercising
authority over all the lower world. On his head are three feathers, of
the triform deity, close by are drawn a Frog sitting on a Persea flower,
and a Cynocephalus with a Moon above its head. The attendants stand one
on each side of a similar mysterious column, as in the Hecatine picture,
and the whole has a similar meaning.

The <span class="smallcaps">Isiac Triad</span> is placed over the
Hecatine, in it we see the white and black Bull Mnevis, fecund deity of
Omnipotent Nature: and the Osirian Triad is placed over the Serapean, in
it is a White Bull or Apis, the one specially Lunar, the second Solar,
and they have a relation to agriculture. The attendant K is Triptolemus
holding a cup and a bovine phallus, G is Maro, the words above are:—The
propagator of the celestial fluid to lower beings. The other two
attendants are similar. Pignorius names the two bulls, Onuphis and
Menuphis.

Kircher then sums up the objects in the Middle Region as follows:—

The first Triad of the Fiery Archetypal World, the Triform World of
Life, and the Uncreated World bring forth seven triads,—Genii of the
Universe:—

|          |            |     |                                      |
|----------|------------|-----|--------------------------------------|
| Iyngean, | Ophionian  | or  | World of Life and Fire, Æthereal.    |
|          | Ibimorphic | or  | World of Moisture, Æthereal.         |
|          | Nephtæan   | or  | World of Fecundity, Æthereal.        |
|          | Isiac      | or  | World of the Moon, Sidereal.         |
|          | Osirian    | or  | World of the Sun, Sidereal.          |
|          | Hecatic    | or  | World of Vegetable growth, Sublunar. |
|          | Serapean   | or  | World of Subterraneous existence.    |

The Kabbalists describe Ten Worlds of which the three highest, referring
to Kether, Chocmah and Binah are concealed, and are also denoted by the
mystic A M S either male or female they also specify Four Worlds, the
Aziluth for Deity, Briah, for Archangels, Yetzirah for Angels, and
Assiah for Demons, Human beings and Matter; these possess secret names
which are OB = 72, oib; SG = 63, seg; MH = 45, mah; and BN = 52, ben.

The <span class="smallcaps">Superior Region</span>. These twelve figures
represent the Twelve Directors of the Celestial World. They are selected
into four triads, and answer to our twelve signs of the Zodiac, and
twelve months. Triad One consists of P S and V, referring to the months
whose Coptic names are Mechir, Phamenoth; and Pharmuthi, these three
constitute Winter or Mendes. The corresponding Hebrew months were
Shebeth, Adar, and Nisan or Abib: that is January 26th to April 26th
very nearly. Triad Two is X Z and A, the months Pachons, Paoni, and
Epiphi, and are Spring or Ammon; the Hebrew are Iyar, Sivan, and Tammuz,
April 27th to July 24th. Triad Three consists of B C and E, the Months
Mesori, Thoth, and Paophi, the time of inundation, Momphta, Summer; the
Hebrew months are Ab, Elul, and Tizri, July 25th to October 27th. Triad
Four consists of the months, Athyr, Choiak, and Tybi, F G and H, forming
Omphta, or Autumn; correspond to Cheshvan, Kislev, and Tebet, from
October 28th to January 25th; but Hebrew and English months do not
correspond exactly; Hebrew months begin with the New Moon.

Psellus, quoting Zoroaster, says:—After the Intelligible Divinity, named
"The Iynx," come the Directors of the Sidereal World, ruling over
elementary fire, air, and matter. Compare the Sepher Yetzirah, cap. 5,
sec. 1, where the twelve *simple* Hebrew letters are associated with the
months and zodiacal signs. The most ancient Egyptian Zodiacal signs
were, according to Kircher:—Ammon, Apis, Helitomenon and Harpocrates,
Hermanubis, Momphta, Isis, Omphta, Typhon, Nephtys, Mendes, Canopus, and
Ichton.

The later Demotic Zodiacal figures were in the same order:—A skin, bull,
shoots of a plant, scarabæus, knife, virgin, solar mountain, snake,
arrow, life, water, and fish.

In the , S the Pater, V the Mens, or Mother, and P the Potentia, form
the Triad of Mendes, the Goat, which is seen on the altar M: this symbol
refers to the fecundity of the earth ready to nourish the germs of
growth. It was customary to sacrifice goats at this season as an appeal
for a favourable season. Capricornus translated into the skies,
according to the. Greeks, refers to Mendes. Pis male, and V a female
with tumid breast, each carries a Crux Ansata token of the Apotropæum
Numen, or Intercessory Deity. These are symbolical of the Active and
Passive powers of Nature; Q and T are tablets acting as Amulets.

In the <span class="smallcaps">Second Triad of Ammon</span> X is the
Pater, Z the Mater or Mens, and A the Potentia. Note the Ram Ammon seen
above standing by a plant with three fructifying branches, symbol of the
intense and ripening heat of the season. Rabbi Jehuda in the Zohar says,
"to denote heat they drew a Ram,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the horns diverging upwards being types of flames of fire." X is Ammon
as a warrior with a lance, a Nilotic Phenicopterus in his left hand; the
is often combined with Osiris.

Z is Mother Isis to whom corn and fruit are dedicated. A the Potentia
carries an Ibis Feather in the right hand and a Vase of Nile water in
the left. (Pignorius says that the peculiar conical skirt of A is to
insinuate Priapism.)

Y, the Cynocephalus, marks the vernal equinox; below his seat are six
circles with crosses of four lines, referring to 24, because at the
equinox, when the day is 12 hours long, this animal was said *urinam
reddere* every hour through the day, and through the night 24 times.

The <span class="smallcaps">Third Triad</span>, named <span
class="smallcaps">Momphta</span>, refers to Summer, its figures are B C
and E. It is so called because Momphta is the presiding genius of Leo,
the Rising Nile, which D, the Nilotic Sphynx expresses; on the head of D
are the Crescent Moon and the Sun .dark, on the base are six quadrifid
circles, or 24 days of increase, and 24 days of decrease. C is the
Pater, an Intercessory deity, his vase shaped head-dress. is ornamented
with circles, a snake emerges from it, and above it are two hawk's
feathers and a circle; symbols of the vigour of the Sun, heat and life.
His companions are the Mens, an Isis E, and the Potentia B. E has a
white head-dress, a vase above it, then horns, star, and feathers, in
her right hand a feathered sceptre, two triangular sistra hang from it.
The horns are Isiac and the star is Sothis, whose heliacal rising
preceded the Inundation: the sceptre is a weapon against Typhon, who is
always supposed to be disturbed by music or noise. B carries an Absinth
branch, and has, a Thermuthis on her head, the Absinth, enemy of
putrifaction, was plentiful at the beginning of the month Thoth.

The <span class="smallcaps">Fourth Triad</span> is called <span
class="smallcaps">Omphta</span>, and concerns the Autumn. Omphta is the
protector of the sign Libra, a Beneficent deity, ruling when the land of
Egypt, pregnant with moisture after the inundation, is so disposed to
fecundity; it is the figure G, with the Thyrsus in the right, and the
Phallus oculatus in the left hand. The companion F holds a Cuckoo-headed
wand and in the left hand a cup of black earth, alluvium, a happy augury
for agriculture, which is referred to by the beast's tails of .F and G.
H is an Atoning deity, carrying a Lotus flower wand, to ward off attacks
of Typhon, the evil one; she also has a full breast, symbol of
fruitfulness.

The <span class="smallcaps">Inferior Region</span>. This contains twelve
principal figures, the Fathers of the Perennial Fountains, the Rulers of
the Terrestial World: these are also divided into four series of
triads—ψ Ff Hh, the Western; ξ ο Σ, the North; τ φ χ, the Southern, λ M
N, the Eastern.

The triad of the <span class="smallcaps">Great East Gate of the
World</span> presents M, the boy Horus, enclosed in the portico, he is
involved in a network, holds a wand with a Cuckoo head and a cross upon
it, and also a square and a trumpet; behind his neck hangs a triangle
with a globe emerging from it. The portico is ornamented with a Winged
Globe above, and its sides with quadrifid circles, and five pointed
stars alternately placed.

This gate admits all light, life, and motion, symbolized by the winged
globe, to the four parts of the world, and the five orders of beings.

Horus is the Sun, which confers heat and light to our earth, and rises
in the East: the network points out that its origin and powers are
hidden from our knowledge: the Cross denotes its power over the four
elements, the Cuckoo head denotes variety of production, the square
denotes order and symmetry, and the clarion, harmony: Plato calls the
triangle the symbol of the world.

The hieroglyphics on the pedestal read thus:—

"The parent of vegetable nature, preserver of moisture, the sacred
guardian of the Nile—Osiris, pantomorphous or many formed genius of
living beings and things, making them fertile."

N is a female figure filletted, with a Hawk on her head, offering five
cups to Horus; this is the Mater or Mens of the triad. The Hawk
expresses Heat and Light, and the five cups are the semina of water,
air, minerals, vegetables, and animals. She is a form of Isis. λ is the
Potentia, a female figure with a Lotus flower wand, an asp with a turgid
breast above it, and a star; in her left hand is a cup, her breast is
full. This Asp is ophionian, called Thermuthis, and means the Life and
Motion of things.

The <span class="smallcaps">Second Triad</span> is named <span
class="smallcaps">Æluromorphos</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Fontana</span>, or <span
class="smallcaps">Western</span>, and is placed at the opposite end of
the Region. Ff is the Parens, a female figure with cat's head, standing
in, a portico; above is the Winged Globe, symbol of the influx of the
Supreme Mens; around are the quadrifid circles; referring to the Mundane
world. In her right hand is the Lotus wand, in her left the Crux Ansata;
on her head are a globe; scarabæus and

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

serpent. In the West, the Sun leaving the Upper Regions, seeks the
Lower, night comes on, when Ælurus, or the Cat, with eyes specially
fitted for night use, becomes powerful The Moon then supplants the Sun,
for the Egyptians looked upon the Moon and her Rays, as the Sun's Rays
reflected from a Mirror, instead of being direct. The Crux Ansata was a
most powerful amulet or phylactery against evil powers, which are most
offensive in the darkness.

ψ the Mater or Mens, carries a wand with flowering top in the left, the
Phallus in the right, on her head is a diadem of two flames, two
feathers, two asps, and a circle or star: the phallus denotes Fecundity,
the flower head, vegetable nature, the diadem, Heat, Life, and Motion,
reflected to the Moon from the Sun.

H is the Intellectual Potency, Fecundity, in his left hand is a papyrus
stem, sign of plenty, his right hand command the wishes of the androgyne
Pater and Mens. Over his head are the Thermuthis and star,—(see above).

But this triad presents us with three extra figures, d, e, and Ω. d is a
sitting Dog, with a Sistrum, a musical instrument consisting of an oval
metal frame, with loose rattling crossbars, this designates the Horizon
destitute of solar light.

Plutarch says the horizon is Anubis, the dog headed custodian: the
sistrum is to terrify Typhon the Evil one.

Omega Ω is also Anubis the Andro-kuno-morphos, with globe, serpent, and
Ibis feather on his head; the Ibis being an enemy to the crocodile
Typhon. It is on a column, and may be compared to the Hecatine Cerberus.
e is Horus the Sun, harmony in the sensible world.

The <span class="smallcaps">Third Triad</span> is <span
class="smallcaps">Pandochæan</span>, the presidency of the genii of the
North.

The central figure is O a female seated; she has a full breast, the
Lotus flower wand, and the mark of Thoth, the Crux Ansata in her right
hand. Her seat has a chest board ornamentation, and her dress has a sort
of crux ansata scattered over it. She is seated as a ruler of the North,
which has definite limits; her variegated seat, marks the light and
shade of the Northern Sun, corruption and generation alternating. The
crux is needed as a protection from Typhonian powers, the Lotus Wand
points to the archetypal Sun. The number Nine is associated with the
North, being next to Ten, the complement of all good. First, the seat
points out alternate day and night; secondly, the vegetable fasciculus
of nature; third, the plenitude of influx shewn by the many cruces;
fourth, the Crux ansata amulet; fifth, the Lotus sceptre, the Archetypal
Sun; sixth, the Mundane cup or reservoir; seventh, the asps, the
sanctuary of seminal vitality; eighth, the cloven cross, the mystery of
the Solar Agathodæmon; ninth, the wings mark the barriers of the
intellectual virtues. On the pedestal are alternate quadrifid circles
and sets of five lines, the Egyptian symbol for the number nine.

ξ Xi the attendant Mens has the Cuckoo wand and the Crux, and Globe and
Serpents over head. Σ or Sigma the Potentia on the left of Pandochus
carries a Quail, symbol of the wicked wiles of Typhon, against which the
winged-serpent-globe, good-deity, marked a, works with constancy.

The <span class="smallcaps">Fourth Triad</span> is <span
class="smallcaps">Thaustic</span>, the presidency of the Southern genii.
The Pater, φ or Phi, is seated on a throne, ornamented like that of the
North; his right hand commands his Mens T, his left has a papyrus stem,
his head is most special, being Ierakomorphous, or like that of an Hawk.
He is seated as a Ruler, and fixes the limits southwards, the Hawk head
refers to the Solar Intelligence, life, light and spirit. He is called
Thaustus, and Baieth, which means the Heart of Life, His crown is marked
with many circles, which means dominion over many realms. The number 7
is dedicated to him, note the quadrifid circles and three lines,
recurring on the pedestal. His companion T offers him a cup of Nile
Water, and a Hawk's feather, she is clothed with a deer skin. These mean
the heat producing Southern climate, so valuable for growth; on her head
is a vase of flowers, with a statue of Hecate. This T is the
subterranean Isis, called by the Greeks Persephone, the deity of
flowers, fruit, and vegetables, and refers to the richness and fertility
of the Southern Nile. χ or Chi, the Thaustic Potentia, is also a female
figure, with body and lower limbs covered by Hawk's wings wrapped around
them: the Pharaonic bird, the Turkey, is on her head, and above it a
cup, from which emerge two Cows’ horns, with the Dog Star, Sothis,
between them. This lady is the Nilotic Isis, she is an Atoning Divinity,
the Sothis was sacred to her. Sothis is also placed over Y, the
Scarabæus with open wings. C is an Ibis with a Nilotic Vase from which
grows the Absinth or Seriphius, also sacred to Isis; it was supposed to
purify water. The Ibis is the Agathodæmon, or good genius of the Nile.

\[The South of Egypt was always held in great veneration and was called
the Lamp of Light, and the Cup of the World.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Egyptians also
called the North the Right and the South the Left of the Universe,
because the human heart sending forth vivifying blood to all the system
is on the left side, so with the Nile, the fount of all moisture and
fertility to Egypt. Osiris a Nile Deity was black like the fertilizing
Nile mud, hence Khem, Chem, Ham, words derived from the Chaldee CHM,
heat and blackness. Horus was not painted black, although the son of
Osiris. There is a mystical allusion in this blackness of the god, he is
the lower shadow of a great light one, black by contrast. Lévi says that
a great secret of the Egyptian mysteries was revealed when the neophyte
of the priesthood was told, "Osiris est un Dieu noir."—Lévi.\]

<span class="smallcaps">The Limbus</span>. Of this vast array of designs
only a limited mention can be made on account of want of space. Upper
Row. 1, a Dog sitting before a Sistrum and a vase of Nile water, and on
either side a Lotus flower and a Persea leaf, a Phallus behind and
before him. The Lotus was a white Nymphæa with narrow lily-like leaves;
its flower rose above the water and expanded at sunrise, and closed and
sank at sunset. The pendent Persea leaf is tongue shaped, its plant had
a heart-shaped fruit. The Dog is Anubis the Guardian and preserver of
the phallic fecundity of Osiris, and winged-serpent-globe is the cause
of all causes, the Supreme Mens. 2 is a Hawk with the head of Horus, the
idea of Terrestrial Providence. 3 is a Lion or Momphta, the action of
the fiery heat of the Sun upon the earth. 4 is the Phallus oculatus
adored by 5, Nephta praying for fecundity. 6 with Hawk head and Asp body
is a good deity, symbol of light, life and motion, acting under 7, a
Bovine head meaning Lunar influence. 8, a Frog upon an altar, living in
Nile Mud, was sacred to Isis, but was a type of the lowest creatures and
formation. 9 is an Androsphynx, Man Lion with a kneeling man, 10, before
him. 11, 12, 13, 14 are a boat with a Mnevis Bull and attendants; this
boat is the famous Egyptian Barys, it has a Hawk figure head, Horus with
an oar, a plant of the sacred Erica, erect Persea leaves, a square in
front of the Bull, and a guardian Ibis with a feather, and a crescent
moon on her head, a lotus flower is on the poop of the vessel, this
vessel is the vehicle of the supreme influence passing down through all
the universal paths of the world. 15, 16, 17, a worshipper is Horus,
then the Hawk is Thaustica, Solar; and a Goat's head on an altar refers
to Mendes or Simendes the Greek Pan the fertilizer. Then follow 18 and
19, the worshipper, and Ammon a Ram. 20 is a vase of Nile water used at
the festival of the entry of the Sun into Aries, or Spring. Then follow
21, a Cynocephalus, 22, a worshipper, 23, a wine bearing fountain of
Hecate, and 24, a Hawk-headed-Lion-sphynx, with a Canopus. 25, the Lion
is Osiris causing an influx over the sensible world, Horus 27. 28 is the
Luni Solar influence affecting the 29 Frog or mud, or primeval matter to
fertilize it. 30, this Sphynx is Hemphta, the Supreme Intelligence. 32,
Lion Sphynx is the Archetypal Fire. 33, Ibiform, is the Archetypal
humidity. 34, Asp Sphynx, means the genius of life, heat and motion. 36,
the Meleagris, the Genius seminalium rationum. 39, 40, 41, is a symbol
of the influx of the triform deity, or Soul of the World, upon the Sun,
Horus, and hence to the Nile by the virtue of the Leonine Momphta; the
guardians of the bed are three, the Man-headed Canopus, the Hawk-headed
Nilotic Osiris, and the Dog-headed Anubis, denoting the power of
humidity, Luni Solar influence, and guardianship. 42, the Mnevis Bull,
is the Universe. 45, 46, the conjunction of the Ibiform Nile genius, and
Leonine, Heat. 47, 48, 49, the Ship of Ammon, with Horus as guide. 50,
51, conjunction of Momphta Leo, heat, and Mendes, goat, fecundity. 52,
53, 54 Ibiform Lunar intelligence, conjoining with Solar. 55, 56, 57,
conjunction of the Anubis Mens with the Luni Solar Cynocephalus. 58 is
the Sensible World, and 59 is the Soul of the World, the Scarabæus
conjoined. 60, the Sothiac Mens, that of the Canicula or Dog Star.

The last portion of Limbus contains Atoning Deities. 61, the genius of
Horns, before the Ophionian Mens, 62. 63 is like 30 64, 65, 66, the
Hawk-headed Agathodæmon of Ormuzd, with the Mnevis Bull. 67, 68, 69, the
Ibiformed Nilotic Horus group. 70 is Anubis. 71 is a Scorpion, evil
demon, combatted by Momphta 72 and by 70. 73 and 74 denotes the war
between Horns and Typhon. The plant by 70 and 71 was called Mars, Blood;
and also Motmutin, and was a Portulaca, the title meant "delivering from
death," it was used also as a medicine to combat fevers and
inflammations.

\[The true original sphynx I believe to have been the Virgin-headed and
bosomed, Lion-bodied conception, symbol of the Zodiacal signs Leo and
Virgo, under whose influence the Revivification of Egypt by the Nile
inundation occurred.\]

In his extremely valuable work, "L’Antiquité expliquée," <span
class="smallcaps">Bernard de Montfaucon</span>, the Benedictine,
published in Paris, 1719, an engraving (said by Keysler to be inverted)
of the Isiac Tablet, and a Chapter of description is added. He deems it
to be a general sketch of the religion and superstitions of Egypt, and
appears wholly symbolical and enigmatic: it is

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

seen at once that this vast collection of figures, arranged in such a
definite manner, must shroud some mystical meaning; but when it has to
be decided whether the tablet be a history of the gods, or some system
enveloped in religious secrecy, or ceremonies, or whether the tablet has
a moral design, or even if it be a resumé of all these, hesitation is
necessary. One thing is plain; certain characters appear several times,
and act the same parts, yet the scenes are varied, as in a drama.
Montfaucon considers that the work of Pignorius, Amsterdam, 1670, gives
the most learned account, but in a suggestive rather than a dogmatic
mode; while Kircher never hesitates, and is never embarrassed for a
meaning, but M. adds, "his readers will find his account original, and
will doubt whether any Egyptian ever thought as he did."

M. describes the tablet at length, and points out that there are three
Regions, the first containing four scenes, the second three scenes, and
the third four scenes, eleven scenes as of a drama. In the First Region
he describes P as Osiris, S as a Priest sacrificing a goat to Isis, V;
then X is Osiris offering a bird to Isis Z, who gives him a cup in
return; behind Isis is a Man A holding a cup and a bill-hook; above the
bird of Osiris is the Goat of Mendes, and below is Y a Cercopithecus,
monkey. The third scene has three figures, an Osiris C between two
figures of Isis B and E. D is a Griffin sacred to the Sun. The fourth
scene completes the first band; Osiris F offers a cup to a figure G,
whom M. fails to name: H is a final Isis without doubt. He remarks that
G holds in his left hand an unknown emblem (the *phallus oculatus* of
Kircher).

The Second Region. The fifth scene represents two figures of Isis, each
holding a flower pendent from a tendril, and between them a column
surmounted by the head of a cat, or of Ælurus, and above it a basket
with handles. The Bull Apis with two priests occupy a space over this
scene. The seventh scene resembles the fifth, with the exceptions that
the Bull is Mnevis, and in the. lower compartment the cat head is
replaced by a mysterious figure head or mask.

The sixth scene is the grandest of all, and contains seven figures, the
chief actor being in the middle between two trills. This is Isis seated
on a throne between columns with an architrave and cornice; on her head
is a bird with its wings falling downwards to her shoulders, above the
bird horns and a globe. Some think this bird the Numidica gultata of
Martial, the fowl of Numidia, with spotted body. In a compartment below
her are a Griffin and a Canopus, and a Star, probably the Sun, for the
crescent Moon rests on the head of the Griffin.

The figures next Isis on each side seem like a Body-guard, and on each
side of her is also a Dragon. Next come Q Ibis headed seated on throne
over crocodiles, and Y an Osiris with a monstrous head dress, beneath
him are a Kneeling Man, and a Lion. Above him is another bird similar to
the Numidian head dress of the central figure. Two females O and Z
similar complete the scene, these also resemble Isis, and they hold in
the right hands curious sickles, which they hold over vases standing on
columns: on their heads are horns and discs, and on the discs which are
surmounted by feathers, are the mutilated organs of Osiris, these
figures have long wings; they are probably priestesses of Isis. Above
one is a Syren bird or Harpy and above the other a Sparrow.

The Third Region. The eighth scene has three persons, the central figure
is framed M, he is apparently in a net, this is Horus, au Isis is behind
him, and another before him offering a tray of goblets. The ninth scene
is Isis seated between two figures of Osiris, one of whom offers her a
bird.

The tenth scene presents Osiris seated; he is sparrow-headed, an
attendant Isis is seen on each side, one has the Numidian bird
head-dress.

The eleventh scene shows five figures, of which the chief is a Lion
headed Isis, Anubis stands before her, next comes Osiris presenting to
her a Phallus Oculatus (priapic eye), then follows Horns, and above him
appears a cat holding a Sistrum, which was an Egyptian form of musical
instrument, consisting of an oval metal frame with a handle, three or
more metallic bars passed across the oval placed loosely in holes, so
that a metallic tinkling was produced when the Sistrum was shaken: then
finally a figure of Osiris with a great Serpent on his head closes the
array.

Of the Limbus, or border of small devices, lie only gives a Catalogue,
without any explanation of their meaning.

In Dr. Samuel Shuckford's "Sacred and Profane History of the World
connected," Vol. II, p. 315, there is a discussion on our Tablet. The
author seeks to prove that it was designed before the Egyptians came to
worship images of Men and Women; because all the images before which
priests are seen in posture of adoration, are those of Birds and Beasts;
see the Border, nineteen examples; and he suggests that the worship

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of images of Men was their last and lowest form of Idolatry; the Beasts
being only symbols of the great First Cause considered in his attributes
and relations. The kneeling Priests are found in the Border only, and
not once in the main body of the plate He concludes:—(1.) That the
Border represents the several animals which were worshipped in Egypt at
a certain date, and the priests of each cult. (2.) The Table itself
pictures some of the Priests not in the act of worship, but each in some
characteristic ministration. (3.) The Animal figures associated, with
many, point out to which animal's worship. each one belonged. (4.) The
five seated figures represent eminent Priests, and are Monuments of
them; those who have animal heads instead of human are those who have
been honored with the names of the gods whose symbols they carry. (5.)
That Montfaucon has wandered unaccountably from the true explanation in
supposing many of the human figures to be Isis and Osiris presenting
goblets, and Birds and Staves to another, because no designs of any such
trifling intercourses have ever been pictured by ancient writers
respecting them

William Warburton, M.A., in his "Divine Legation of Moses," 1738
discusses the Bembine Tablet, and copies two of its figures in his
chapter on the Hieroglyphics of the Egyptians. Book IV sec. IV, p. 185.
He judges that the Tablet was made by some devotee of Isis living in
Rome, that it was one of the latest of the *old* Egyptian monuments from
the mixture of all kinds of hieroglyphics upon it and from its
*representing Isis in a galley that is as the first Cause of all
things*, which he adds was a late notion. He remarks that Jamblichus and
Tacitus teach the notion the Egyptian symbol of a Ship and Pilot always
referred to Isis and meant "the governor of the universe.

<span class="smallcaps">Paul Ernest Jablonski</span>, in his Pantheon
Ægyptiorum, 1750, makes many references to the Tabula Bembina. He
considers that the central figure represents Neith rather than Isis,
partly because the figure is seated, a characteristic of Neith in
particular, according to Eustathius, and partly because of her head
dress bearing a scarabæus on a globe. He also refers to the Canicula, or
Little Dog beneath her seat, and adds who could be more properly placed
in the middle of the tablet then Neith the Opifex or Artificer of the
World, equivalent to the Greek Minerva. to some extent.

He notes that the Thermuthis or Uræus serpent, a constant companion of
Isis, is placed each side of the central figure S, although this
Thermuthis is also a type of Tithrambo, equivalent to the Greek Hecate,
and as he says, "the just anger of the highest deities against the sins
of men." He notes Ammon as the Ram, and Harpocrates as the Sun Renewed,
with the feet closed in one case or network at the winter solstice; also
the sacrifice of the Wild Goat at the Vernal equinox, figures S and M.
The pair of designs L M N and ζ η θ are each two maidens, standing one
on each side of what is considered to be the Nilometer, the measure of
the rising of the Nile. I note that in one case they have flaccid empty
bosoms, in the other they are turgid and full of milk, denoting the Nile
Valley, at one time sterile, but after the inundation very fruitful.
Another very interesting point in this connection is the fact of Egypt,
the Nile Valley, being shewn by two women on one side of the glyph of
the Nile, and compare this with the fact the Biblical name of Egypt is
Mizraim, or MITZRIM, a dual form of MTZUR, indicating that the two banks
of the Nile constitute the country; compare also the Greek dual Μεσραιν,
mesrain. Sothis is also a title of Isis, it really meant in
Egyptian—*initium temporis*, the commencement of time, or of reckoning
time; from it is named the "Sothiac period." A Frog sitting on a Lotus
leaf was a symbol of the Decreasing of the Nile, when much invaluable
mud was left behind for agricultural purposes. The Coptic word HRUR
means both subsidence of water and frog.

The same author <span class="smallcaps">Jablonski</span> has in his
"Opuscula," collected 1807, a tractate entitled, "Specimen of a new
Interpretation of the Isiac Tablet," and also another named "A
conjecture in conclusion." These are two very learned essays, and I
cannot refrain from quoting from them, although I differ from him in
many of his conclusions: his references to letters in the plate, refer
to the edition of Andreas Frisius, so I have had occasion to change them
for those used in my Photogravure. He suggests that the Tablet was
designed in the time of Caracalla, or of the Antonines, and is a
Calendar of Festivals of the Egyptian Religion, adjusted to the Roman
divisions of the year: some Egyptian says, he designed it in Rome to
prevent his forgetting the established order of his religious
observances. It seems to form a series of symbols denoting the order of
the Feasts of the Religion of Egypt.

In the Upper Region the Central Figure seems to be intended to represent
the Rising of the Canicula, the Dog Star, Sothis, marking the
[beginning](errata.htm#2.md) of the Egyptian year, and indeed the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

division of the whole Tablet marks the division of the year into three
seasons, (Hermes Trismegistus gives three strings to the Lyre as
Diodorus Siculus remarks), Winter, Summer and Autumn, their Spring being
called "the beginning of Summer."

The first segment should represent the reign of Osiris, the rise of
Summer; the second, the reign of Isis, beginning at the Summer solstice,
and ending at the Autumn equinox; the third belongs to Horus and extends
to the Winter solstice, including the remainder of Autumn and the
Winter, until the renewal of the Sun.

In Egypt, the first day of the month Thoth was fixed by the Heliacal
rising of Sirius, the Dog Star, in Canis Minor; this marked the
beginning of their year, yet in this Tablet it is far otherwise, this
event being placed in the *middle* of the Upper Region. The Romans had
their feast of the New Sun, or the Finding of Osiris, on December 25th,
which the Egyptians kept as a feast on the 11th day of Tybi, or January
6th. Hence it seems likely that the design was intended to fix Egyptian
Feasts on the Roman Calendar, and was conceived about the date of the
Emperors M. Aurelius, Commodes, or Caracalla, A.D. 161-216. In the first
segment are P S V, by this group is signified the Vernal equinox, or the
entry of the Sun into Aries. The first figure P is Osiris, with the Crux
Ansata in his right hand, symbol of the energy of the phallus,
fecundity, and life; in his left hand a wand headed by a Hoopoe or
Lapwing, a notable bird, typifying Gratitude.

S is Horus, standing between Osiris and Isis, and sacrificing an Oryx, a
Goat with a long neck, no beard, and straight horns. A famous festival
was held at the Full Moon before the Vernal equinox, and sacrifices were
offered. V is Isis holding the Crux Ansata in the left hand X is Horus
as a hunter, with a spear and holding a bird. Y is a Cynocephalus,
meaning an equinox (the Vernal), it is ornamented with the Lunar horns,
orb, and asp of Isis. Above this the Ram of Ammon specially honored at
Thebes., it refers to the entry of Sol into Aries.

Here ends Jablonski's specimen of interpretation.

In his second essay, "The Conjecture in conclusion," he deals with e,
Omega, and Ff at the end of the Lower Region. e is Horus newly born, or
Osiris refound, which comes to the same thing, he is swaddled up with
feet together, and drawn of small size, hence the Winter Solstice. This
birth of Horus is the same event as the birth of Harpocrates at Thebes
(the 6th of Paophi). Ω or Omega, is the Cynocephalus or Anubis, the
dog-headed boy, guide of Isis in her search for her husband's mutilated
parts, and the Finder of them. Ff the Lion-headed-lady, is a form of
Isis; this head he also calls that of Cebos, a ferocious and truculent
animal: the combined personality means the Sun as the Lion head and the
Moon as Isis, the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon.

The ancient Egyptians invented and first used several Cycles, periods of
time, which have become famous. Of these, one was the Apis cycle of 25
years, another the Phœnix cycle of 500 years, but most renowned was the
Sothiac cycle of 1460 years; this latter began when the first day of the
month Thoth or Taout coincided with the Heliacal Rising of Sirius, or
Sothis, the Canicula or Dog star in the constellation Canis Minor: such
a Cycle began in B.C. 2782, another in B.C. 1322, the date of the
commencement of the reign of the Pharaoh Rameses or Menephthah, and
ended A.D. 138.

Among the ancient Egyptians, the seasons (lid not always coincide with
the same monthly periods, because the number of the days were lunar.
Their year consisted of twelve lunar months, to which they added five
intercalary days, the festivals of Hesiri or Osiris, Set or Typhon, His
or Isis, and Nebti or Nephthys. At the present time, the annual
inundation commences about the end of June, and is at its height about
the end of September.

<span class="smallcaps">Count Caylus</span>, in his "Recueil d’
Antiquités," Vol. vii., remarks:—"This monument does not seem to date so
far back in Egyptian history as the Biblical Pharaohs. As a proof of
this, notice that the arms and legs are free and show a movement rare in
the very ancient Egyptian designs: but if more recent than some extant
works of art, it yet preserves the memory of the most ancient usages to
which the Egyptians were always devoutly attached. This Tablet would
serve to fix and preserve the Egyptian theology." He notes that every
figure is drawn with the face in profile; that if the designs are not
elegant, they are ye all drawn well proportioned; and that all are adult
persons, except the son Horus. The great distinction between the figures
conferred by the various headdresses, is noticeable, because on account
of the heat of the climate, so simple a form of clothing was necessary,
that differences of rank could not be represented by the body dress. The
use of special batons and sceptres, as shewn in the Tablet, lead him to
believe that the use of them arose in Egypt. All the seated figures are
probably Divinities, either

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

superior or inferior, for if a priest be drawn sitting, he has no
special head-dress.

Commencing at the centre—Group One. Isis is found seated on a Throne,
under a Canopy: the Serpents on either side of her are of the sort
called Theban Nasser or Ophilinus, or flying serpents, they are not
venomous; perhaps these are-male and female: before and behind Isis are
found triads of figures, each triad an inferior deity, or monument of
some notability, between two other figures. There are also two Birds
aloft on each side of the Isis. Caylus makes no attempt to name or
explain any of these figures.

Groups Two and Three are similar, the first behind the Isis, represents
the Bull Apis, that on the opposite side the Bull Mnevis. Each Bull has
a manger and two attendants. Apis is being offered two goblets, Mnevis
only one. Apis is marked with a moon on the back and has a symbolic
collar, and between the horns a disc with one marking; Mnevis has two.
Apis is the Lunar, and Mnevis the Solar Bull. Below these Bulls are two
other similar designs, one below each. These consist of two females, one
on each side of an elevation; they at least have female breasts, but are
otherwise like men in stature and dress. Above the elevated statue
arrangement is in each case a head and face, very notable as being the
only ones in the whole Tablet not drawn in profile. The bearded figure
is called the Egyptian Dionysus or Bacchus, the female head is not
named. He doubts whether the central ornaments be Nilometers, and notes
that they are not alike in the number of their markings, one having 24
and the other 19 only.

In the First Segment, P S and V form a Fourth Group, occupied in the
sacrifice of a Goat, or Gazelle; the priest slaying the animal is seen
by the head-dress to belong to the cult of Y, the seated Deity facing
the central [Iynx](errata.htm#3.md); V is a priestess, not a deity, and P
is a soldier or guard, bearing on his head the same dress as that of the
seated Ibis-headed deity Q; the altar M is peculiar and deserves study.

The Fifth Group, X Z A, point to the cult of the Ram, and of the Dog Y.
The Ram is an emblem of Jupiter Ammon. X is a soldier and so is A, both
have but little clothing. The clothing of Z is star-spotted, and she
wears a Deer skin.

The Sixth Group, B C E, show a worship of the Sphynx; note the Lion I).
The Seventh Group shows no object of adoration; the Priestess of Isis,
H, is administering an oath to two soldiers, F G.

Lower Region. Group Eight. M is Horus in a Temple entrance, cased in
like a mummy. The lady λ bears a wand with a Serpent named Theban
Nasser, the other attendant N bears a hawk on her head. Note that all
the three canopies of the Tablet have the truly Egyptian form tapering
upwards, the sides not vertical. Group Nine. ξ is a soldier. ο the
seated goddess, is Isis or Nephta. Group Ten. The central Hawk-headed
figure φ Phi, is consecrated to Isis, the others T and X are attendants.
Group Eleven. Here we have a Dog-headed lady, erect under a canopy, and
two attendants with an Anubis. Caylus describes the figures of the
Limbus as forming Twenty Groups.

The Abbé <span class="smallcaps">Banier</span>, in his work, "Mythology
Explained by History," 1738, devotes a chapter to the Isiac Tablet. He
summarizes the views of Pignorius, Kircher, and Chifflet, and adds, that
to him it seems a Votive Tablet which some worshipper had consecrated to
Isis in return for some success or favour attributed to the goddess: it
represents three forms of offerings to Isis, animals, plants, and
libations, varieties which the giver had perhaps himself made use of.
Such Votive Tablets were very common in the temples of pagan deities, as
Juvenal notes. Satire XVIII.

Et quum votiva testantur fana tabella  
Plurima, Pictores quis nescit ab Iside pasci.

The great English masonic authority, the late Kenneth Mackenzie always
took a great interest in the relation of the Tablet to modern tripartite
craft masonry.

The late Dr. Kenealy made researches into the hidden meaning of the
Bembine Tablet. He explains the Roses at the corners, each of twelve
petals as symbolizing the Twelve Incarnations of the Holy Spirit, the
Twelve Messengers from God to Man, who form an important feature of his
doctrines of theosophy. He also notes a figure compounded of Goat
(Deity), and Lamb (Messenger), with a mystic badge on the right shoulder
indicative of the Female, or Holy Spirit nature.

Winckelmann, the great modern German Egyptologist, does not believe in
Warburton's opinion that the Tablet was made in Rome, for he justly
remarks that hieroglyphics are never found on pseudo Egyptian designs
made by the Romans.

I have obtained what may be considered the opinion of the most advanced
School of Egyptology of the day. Professor Le Page Renouf, of the
British Museum, courteously explained his views to use. lie said he was
of opinion that the Tablet

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

was not designed by an ancient Egyptian, but in Roman or Mediæval times,
by some one conversant with Egyptian monuments, who had selected the
figures from various sources; that the ornamentation around the designs
was not Egyptian, but more modern; that very few of the figures were
those of well-defined divinities; and that the hieroglyphics were either
badly copied, or intentionally disfigured, and that they are practically
illegible even to himself and others, who can decipher the inscriptions
on the ancient monuments of Egypt; and lastly, that he had failed to
discover any scheme or design in the representation, neither of the
series suggested to him any grouping geographical, theological, or
astronomical. He was further of opinion that the curious design seen in
figures and called by old authors Phallus oculatus, had no generative
signification, but that these were the mystical eyes, which rather
referred to the points of the horizon, North and South. Other modern
scientists consider these Right and Left Eyes to typify the Sun and the
Moon. The chapters of the Egyptian "Ritual of the Dead," present no
scenes like those of the Tablet, but one chapter treats of the Adoration
of the Mystical Eyes. In connection with the curiously designed symbol,
called by Kircher, the Phallus Oculatus, because it seems to combine the
phallus and a human eye note that Paamylia was an Egyptian Festival
resembling the Greco-Roman Phallophoria. Some authorities refer it to
the worship of Osiris, because of his mutilated phallus; others,
objecting that Osiris was not an ithyphallic god, refer the festival to
the worship of Khem; at any rate, it was at these festivals that this
symbol was honored specially.

Such is a brief summary of the opinions of the learned men who devoted
special attention to our Tablet. The extreme divergence of these views,
and other considerations, have led me to conclude that the Tablet was
not intended to serve any public purpose, but was intrinsically and of
design without meaning to the ordinary Egyptian, or worshipper of Isis
whether in Greece, Rome or by the banks of the Nile.

The designer arranged his figures and his symbols for an Esoteric
purpose; he was doubtless a priest of the Cult of Isis, and happily
succeeded in embodying his ideas of religion, cosmogony and astronomy in
a form which has truly proved a masonic secret, a stumbling block to the
uninitiated. It is a gross absurdity to suppose that any man capable of
designing such a Tablet, over which immense energy, research, and
knowledge must have been expended, to say nothing of the skill displayed
in its execution, should have wasted his abilities in perpetrating a
gigantic hoax: for that is I suppose what some modern writers mean who
call it a "forgery;" but a *forgery* is a *deceitful imitation*, how it
can be called an imitation considering that its special character is
that of being different to any other stele or Tablet known, is not
clear; and how it can be a deceit is also incomprehensible since it
bears no name or date purporting to refer it to a definite author or
period. On the other hand, if we assign to it an esoteric purpose, the
mystery is explained, and the attention of true students of Occultism
and of the Ancient Mysteries is ipso facto fixed upon it. The precise
date and place of its manufacture will probably never more be known, but
from the internal evidence afforded by the ornamentation, and the
peculiarities of the hieroglyphics, it seems that its age cannot be
anterior to the Persian conquest, circa 500 B.C., it might be reasonably
assigned to the Ptolemaic period, say about 300 B.C. It is certainly not
the product of Egypt after the Saracen invasion, 638 A.D. There seems no
doubt its existence was first made known in Italy, and it must have been
abstracted from a Temple of Isis either at Rome, or some other city
where the Egyptian deities were worshipped, but even if that be so, the
Tablet may yet have originated in Egypt itself, and may have been
transferred to a new foreign temple, possibly as a valuable relic.
Although it is obviously intimately related to Isis and to Egyptian
views of Astronomy, there is a notable absence of any reference to the
Osirian and Isiac myths directly, there is no war of Osiris and Typhon
depicted, no mutilation, no sign of the journeyings of Isis in search of
her dead lord. There is a notable absence of the most usual designs of
Isis, and especially of Osiris (see the pictured forms in Bunsen and
Wilkinson). There is no Tamarisk tree, and there are no fish
represented, and no musical instruments but one small Sistrum at d in
the lower region. Very few of the best known of the great gods of Egypt
are recognisable as such, there are no Ammon Ra, ithyphallic Khem,
Khons, Harpocrates with the finger on his lip, Seb, nor Sutech, so that
the Tablet is not a diagrammatic Pantheon. Almost all authorities agree
on an astronomical explanation of the Upper Region, the Middle Region
exhibits a supreme Numen, Divinity, surrounded by six others, these
refer to the very ancient set of seven Planetary deities, anal seven
lower Sephiroth, Then on each side are Nilotic figures: the one, the
Nilotic alluvium, passive, the other bursting into fecundity; over these
the Solar Bulls. The Lower Region shews four scenes, of three characters
each, of these scenes two have the principal enthroned,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

and two principals are canopied. The Limbus exhibits a series of acts of
worship, and tutelary deities.

There are three representations which are conspicuous by their absence,
namely the Four Genii of the Dead, Amset, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Kebhsnauf;
the 42 Assessors of the judgment after death, and also any
representation of the scene in the hall of judgment; some part of these
allied, figures are found in a very large. number of Egyptian drawings,
which form the designs of the 125th Chapter of the Per-M-Hru, or Ritual
of the Dead.

There are a few notable figures to which modern research has assigned
certain meanings, which I must mention, but of course these may not have
been introduced here in this esoteric Tablet with those meanings. As to
Crowns, the Crown of V is the Het Crown of the Kings of Upper Egypt,
that of λ is the Techi Crown of the Kings of Lower Egypt, that of Σ and
φ, the Pschent Crown of Entire Egypt; figure H in Upper Region, has the
Crown of Osiris, the Atef. The face H in the Serapean triad is the mask
and plumes of Bes, who was a Typhonic and priapic god. V and W, the
Serpents, have the Crowns of Nisham and Eilitheia, goddess of Upper and
Lower Egypt. Neither of the Bulls have the true marks of Apis, white
triangle on forehead, vulture on back, white crescent on shoulder, and a
cross on the flank. The two Boats of the Limbus are the Morning Barque
of Ra, the Rising Sun, and the Evening Barque of Tum, the Setting Sun. T
the Hieracoleontisphynx is called Nepher. The figure H has the
hieroglyphics of the name Isis, followed by a Snake, which is a
determinative of the names of goddesses. Figure 53 of the Limbus is the
Phœnix, or Phenicopterus, the Benno of Osiris. 55 is the Cercopithecus,
or Hapi, the Ape, similar to the Hindoo Hanuman.

The Nilotic Sphynx was an emblem of the world and *year*, and symbol of
Concealed Wisdom; the Greek Neilos, is N = 50, E = 5, I = 10, L = 30, O
=70, S = 200. Total 365 days.

The Winged Globe, and Serpent holding a rod with three knots, is
sometimes called Kneph, and is. said to have represented almost our
modern idea of the Holy Ghost, it occurs at α near O and many times in
the Limbus, it is the Arcana Divinæ Essentiæ, the globe denotes
immensity and eternity, the wings universality, the serpent life, the
sceptre dominion, the knots are unity, equality, connection and mutual
harmony. But Kneph was also a Ram-headed god, and V is almost identical
with Sati his wife, who is close to the Ram over the X. M in the lower
row said by Kircher to be Horus, renewed Osiris, much resembles Ptah,
and F is also similar to his wife Pasht or Bast. χ is Hathor. T of the
Inferior Region is drawn as Nehamao, daughter of the Sun and Lady of
Tentyris. The figure marked by S in the Superior Region resembles
Merula, last of the incarnations of Ammon. The greek small l or lambda
marks the figure of Neith, or Minerva. Y over T in the inferior region
is the Scarabæus Beetle called Khepra, and it meant the Creative energy
of the Sun, and was also a type of Resurrection from the Dead.

Some authorities have suggested to me a Geographical interpretation,
into the 36 Nomes of Egypt, each showing a special deity, but an
attentive study of the subject has not induced me to accept the theory.

Horapollo wrote that by the Serpent the eternal life of the gods was
meant; by the Hawk, a Bird with opened wings, air or wind; and by
Canopus, or Canopic jars, usually three, was conveyed the Rise of the
Nile water.

With these remarks, I am compelled by want of space to conclude the
result of my studies of the history and exoteric view of the meaning of
the Tablet: I now pass on to devote a few pages to suggestions of a
recondite or esoteric explanation.

My comments on the hidden and mystical meaning of the Tablet will be
fitly introduced by a reference to the works of Eliphas Lévi, and I must
apologize for a digression into the occult purpose and significance of
the Tarot. With any critic who has made no special study of the Occult
Sciences, I must with the learned Postel, plead: "Lector, quisquis es,
aut perlege et si potes perpende et intellige, aut abstine a censura."

I enter with extreme diffidence upon any representation of the opinions
of the late Alphonse Louis Constant, better known as Eliphas Lévi; but
give a short resumé of his own words, and point out the special
character of the diagram he supplies. He was a philosopher entirely sui
generis, nature has made such minds but rarely, and doubtless years must
pass away before we see his like again.

His deep and earnest grasp of Kabbalistic lore, almost of itself puts
him beyond any ordinary criticism, while his heartfelt enthusiasm for
the Higher Magic carries conviction to the minds of readers, even when
our ordinary natures pause on the limits of exoteric teaching, and
hesitate to plunge into the paths of the Unknown. To any person who has
not grasped, I do not say—has not read, the "Dogme et Rituel," no
explanation

of his opinions would be comprehensible; to those who have grasped the
Occultism of Lévi, his view of the Tablet is an Unveiling of its Secret,
and the Tablet becomes a Pantacle. It is matter of satisfaction that his
works are still procurable in the Original, because the only English
version, that of Mr. Arthur Edward Waite, although a judicious and
skilful *translation*, is sadly marred by a re-arrangement of the
chapters, and even of the paragraphs, which changes have in many
instances reveiled even those secrets which Lévi had illumined by his
wisdom, and initiates will be apt to conceive that the translator,
although able, was himself outside the veil—an uninitiate.

In the "Histoire de la Magie," Lévi wrote:—"The most curious, and at the
same time the most complete key to the Tarot, or modern version of the
famous Book of Thoth, is found in the Isiac Tablet of Cardinal Bembo,
which has been represented by Kircher in his work on Egypt: this learned
Jesuit has divined, without being able to establish complete proof, that
this Tablet contained a key in hieroglyphics to the sacred alphabet. It
presents to us three groups of designs, above the twelve celestial
mansions, and below the twelve laborious periods of the year, and in its
central portion the twenty-one sacred signs, which correspond to the
letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In the middle of the central portion is
seated the Image of the Pantomorphous IYNX, an emblem of Universal
Existence, corresponding to the Hebrew letter Jod or I. Around the
central Iynx are placed the Ophionian, or Serpentine triad; these three
forms refer to the Three Mother Letters, A, M, and S of the Hebrew and
Egyptian Alphabets. On the right side of the Iynx are placed the
Ibimorphous and Serapean triads, and on the left those of Nephta, and of
Hecate; symbols respectively of:—

<div align="center">

|                      |     |                       |
|----------------------|-----|-----------------------|
| The Active           | and | the Passive.          |
| The Volatile         | and | the Fixed.            |
| The Fecundating Fire | and | the Generative Water. |

</div>

Each pair of triads in conjunction with the Iynx form a Septenary, the
centre itself contains a Septenary. Titus the three Septenaries present
us with the absolute number of the Three Worlds, and the complete number
of Primitive Letters; to which is added a complementary sign, just as to
the nine numerals is added a Zero. The ten numerals added to the
twenty-two ancient letters form the Thirty-two Ways or Paths of
Kabbalistic doctrine."

This is all that Eliphas Lévi writes directly about our Tablet; but he
adds a diagram, or plan of the whole Table, except the Limbus or Border,
and this diagram tells a more occult tale to the attentive student, it
presents an even more esoteric view of the matter, which he has not
thought fit to explain in words. Doubtless he considered that to the
wise the diagram would speak sufficiently plain, and to the profane no
explanation could carry instruction; hence I feel much hesitation in
lifting the veil he has thought fit to leave over the subject; but at
the request of the Editor of the series of Bath Occult Reprints, I
proceed to give a glimpse within the Veil of the Saitic Isis.

The diagram of Lévi, by which he explains the mystery of the Tablet,
shows the Upper Region divided into the four seasons of the year, each
with three signs of the Zodiac, and he has added the four-lettered
sacred name, the Tetragrammaton, assigning Jod to Aquarius, that is
Canopus, He to Taurus, that is Apis, Vau to Leo, that is Momphta, and He
final to Typhon. Note the Cherubic parallel—Man, Bull. Lion, and Eagle.
The fourth form is found either as Scorpion or Eagle depending upon the
Occult good or evil intention: in the Demotic Zodiac, the Snake replaces
the Scorpion.

The Lower Region he ascribes to the twelve *simple* Hebrew letters,
associating them with the four quarters of the horizon, compare the
Sepher Yetzirah, cap. v., sec. 1.

The Central Region he ascribes to the Solar powers and the Planetary. In
the middle we see above, the Sun, marked Ops, and below it is a
Solomon's Seal, above a cross; a double triangle Hexapla, one light and
one dark triangle superposed, the whole forming a sort of complex symbol
of Venus. To the Ibimorphos he gives the three dark planets, Venus,
Mercury,

BARON SWEDENBORG says:—"The ancients who were versed in the science of
correspondences made themselves images which corresponded with things
celestial and were greatly delighted therewith by reason of their
signification, and that they could discern in them what related to
Heaven and the Church, and therefore they placed those images both in
their temples and also in their houses, not with any intention to
worship them, but to serve as a means of recollecting the celestial
things signified by them."

"Hence in Egypt and in other places they made images of calves, oxen,
serpents, and also of children, old men, and virgins; because calves and
oxen signified the affections and powers of the natural man; serpents,
the prudence and likewise cunning of the sensual man; children,
innocence; old men, wisdom; and virgins, the affections of truth, &c."

"Succeeding ages, when the science of correspondences was obliterated,
began to adore as holy, and at length to worship as deities, the images
and pictures set up by their forefathers because they found them in and
about their temples."—"An Hieroglyphic Key to Natural and Spiritual
Mysteries," 1792. Editor.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

and Mars placed around a dark triangle erect, denoting Fire. To the
Nephthæan triad he gives three light planets, Saturn, Luna, and Jupiter,
around a light inverted triangle which denotes Water. There is a
necessary connection between water, female power, passive principle,
Binah, and Sephirotic Mother, and Bride. (See the Kabbalah by S.L.M.
Mathers.) Note the ancient signs for the planets were all composed of a
Cross, Solar Disc and Crescent: Venus is a cross below a Sun disc,
Mercury, a disc with a crescent above and cross below, Saturn is a Cross
whose lowest point touches the apex of the crescent, Jupiter is a
Crescent whose lowest point touches the left hand end of a cross: all
these are deep mysteries. Note that Lévi in his original plate
transposed Serapis and Hecate, but not the Apis noir and Apis blanc,
perhaps because of the head of Bes being associated by him with Hecate.
Note that having referred the 12 simple letters to the lower, the 7
double must correspond to the central region of the planets, and then
the great triad A.M.S. the mother letters representing Air, Water, and
Fire remain to be pictured, around S the Central Iynx, or Yod, by the
Ophionian Triad the two Serpents and the Leonine Sphynx. Levi's word OPS
in the centre is the Latin Ops, Terra, genius of the Earth; and the
Greek Ops, Rhea, or Kubele (Cybele) often drawn as a goddess seated in a
chariot drawn by lions, she is. crowned with turrets, and holds a Key;
see frontispiece to "Asclepios," Bath Occult Reprint.

The Apis Bull was the image of the Sun, on earth, and Serapis was the
Solar Bull deified after death; Serapis is a shortened form of
Osiri-apis.

The Isiac Tablet, writes Lévi, is a Key to the Ancient Book of Thoth,
which has survived to some extent the lapse of centuries and is pictured
to us in the still comparatively ancient set of Tarocchi Cards. To him
the Book of Thoth was a resumé of the esoteric learning of the
Egyptians, after the decadence of their civilization, this lore became
crystallized in an hieroglyphic form as the Tarot; this Tarot having
become partially or entirely forgotten or misunderstood, its pictured
symbols fell into the hands of the sham diviners, and of the providers
of the public amusement by games of Cards. The modern Tarot, or Tarocchi
pack of cards consists of 78 cards, of which 22 form a special group of
trumps, of pictorial design: the remaining 56 are composed of four suits
of 10 numerals and four court cards, King, Queen, Knight, and Knave or
Valet; the suits are Swords (Militaryism), Cups (Sacerdocy), Clubs or
Wands (Agriculture), and Shekels or Coins (Commerce), answering
respectively to our Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds. Our purpose is
with the 22 trumps, these form the special characteristic of the pack
and. are the lineal descendants of the Hieroglyphics of the Tarot. These
22 correspond to the letters of the Hebrew and other sacred alphabets,
which fall naturally into three classes of a Trio of mothers, a Heptad
of doubles, and a Duodecad of simple letters. They are also considered
as a triad of Heptads and one apart, a system of Initiation and an
Uninitiate. These Tarots are named:—

These are the Names of the Tarots, I now add some hints of their
significance:—

Certain other cards of the Tarot Pack have also borne special Names:—The
3 of Coins was Osiris; the 3 of Cups, Isis; the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 2 of Cups, Apis;
the 9 of Coins, Hermes; the 1 of Wands, the Serpent, Apophis; the 1 of
Coins, the Sun, Apollo.

It is necessary to see and study a set of the most ancient Tarots to
appreciate the essentially Egyptian character of their symbolism.

The dogmas of the Sepher Yetzirah also form a perfect Tarot. The Three
Mothers, which are:—1. Aleph, Air, the Firmament, the Holy Spirit. The
Human Respiration, the Chest. 13. Mem, Water, the Earth, the Belly, the
Womb. 21. Shin, Fire, the Heavens of Stars and Suns, the Brain, the
Head. These are represented by the Centre of the Isiac Tablet. The seven
doubles which correspond to the planets, and the median part of the
Isiac Tablet:—2, Beth, Luna, Nature; 3, Ghimel, Mars, Force; 4, Daleth,
Sun, Fertility; 11, Kaph, Venus, Generation; 17, Pe, Mercury, Wisdom;
20, Resh, Saturn, Peace; 22, or O, Tau, Jupiter, Beauty, and the Twelve
Single, corresponding to the Zodiacal signs, and the Upper Region of the
Isiac Tablet

I can strongly recommend a study of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of
Formation, as one of the most ancient philosophic schemes of Theosophy
known to us. It is far older than the Kabbalistic Zohar.

The Symbolism of the Tarot scheme is further continued into the 56 cards
of the Four Suits: these suits are associated with many most important
quaternaries: and first with the letters of the Sacred Name we call
Jehovah or Yehveh, IHUH; next with four cherubic figures Lion, Man,
Eagle and Bull; then to the Four Elementary States, Fire, Air, Water and
Earth; further with the mystical letters of the inscription of the
Cross, INRI; with the letters of the Hebrew word TORA the Law; with the
occult significance of the ROTA or Wheel of the learned Postel: and
lastly with sexual design and its emblems, Creator, Phallus, Masculine,
Aaron's Rod; Great Mother, Yoni, Cteis, Female, Womb; thirdly with the
Lingam, Conjunction, or with the Sun; and lastly Female, Circle, Shekel,
Pantacle, Vesica Piscis, Image of the World, Malkuth, Kingdom.

Club or Wand,—I, Yod, Male, Phallus, Lion head, Fire. Mind.

Heart or Cup,—H, He, Female, Yoni, Human head, Air. Soul.

Spade or Sword,—U, Vau, Male, Lingam, Eagle head, Water. Spirit.

Diamond or Coin,—H. He, Female, Vesica Piscis, Bull head, Earth. Body.

The four suits are named in France, Trefles, Piques, Cœurs and Carreaux.

Then lastly the four sets of ten numeral cards, represent the Ten
Sephiroth multiplied by the letters of the Tetragrammaton, or in the
four Worlds of Aziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and Assiah: thus the four Aces
become the fourfold Kether, the four Twos the fourfold Chocmah, and so
on to the four Tens which typify Malkuth.

From a study of these analogies and correspondences, and the symbolic
associations, it will be obvious how a system of Divination arose,
because each card of the whole series of 78 had a meaning direct or
symbolical; for example the 7 of Cups (hearts) would mean the Netzah of
He or the Victory of the Woman, and the 3 of Clubs the Binah of Yod the
Understanding of the Creator.

Another curious mystery may be casually mentioned here:—How comes it
that some of the Court Cards are invariably drawn with the faces in
profile and others of full front faces; the profile are the King of
Diamonds or Coins the left, the Knave of Hearts, Cups the left, and the
Knave of Spades Swords the right profile. Number 4 of the Tarots, the
King, is a profile—we trench here upon one of the most hidden dogmas of
the Kabbalah, for Macroprosopus is always designed as a Right Profile,
while Microprosopus is drawn of full face, he is the Vau of the
Tetragrammaton. The figure of the Hindoo Addha Nari is usually drawn
holding in the two hands the four emblems of the Tarot pack, wand and
cup in the right hand, sword and circle in the left—but enough of the
Tarot.

In conclusion, I cannot refrain from quoting the words of Hermes
Trismegistus, to be found in his Dialogue of Asclepios (see "Bath Occult
Reprint"):—

"O Ægypte, Ægypte, religionum tuarum supererunt  
 fabulæ, eæque incredibiles posteris tuis."

"O Egypt, Egypt, there will remain of thy religions,  
only vague legends which posterity will refuse to believe."
