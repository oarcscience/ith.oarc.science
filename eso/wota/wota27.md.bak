### XXVI.

<span class="smallcaps">I am</span> tired and sick of the cry, I can't
do this and I can't do that. The world cares only for what thou canst
do.

Show the world, then, that thou art capable of doing something.

No man ruled by "I can't" ever amounted to anything.

It is possible for the man who says "I can" to conquer and rule the
world.

Receive then, oh, soul, thine own message! Be true to its light and the
shadow of "Can't" will never cross thy pathway.

Art thou merely a creature of circumstances, ruled in all thy thoughts
and actions by the stars?

Shame on thee, if such be thy thought!

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arise in the
dignity of the god thou art intended to be, and rule in the universe
that is thine own.

Instead of thou being subject to the stars, they should obey the
mandates of thy will.

The sturdy oak-tree, sound at its core, is rocked and swayed by the
hurricane that sweeps over it, but when the storm has passed, undaunted
it lifts once more its branches toward the heavens.

Thou mayst be rocked and swayed, oh, man, by influences both mundane and
celestial, but learn to keep the equipoise of the soul.

Many times thou wilt be disturbed by others even in the life thou art
living. Remember thou mayst disturb others.

Let these disturbances and these annoyances fall off from thee. Rise,
and in the majesty of thy spirit show that thou art superior to these
things.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

Neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant things are the all-important
ones in life. As results tower aloft above all experiences, so do
motives become by far more important than acts.

Trials are good for thee when thou art not conquered by them. They lift
the curtains to many a window and reveal in part the workings of the
soul within.

Be patient; the universe was not made by thee, neither were the men and
women in it.

Let them alone, to either live their own lives or become victims of
unseen vampires.

It is enough for thee to look out for thine own life, for it is a most
difficult thing to keep clear from all the snares that surround thee.

Rise out of the realm of *I can't* into that of <span
class="smallcaps">I can</span>, and then shall all the divine
possibilities of the soul be revealed unto thee.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Only truth should sway and bend thee; only the wings of love and mercy
uplift thee, and only justice dictate thy course.

Out of strife shall come peace, and out of the performance of the most
unpleasant and unwelcome duties of life come rest to thy soul.
