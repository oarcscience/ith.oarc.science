### XXVIII.

<span class="smallcaps">Neontu</span> asked the Master: Why is it that I
am affected by all individuals that come into my presence, not only
mentally but also physically? Some give me the sensations of peace and
joy, while others almost completely destroy my equilibrium? It is not
necessary for me to come into mental communion with people to be thus
affected, neither is it necessary for me to come into physical contact
with them.

The Master walked some little distance by the side of Neontu before
replying to his interrogations. All this time he was noting the change
that was rapidly stealing over the physical body of his companion. When
they met that morning Neontu's body was terribly agitated, as if all the
chords of his being were

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

swept by a storm. But now all the nerve currents were calmed and brought
under the control of the peace-loving Soul that dwelt within.

Then spake the Master: A moment ago, oh, Neontu, thou wast restless as
an untamed steed, but now thou art calm as a philosopher. These
conditions have been brought about by the mental states of others. Thou
hast seen some delicate piece of mechanism affected not only by every
change of temperature but also by every passing cloud. The most
sensitive and delicate piece of mechanism when compared with the human
body is crude and unresponsive. Not only one but many spirits may cause
this sounding board to vibrate. Ever the dominant chord should be struck
from within. But through ignorance and lack of spiritual growth it is
often struck from without. Therefore the body is often

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

swayed by other mental states than those of its own spirit.

Understand, oh, Neontu, that everything in the universe has its own
aura. Rocks, trees, flowers, animals and human beings, each have the
characteristic aura. We have now only to deal with auras of human
beings. The color and nature of this aura is determined by the mental
and moral states of the individual. In the gross and sensual it is dark
and repulsive; around the purely intellectual it is blue; those reaching
toward the spiritual, golden; and the truly spiritual, of dazzling
whiteness. Generally speaking, no person is all gross and sensual, and
no one in the physical body at all times purely intellectual or
spiritual. Therefore in the aura of every person there must be a
blending of different colors. The predominating color determines the
bent of the individual. In disturbed mental

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

states the aura is disturbed. In anger the aura becomes dark and through
these clouds are fitful flashes of flame-colored light. At other times
love sways the whole being and the aura takes on the roseate tints of
the morning. These auras extend perceptibly about three feet in every
direction from the individual. But the sphere of their influence no one
yet has been able to measure. So, Neontu, when thou comest into the
presence of individuals of pronounced mental states, thou art affected
by their auras.

Protection can only come from within. Thou must be self-centred and
self-poised; thy will upon its throne, and thine own aura well defined
by deeds in keeping with the higher attributes of the spirit.
