### XI.

<span class="smallcaps">Upheavals</span> toward perfection are met
everywhere in the universe.

Yet matter has its metes and bounds; these are determined by indwelling
spirit.

As the child fashions out of wet clay various forms and gives to them
names that suit its fancy, so do the Archangels determine the forms
world-stuff shall assume.

At the approach of these mighty geniuses the formless assume shape and
the depths of space become vocal with the everlasting song of progress.

Trace the history of one globe and the march of progress is revealed.

All forms emerge from darkness into the light.

Night hangs her sable curtains before the enchanted chamber of
transformation.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Darkness ever hides the formless, and light ever reveals the radiant
forms of beauty.

For vast æons of time was the world preparing for the advent of man.

Myriad forms of life paved the way for his coming.

Every form of life prophesied the coming of the higher.

When man came, weak and lowly though he was, yet within his soul lay
dormant infinite possibilities, and these declared his home from afar.

While through evolution may have come the outward man, yet the spirit
was not born through the gates of many deaths, but came from the heights
or depths of the universe, leaving behind the shining pathway of its
glory.

Its mission to subdue and conquer a new world, to pass through struggles
and experiences,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

that in time it may hold within itself the results of all experiences.

By devious pathways the spirit marches onward—its life here but one of
its many expressions, and, although much of the life is seemingly
unimportant and trivial, the whole is essential when viewed from
celestial heights.

Ask not now the reason of certain experiences in life, but wait
patiently until the revelation comes from the spirit within.

Grieve not over the past, and sigh not for lost opportunities. No
opportunity that was really thine has ever been lost.

Let the Now be the better on account of the past. Rise, oh, soul, out of
all thy shadows!

He who spends his time grieving and lamenting over the past lets the
golden opportunities of the Now slip by unnoticed.

Arise, then: be not controlled and swayed by phantoms that stretch their
hands from out

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the past. Be superior to all experiences, making all to serve the divine
purposes of the spirit.

If ye stay in shadows it is because ye will to do so. The sunlight is as
much yours as any one's. Then arise, oh, royal soul, and claim it as
thine own.

That which is really thine no one can take away from thee. Thou mayst be
deprived of chattels and lands, for these never were really thine own.

But the fruitage of the spirit, the results of many experiences, thine
inheritance from the ages, is thine forever, and none can deprive thee
of it.
