<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span> who entertains the truly religious life and takes pleasure only in things spiritual has already become immortal.</p>  
<p>That which is gross and material is not forbidden him, but instead he rises above it and it becomes repulsive to him.</p>  
<p>From the eminence he has gained he can never fall, because he has gained it by his own efforts.</p>  
<p>He will require less and less food for the support of his physical body because he draws more and more of his sustenance from the <i>akasa</i>, or ether.</p>  
<p>Through sublimation the outward is becoming more and more rarefied, and the spirit, asserting itself more and more, scintillates through and around the outward in an aura</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></p>  
<p>suffused with a blending of amethyst and topaz light.</p>  
<p>Through efforts of the will he arises to those heights where disease and suffering are known no more.</p>  
<p>The body is swayed by mental states as the trees of the forest are rocked by hurricanes.</p>  
<p>Let thy mental states be peaceful ones, free from anger, hate, selfishness and thoughts of disease, and health shall be thine.</p>  
<p>Thy power is infinite; then, why be conquered by things which are inferior to thee?</p>  
<p>Let them have no place in thy mind. Drive them out with higher and worthier thoughts.</p>  
<p>Think health, live in the atmosphere of health, and thou shalt be strong and well.</p>  
<p>Thought is the mighty sculptor that shapes and fashions thy body. By individual effort thou canst bring it completely under the control of the will.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Learn the secret of concentration, and all that the soul desires shall be thine.</p>  
<p>Keep a fixed purpose in thy mind, and no matter how unattainable it may seem to the world, in time it shall be thine.</p>  
<p>Nothing can withstand the power of spirit. The soul possesses the power of drawing unto itself everything it needs.</p>  
<p>Sayest thou that the one thing needed lies afar in the depths of space, and thinkest thou the spirit cannot reach it and draw it unto itself?</p>  
<p>Be not too certain of this, for the spirit knows neither time nor space. That which seemeth to thy finite vision afar, may be near unto the spirit.</p>  
<p>Not only does the spirit recognize its own but it calls its own unto itself.</p>  
<p>What ye would have, strive after, and in time it shall be thine.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_48"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 48</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But the wise man strives after that which is good and pure, and these things become the bright gems that stud the crowns of immortal spirits.</p>
