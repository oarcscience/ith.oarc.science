### VIII.

<span class="smallcaps">I speak</span> the universal language of the
spirit, and in time all men will hear me and understand. The language of
the spirit translates itself into all dialects.

The stars speak the same language to all men, yet are they ever
understood, for the truths they voice are heard of the spirit.

Likewise the prophet uses the universal language of spirit.

If he spake in one dialect his message would be lost to many men. But if
he speaks in that which is universal his message is never lost.

He strikes the chords of sympathy and love that must vibrate in time in
every human soul.

He does not stop to argue, but from the heights he has attained
announces what he perceives to be true.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

He is above all controversy, and will not discuss that which he knows to
be true.

Out of the many discussions and controversies of men come the Babel-like
confusion apparent in the so-called sciences and religions of the world.

The prophet calls to his own, and his own know his voice.

What if he dwells on mountain heights? He is not afar from the hearts
and souls of men. For the spirit knows neither space nor time.

He draws unto himself those who are led of the spirit to approach him.

His voice unto them is like sweetest music and his words are the wingéd
arrows of love.

His thought finds lodgment in their souls and produces in due time the
harvest of perfected lives.

The strongholds of ignorance and superstition

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

are overthrown from within and not from without.

The world throws aside its old garments no longer of service to
humanity.

Customs outgrown, rites once held to be sacred disappear simply because
the vitalizing spirit is withdrawn.

Foolish is the man who has no more profitable labor than to batter down
the old.

Leave it alone and soon it will fall, for spirit is slowly but surely
withdrawing from it.

Speak boldly thy message to the world! Not as one angered with thy
fellow-men, but as one whose heart is fired with love and goodwill.

Then shall thy words live in the world, and thy message become a living
power that leads to good.

One might as well find fault with the snail because he travels not with
the fleetness of the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

horse as with the theologians whose eyes see no glory save that of the
past.

In time the snail will acquire the agility and fleetness of the horse,
but it may be millions of years hence. Nature does not censure the
snail, but awaits with patience its slow but inevitable progress.

Then, oh, man, be possessed of the patience of Nature. Wait, and thou
shalt perceive that the theologian has felt the thrill of eternal
progress.

If thou art a prophet of the soul thou shalt perceive what is to be, and
the equanimity of thy soul shall not be disturbed by the slow progress
of the world.
