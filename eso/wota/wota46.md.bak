### XLV.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> vision of the spirit I beheld the man
that is to be! He who wearily had climbed up through the ages until he
had reached the summit of physical development.

Beneath him lay Error's mangled form and by its side that of
Selfishness.

All the passions were under the control of the magic wand of Reason.

And even the emotions which to-day rock and sway the strongest of men
bowed in humble allegiance to the indwelling consciousness.

No longer a creature of circumstances and a prey to the unseen vampires
of the ethereal realms, for the inmate of this perfected form had become
master of himself.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

In the man of the yet-to-be, the spiritual nature in its unfoldment will
always be in advance of the development of the physical.

All outward things are correspondences or results of things that are of
the spirit—therefore the physical state is determined from within. All
growth is from the centre toward the circumference, and man's physical
body is not an exception to this law that obtains throughout all
universes.

One of the most marvellous manifestations of spirit-power is presented
in the physical development of this man.

Here the house will always indicate the nature and attributes of its
inmate.

The mind encased in the physical body can hardly conceive of anything
more beautiful than the perfected physical body, through which at times
flashes the light of indwelling spirit.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

Well may this house be termed a temple fit for the habitation of Omn!

Fresh from the Master's hands, perfect in the adjustment of all its
parts, it throbs and pulsates with the all-pervading light that is
eternal!

The fire that ever burns upon the altar of the soul has been kindled by
the hand of Omn, and shall die out only when Omn ceases to glow and burn
as the central fire of all universes.

Beneath his feet smoulder the fires of earthly lust, greed and
selfishness, but over his head, like a coronet fit for an immortal god,
glow forevermore the stars of Faith, Hope and Love.

Faith in all the true, beautiful and good time has gathered up as his
most sacred treasure;

Hope, kindling the fires of Charity, inasmuch

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

as it compels all to perceive that good is the final goal of all, and

Love, whose influence, the divinest of all, causeth man to work no evil,
but to do good even to the humblest and meanest of all created things.

Blessed trinity, whose light shall become brighter and brighter in the
world, until the love of my and mine shall be lost in that deeper love
of the All, that shall foster in every human heart a sense of the
brotherhood of all, that shall yet usher in the Golden Age foretold by
seer and prophet of every race and age the world has seen or man has
ever known.

The age when man shall own no master save that of his own spirit, bow at
no altar save that over which the stars of Truth and Reason never set,
and offer to the Unspeakable One only that worship which consists

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

in the doing of that which is right and good.

Then shall appear what I beheld in the vision of the spirit as the man
that is to be!
