### XIX.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Illuminated One is he whose spiritual
faculties have all been quickened. This the one whose illumination is
perfect. Of course there are many degrees of illumination.

One faculty may be quickened into newer and higher life while all the
others remain in their natural or in a dormant condition.

But when I say Illuminated One, I mean one whose faculties have been
exalted or quickened.

He, truly, is an <span class="smallcaps">Avatar</span>, for all
knowledge is placed at his disposal.

Memory opens to him the door of all experiences in past embodiments.

Oft-times he uses knowledge that has been brought from afar.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

Think not that all the knowledge revealed through illuminated ones was
acquired either in one embodiment, or while attached to one world.

Spirit calls no world home, but has been a traveller from remotest time
along an infinite journey.

Yet, caprice and fancy play no part in these wanderings.

Law controls all things, and order reigns throughout all universes.

The life that is is willed to be by Higher Powers.

What if some say, This is the only life, the first and last incarnation?

Do not stop to dispute with them. Thou canst not make them see as thou
seest.

Wait, and they will grow to thy thought.

But keep not thy thought to thyself. Utter it in world language and it
shall vibrate on

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and through the world until all prejudice shall be overcome, and souls
shall become responsive to its harmonious notes.

Study thine own soul, ponder well its lessons, before thou art ready to
accept the lessons that others may offer.

If thou art illuminated, thou wilt assimilate the food thy soul needs.

Give raiment, material food and shelter to the physical body, but give
the soul unmeasured love and knowledge.

Open all the storehouses of Nature and wrench from her her time-honored
secrets, ransack the universe if thou wilt in search of new truths, but
if thou wilt only be patient and wait, these shall all come to thee.

For the soul knows its own and draws all things it wishes unto itself.

Be ye content with fewer things in the

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

external world, and seek to draw unto thee the higher ideals of the
spirit.

But despise not the means that leadeth to the coveted end.

Perform the duties of every-day life uncomplainingly, for these may be
made the stepping stones to true spiritual growth.
