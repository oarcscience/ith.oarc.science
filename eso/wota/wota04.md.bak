### III.

<span class="smallcaps">Purple</span> and gold are the mountains of
Sebas-thā-ontu; above hang wavy billows of golden fleece; for he that
giveth life to all terrestrial things, mighty Thā, sleeps in the Chamber
of the West.

The valleys are filled with purple mists and gloom, for the arrows of
Thā no longer speed on their course.

The night winds laden with the heavy perfume of a thousand plants soothe
the restless breast of man, and seal down his eyelids with a kiss.

Sleep, the shadow of death, is abroad in the land, and all is quiet,
save the shrill note of the night bird and the voices of innumerable
insects.

Behold the grandeur of the heavens! The

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

crown that Omn wears sparkling with innumerable gems.

The soul is filled with awe and reverence at the majesty of the scene.

All that the natural eye beholds pales into insignificance before the
illimitable depths and numberless globes of amethyst, purple and gold
that burst upon the bewildered vision of the spirit.

Who made these chariots of fire that circle forever the throne of the
Infinite One?

Ever on and on! from chaos to nebulæ,—from nebulæ to suns, from suns to
worlds!

Who the mighty Sculptor that shaped the endless variety of forms?

Who the mighty Artist with brush dipped in molten colors made the
heavens shine with new lights unknown before?

What mighty Musician gave to each star and sun its keynote, and made the
heavens

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

vocal with a new song voicing the majesty and glory of the One,
Everlasting Omn?

The Heavens give answer: Our Creator is Spirit.

Archangels are the servants of Omn. They, the framers and builders of
universes. They, the sculptors, artists, musicians, incomparable.

In their hands chaos assumes form. The lightnings are their playthings.
All the mighty and subtle forces obey the mandates of their wills.

They make the pathways for circling spheres of fire. They determine when
worlds shall be born out of these spheres, and shape and fashion them
into things of exquisite beauty.

Their work completed, angels of light are placed over them and become
the masters of their destiny.

Innumerable spirits do the biddings of these

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

angels. And thus from angels to spirits, and from spirits to man
terrestrial, throbs and beats forever the Life that is that of the
Eternal One.

One Life in all and through all! One purpose, that of the Divine Will,
pulsates in every atom, making through all a most perfect undertone of
harmony.

Purple and gold are the mountains of Sebas-thā-ontu, as the shades of
evening settle over the earth. Peace, sweet peace, spreads her wings
over all, and the questioning spirit of man rests ere it takes again its
upward flight.
