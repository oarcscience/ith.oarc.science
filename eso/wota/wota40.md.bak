### XXXIX.

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> soul is an hungered and it lifteth up
its voice to the angels, yea, even unto the Infinite, pleading for food
such as earth giveth not.

Every oracle and every book in the world faileth to give me the supply
my soul needeth.

These all give freely of what they possess, yet my soul hungereth and
thirsteth for the food and drink of the higher spheres.

The thirsty trees lick up the waters that fall from the heavens, and
their hungry roots draw from Nature's breast sustenance, and they are
satisfied.

Yet, oh, God, my spirit is never satisfied with what Nature giveth, no
matter how bounteous the supply.

Even the granite rock crumbles to powder

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

that it may feed the lichen that clings to its bosom.

And the great deeps hold a bounteous supply for all the myriad forms of
life that swarm in their caverns.

I thirst, oh, God, for the great draughts of light that flood the upper
heavens, and I hunger, oh, God, for the ripe fruitage of the ages.

Let me drink in the light that leaps from star to star, from universe to
universe, until every chamber of my soul is flooded with unwonted light
and glory.

Let the wisdom of the angels and archangels appease the hunger of my
soul.

In the midst of darkness, surrounded by clouds of sable, I cry out for
light! I stretch out my hands towards the heavens and I lift up mine
eyes that they may behold the glory of Thy creations!

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

Worlds without number burst upon my vision; suns beyond human
calculation flash and flame along the Eternal Ways.

Beneath all is dark, above all is light. Then, oh, my soul, be lifted up
into realms celestial!

Let that calmness and peace steal over thee that the world on account of
its passion and ignorance fails to receive.

As I cry out, voices from out the silence answer the voiceless cry of
the spirit.

As I stretch out my hands the very heavens reach down toward me.

As I lift up mine eyes, lo, the heavens are ablaze with light for my
spirit.

Truly may I cry out:

All, all that is, is for me!

The spaces are for me,

The light is for me, and

The Voiceless Silence mine own!

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Blessed indeed am I, for all blessings are for me. If one helps my
brother or sister, I am likewise helped.

Even in the remotest corner of the world a deed of kindness done unto
the humblest of the children of men is done unto me.

Every good act, every good thought, no matter when or where uttered,
blesses me.

I am not so narrow as to be blessed only by that which is done directly
to me, but so broad that the universe alone is large enough for me,
therefore, whatsoever of the good the universe holds touches me
somewhere.

In me blend all races!

In me smoulder the loves and the aspirations of every age.

In me, the orator, the poet, the philosopher, the artist, the musician,
the seer, the prophet—all either are now or have been expressed.

When I cry out for light, it is not so much

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

for myself as for others, for the blessing comes not so much in the
receiving as in the giving.

Like a crystal reflect all light that comes to thee, and then shall the
light of thine own soul become more and more brilliant.
