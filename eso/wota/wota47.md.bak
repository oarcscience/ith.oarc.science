### XLVI.

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> spake Neontu: Oh, Master, I would
seek the easier pathway. My feet are torn and bleeding, and my heart is
sore from many a dagger thrust. Why labor for others to make their
pathway easier while ours lies over the untrodden fields and up the
steep and trackless ascents? The multitudes are but slaves that bow and
kiss the hands that oppress whilst they either spurn or strike the hand
outstretched to bless and assist them. Why not go on our way, as thou
hast already taught, alone, and leave them to stumble along as best they
may?

When Neontu ceased speaking, the Master turned toward him with a smile,
and said: Oh, Neontu, how canst thou have ease of mind without freedom
and self-government?

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And how canst thou
obtain these unless thine every duty is performed? If the smallest duty
is neglected ease cannot come to thee. The man who governs himself is
the one who is willing to forego much of the so-called pleasure of the
world provided that thereby his life may prove a blessing unto others.
No man is self-centred and consequently self-governed unless he heeds
every dictate of the soul. The soul speaks not merely for the one, but
for the all.

No man can afford to have plenty while poverty is all about him, neither
can a man afford to be negatively good and pure because he keeps himself
away from all that is unclean and impure. The pure can touch and handle
the impure and unclean and not be polluted thereby. Thou mayst infuse
the best qualities of thy life into those who are impure and unclean,
and thus be able to lead them step by

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

step away from all that impedes the upward journey of the soul.

Can thy soul be at ease in any other walk of life than that which it
prompts thee to take? Certainly, I did say, thou must blaze out thine
own path, but whilst thou art doing that, nothing hinders thee from
becoming a light unto others. Thou mayst lead them to a knowledge of
self. Thou mayst lift the clouds that hang over them, and reveal the
fire that burns forever on the altars of their souls. Thou canst not
make the path for their feet to walk in, neither canst thou compel them
to walk in any especial path. Thou mayst show them a more excellent way
and thus become a means that leads to their advancement.

In the doing of good and also the leading of others to do good, thou
wilt find ease thou canst not find, search as thou wilt, in any other
way.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Thy feet torn and bleeding! If thou findest thy rightful path thy feet
will not longer press upon thorns and jagged stones. If thou art only
self-centred and self-governed, the poison arrows of malice and envy
will no longer pierce thy heart. Thou art too firmly centred in thine
own selfish desires to rise to those altitudes where malice and envy can
harm thee no longer. <span class="smallcaps">Do the good and right not
because thou expectest to be rewarded for thy services with the smiles
and kindly words of the recipient, but because the doing of the good and
right brings its own reward in the satisfaction it causes to permeate
thy whole being</span>. Stop not to think what others may say or do, for
thou canst never find valid excuse for doing wrong in the thought that
the multitudes love that which is evil.

Rise, oh, Neontu, to that sublime height

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

of the soul [where](errata.htm#0.md) thou wilt no longer feel the waves of
contention and strife rolling over thee, but by thee and around thee and
through thee shall sweep the breath of Omn on its eternal way, bearing
the message of peace and love to all souls who have conquered the lower
nature and have attained the freedom that is that of the self-governed.
