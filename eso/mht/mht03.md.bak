F THE UTMOST SIGNIficance to all students of Freemasonry and the occult
sciences is this unique manuscript *La Très Sainte Trinosophie*. Not
only is it the only known mystical writing of the Comte de St.-Germain,
but it is one of the most extraordinary documents relating to the
Hermetic sciences ever compiled. Though the libraries of European
Rosicrucians and Cabbalists contain many rare treasures of ancient
philosophical lore, it is extremely doubtful if any of them include a
treatise of greater value or significance. There is a persistent rumor
that St.-Germain possessed a magnificent library, and that he prepared a
number of manuscripts on the secret sciences for the use of his
disciples. At the time of his death . . . or disappearance . . . these
books and papers vanished, probably into the archives of his society,
and no trustworthy information is now available as to their whereabouts.

The mysterious Comte is known to have possessed at one time a copy of
the Vatican manuscript of the Cabbala, a work of extraordinary
profundity setting forth the doctrines of the Luciferians, Lucianiasts
and the Gnostics. The second volume of *The Secret Doctrine* by H. P.
Blavatsky (pp. 582-83 of the original edition) contains two quotations
from a manuscript "supposed to be by the Comte St.-Germain". The parts
of the paragraphs attributed to the Hungarian adept are not clearly
indicated, but as the entire text deals with the significance of
numbers, it is reasonable to infer that

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

his commentaries are mystical interpretations of the numerals 4 and 5.
Both paragraphs are in substance similar to the *Puissance des nombres
d’après Pythagore* by Jean Marie Ragon. The Mahatma Koot Hoomi mentions
a "ciphered MS." by St.-Germain which remained with his staunch friend
and patron the benevolent Prince Charles of Hesse-Cassel (See *Mahatma
Letters to A. P. Sinnett*). Comparatively unimportant references to
St.-Germain, and wild speculations concerning his origin and the purpose
of his European activities, are available in abundance, but the most
exhaustive search of the work of eighteenth century memoir writers for
information regarding the Masonic and metaphysical doctrines which he
promulgated has proved fruitless. So far as it has been possible to
ascertain, the present translation and publication of *La Très Sainte
Trinosophie* affords the first opportunity to possess a work setting
forth . . . in the usual veiled and symbolic manner . . . the esoteric
doctrines of St.-Germain, and his associates.

*La Très Sainte Trinosophie* is MS. No. 2400 in the French Library at
Troyes. The work is of no great length, consisting of ninety-six leaves
written upon one side only. The calligraphy is excellent. Although
somewhat irregular in spelling and accenting, the French is scholarly
and dramatic, and the text is embellished with numerous figures, well
drawn and brilliantly colored. In addition to the full-page drawings
there are small symbols at the beginning and end of each of the
sections. Throughout the French text there are scattered letters, words,
and phrases in several ancient languages . . There are also magical
symbols, figures resembling Egyptian hieroglyphics, and a few words in
characters resembling cuneiform. At the end of the manuscript are a
number of leaves written in arbitrary ciphers, possibly the code used by
St.-Germain’s secret society. The work was probably executed in the
latter part of the eighteenth century, though most of the material
belongs to a considerably earlier period.

As to the history of this remarkable manuscript, too little,
unfortunately, is known. The illustrious Freemasonic martyr, the Comte
Allesandro Cagliostro, carried this book amongst others with him on his
ill-fated journey to Rome. After Cagliostro’s incarceration in the
Castle San Leo, all trace of the manuscript was temporarily lost.
Eventually Cagliostro’s literary effects came into the possession of a
general in Napoleon’s army, and upon this officer’s death *La Très
Sainte Trinosophie* was bought at a nominal price by the Bibliothèque de
Troyes. In his *Musée des Sorciers*, Grillot de Givry adds somewhat to
the meager notes concerning the manuscript. He states that the volume
was bought at the sale of Messena’s effects; that in the front of the
book is a note by a philosopher who signs himself

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "I.B.C.
Philotaume" who states that the manuscript belonged to him and is the
sole existing copy of the famous Trinosophie of the Comte de
St.-Germain, the original of which the Comte himself destroyed on one of
his journeys.The note then adds that Cagliostro had owned the volume,
but that the Inquisition had seized it in Rome when he was arrested at
the end of 1789. (It should be remembered that Cagliostro and his wife
had visited St.-Germain at a castle in Holstein.) De Givry sums up the
contents of *La Très Sainte Trinosophie* as "Cabbalized alchemy" and
describes St.-Germain as "one of the enigmatic personages of the
eighteenth century . . . an alchemist and man of the world who passed
through the drawing rooms of all Europe and ended by falling into the
dungeons of the Inquisition at Rome, if the manuscript is to be
believed".

The title of the manuscript, *La Très Sainte Trinosophie*, translated
into English means "The Most Holy Trinisophia" or "The Most Holy
Three-fold Wisdom". The title itself opens a considerable field of
speculation. Is there any connection between *La Très Sainte
Trinosophie* and the Masonic brotherhood of *Les Trinosophists* which
was founded in 1805 by the distinguished Belgian Freemason and mystic
Jean Marie Ragon, already referred to? The knowledge of occultism
possessed by Ragon is mentioned in terms of the highest respect by H. P.
Blavatsky who says of him that "for fifty years he studied the ancient
mysteries wherever he could find accounts of them". Is it not possible
that Ragon as a young man either knew St.-Germain or contacted his
secret society? Ragon was termed by his contemporaries "the most learned
Mason of the nineteenth century". In 1818, before the Lodge of *Les
Trinosophists*, he delivered a course of lectures on ancient and modern
initiation which he repeated at the request of that lodge in 1841. These
lectures were published under the title *Cours Philosophique et
Interprétatif des Initiations Anciennes et Modernes*. In 1853 Ragon
published his most important work *Orthodoxie Maçonnique*. Ragon died in
Paris about 1866 and two years later his unfinished manuscripts were
purchased from his heirs by the Grand Orient of France for one thousand
francs. A high Mason told Madam Blavatsky that Ragon had corresponded
for years with two Orientalists in Syria and Egypt, one of whom was a
Copt gentleman.

Ragon defined the Lodge of the *Trinosophists* as "those who study three
sciences". Madame Blavatsky writes: "It is on the occult properties of
the three equal lines or sides of the Triangle that Ragon based his
studies and founded the famous Masonic Society of the *Trinosophists*".
Ragon describes the symbolism of the triangle in substance as follows:
The first side or line represents the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

mineral kingdom which is the proper study for Apprentices; the second
line represents the vegetable kingdom which the Companions should learn
to understand because in this kingdom generation of bodies begins; the
third line represents the animal kingdom from the exploration of which
the Master Mason must complete his education. It has been said of the
Lodge of the Trinosophists that "it was at one time the most intelligent
society of Freemasons ever known. It adhered to the ancient Landmarks
but gave clearer and more satisfactory interpretations to the symbols of
Freemasonry than are afforded in the symbolical Lodges". It practiced
five degrees. In the Third, candidates for initiation received a
philosophic and astronomic explanation of the Hiramic Legend.

The Egyptianized interpretation of Freemasonic symbolism which is so
evident in the writings of Ragon and other French Masonic scholars of
the same period (such as Court de Gabelin and Alexandre Lenoir) is also
present in the figures and text of the St.-Germain manuscript. In his
comments on the Rite of Misraim, called the Egyptian Rite, Ragon
distinguishes 90 degrees of Masonic Mysteries. The Ist to 33rd degrees
he terms symbolic; the 34th to 66th degrees, philosophic; the 67th to
77th, mystic; and the 78th to 90th, Cabbalistic. The Egyptian
Freemasonry of Cagliostro may also have been derived from St.-Germain or
from some common body of Illuminists of whom St.-Germain was the moving
spirit. Cagliostro’s memoirs contain a direct statement of his
initiation into the Order of Knights Templars at the hands of
St.-Germain. De Luchet gives what a modern writer on Cagliostro calls a
fantastic account of the visit paid by Allesandro and his wife the
Comtesse Felicitas to St.-Germain in Germany, and their subsequent
initiation by him into the sect of the Rosicrucians—of which he was the
Grand Master or chief. There is nothing improbable in the assumption
that Cagliostro secured *La Très Sainte Trinosophie* from St.-Germain
and that the manuscript is in every respect an authentic ritual of this
society.

The word *Trinosophie* quite properly infers a triple meaning to the
contents of the book, in other words that its meaning should be
interpreted with the aid of three keys. From the symbolism it seems that
one of these keys is alchemy, or soul-chemistry; another Essenian
Cabbalism; and the third Alexandrian Hermetism, the mysticism of the
later Egyptians. From such fragments of the Rosicrucian lore as now
exists, it is evident that the Brethren of the Rose Cross were
especially addicted to these three forms of the ancient wisdom, and
chose the symbols of these schools as the vehicles of their ideas.

The technical task of decoding the hieroglyphics occurring

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

throughout La Très Sainte Trinosophie was assigned to Dr. Edward C.
Getsinger, an eminent authority on ancient alphabets and languages, who
is now engaged in the decoding of the primitive ciphers in the Book of
Genesis. A few words from his notes will give an idea of the
difficulties involved in decoding:

"Archaic writings are usually in one system of letters or characters,
but those among the ancients who were in possession of the sacred
mysteries of life and certain secret astronomical cycles never trusted
this knowledge to ordinary writing, but devised secret codes by which
they concealed their wisdom from the unworthy. Each of these communities
or brotherhoods of the enlightened devised its own code. About 3000 B.
C. only the Initiates and their scribes could read and write. At that
period the simpler methods of concealment were in vogue, one of which
was to drop certain letters from words in such a manner that the
remaining letters still formed a word which, however, conveyed an
entirely different sense. As ages progressed other systems were
invented, until human ingenuity was taxed to the utmost in an endeavor
to conceal and yet perpetuate sacred knowledge.

"In order to decipher ancient writings of a religious or philisophic
nature, it is first necessary to discover the code or method of
concealment used by the scribe. In all my twenty years of experience as
a reader of archaic writings I have never encountered such ingenious
codes and methods of concealment as are found in this manuscript. In
only a few instances are complete phrases written in the same alphabet;
usually two or three forms of writing are employed, with letters written
upside down, reversed, or with the text written backwards. Vowels are
often omitted, and at times several letters are missing with merely dots
to indicate their number. Every combination of hieroglyphics seemed
hopeless at the beginning, yet, after hours of alphabetic dissection,
one familiar word would appear. This gave a clue as to the language
used, and established a place where word combination might begin, and
then a sentence would gra dually unfold.

"The various texts are written in Chaldean Hebrew, Ionic Greek, Arabic,
Syriac, cuneiform, Greek hieroglyphics, and ideographs. The keynote
throughout this material is that of the approach of the age when the Leg
of the Grand Man and the Waterman of the Zodiac shall meet in
conjunction at the equinox and end a grand 400,000-year cycle. This
points to a culmination of eons, as mentioned in the Apocalypse:
"Behold! I make a new heaven and a new earth," meaning a series of new
cycles and a new humanity.

"The personage who gathered the material in this manuscript was

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

indeed one whose spiritual understanding might be envied. He found these
various texts in different parts of Europe, no doubt, and that he had a
true knowledge of their import is proved by the fact that he attempted
to conceal some forty fragmentary ancient texts by scattering them
within the lines of his own writing. Yet his own text does not appear to
have any connection with these ancient writings. If a decipherer were to
be guided by what this eminent scholar wrote he would never decipher the
mystery concealed within the cryptic words. There is a marvelous
spiritual story written by this savant, and a more wonderful one he
interwove within the pattern of his own narrative. The result is a story
within a story."

In the reprinting of the Freneh text of the *Trinosophia*, the spelling
and punctuation is according to the original. It has been impossible,
however, to reproduce certain peculiarities of the calligraphy. In some
cases the punctuation is obscure, accents are omitted, and dashes of
varying lengths are inserted to fill out lines. The present manuscript
is undoubtedly a copy, as "Philotaume" stated. The archaic characters
and the hieroglyphics reveal minor imperfections of formation due to the
copyist being unfamiliar with the alphabets employed.

The considerable extent of the notes and commentaries has made it
advisable to place them together at the end of the work rather than
break up the continuity of the text by over-frequent interpolations.

*La Très Sainte Trinosophie* is not a manuscript for the tyro. Only deep
study and consideration will unravel the complicated skein of its
symbolism.Although the text matter is treated with the utmost
simplicity, every line is a profound enigma. Careful perusal of the
book, and meditation upon its contents, will convince the scholar that
it has been well designated "the most precious known manuscript of
occultism."
