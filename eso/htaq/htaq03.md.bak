"Master," he said, "why should it require the breaking of the heart in order to bring God nearer to us?" "My dear child," replied Rabbi Simeon, "the heart of man is ruled by a multitude of powers; their hold upon it is due to Karmic debts, and every attachment is an obligation of past lives. The ineffable light of the Holy One cannot shine through us until these obligations are discharged. It requires a transparent medium to reflect a flame; dense and opaque bodies do not transmit the light falling on them.

### I.

### THE VESSEL IN WHICH TRANSMUTATION TAKES PLACE

Man is fearfully and wonderfully made; he is the meeting point of
descending and ascending nature; the arena in which the mighty Gods
fight their battles, and principalities and powers strive for mastery
over it.

The nature of man is so intricate and complex that even this physical
constitution alone has not been exhaustively explored as yet.

There are still chambers within chambers and regions within regions,
mysterious and unknown. Now if this is so the physical body, which is
plainly visible to our senses and the organs and parts of which can be
touched and handled, what about our mental and spiritual natures which
are much more subtle and more elusive?

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

If we lack certainty as regards the body [terrestrial](errata.htm#1.md),
how great must our ignorance be when we approach the celestial vehicles?

And yet we cannot say we are without knowledge regarding our higher
nature, and much has been given to this generation for which preceding
ages longed and yearned in vain. Knowledge has been flowing into our
minds for the last four or five decades which has dispersed both the
superstitions of the Dogmatic Churches and the arrogant Dicta of the
official scientists. But knowledge, no matter how plentiful and
profound, is no remedy for human ills, unless it is accompanied by love
and by the desire to apply it to its proper use. On the contrary, of two
ill-disposed persons the one who knows most is the more dangerous
because as his weapons are sharper, they can do more harm.

And, in fact, it so happened that with the advent of knowledge, its
abuse grew apace, and side by side with the good, which it brought into
the world, it gave birth to all sorts and conditions of evil.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

The great mistake made by the seekers of knowledge, a mistake which
proved most fatal to their spiritual welfare, was that they sought
knowledge for its own sake. This was bound to result in failure and to
frustrate the very object of their search. Man's mission on earth is to
attain freedom; lie must be freed from all that binds him to earthly
associations. This endeavor is the supreme task of man individually and
of humanity collectively. The alchemists of old illustrated this
pilgrimage of man towards liberation by their various processes,
tinctures, and manipulations. Their vessels, laboratories, metals and
transmutations were so many names for the one and the same thing,
namely, the illumination of the human soul and her redemption from
matter. The well-known saying, "To dissolve and to coagulate" meant
nothing but to tear asunder the bonds of passion binding the soul to
matter and having dissolved even the most subtle threads of desire and
attachment, to turn the life stream upwards and to coagulate it with the
pure elements of the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soul. The vessel
in which this process takes place is the body of man. This vehicle of
manifestation is the crucible in which the pure gold is tried and
proven, the alloy and the dross burned away, so that only the sterling
substance remains

The human body is the real cross upon which crucifixion takes place.
Each Ego chooses its own kind of cross according to its special need. If
our body happens to be weak and handicaps us in life's race, it is not a
misfortune, a misfortune though it seems.

It may be awkward from a material point of view, but looked at from the
higher vistas of the spirit it is invariably a blessing and contains
some great lesson of which the Ego is in dire need.

It must therefore be borne in mind that while transmutation takes place,
and until it is complete, the vessel, which is the body, must needs
suffer from the effects of the process going on within it. If the man
has been living a riotous life in the past and then suddenly turns the
other way about

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

and wishes to become a saint, he cannot do so in the twinkling of an
eye; his various bodies, which as we know are living and knowing
organisms, do not at once submit to the change of front on the part of
their owner. They feel that they ought to have been consulted about the
transaction and they make their grievances known by various pains and
aches and discomforts. These are generally the symptoms accompanying the
process of transmutation. The laboratories of Nature are conducted on
the same principle everywhere. Whether it is the chemist trying to
compound a medicine or the alchemist trying to create a new substance,
they both base their practices upon the eternal and invariable law of
affinity which governs the generation and growth of every thing in the
vast realms of manifest nature. A little reflection will convince us of
this perfect analogy subsisting between nature and man and will help us
so to order our lives as to profit by all the wise provisions which she
has made for the welfare of leer creatures in all the kingdoms.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

When man first turns his eyes heavenward, praying to be lifted up, the
task confronting him is tremendous indeed. The age-long associations of
body, mind and soul have to be severed and new affinities have to be
established. Looking at these things from outside we say one must
exercise "self-control." I wonder whether any one of us realizes the
fullness of the glory of that human being who has really overcome. It
really amounts to the making of a new creature, one ceasing to be a man
and beginning to be a God.

We understand, of course, that the real battle is going on inside the
man. What we see on the surface are only moving hands on the dial of a
clock; the clockwork is inside. The springs of conduct are hidden from
our eyes; the cause of things is beyond our ken. We often believe we
know ourselves and our interests, but the real man and his real needs
pass our comprehension. In his infinite wisdom, the Supreme Lord has
thus ordained it that self-knowledge should come to man by degrees.
While his

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

nature is being transformed, the knowledge of Self filters in. Just look
at the four kinds of yoga taught by the Eastern sages. They were
designed to facilitate this introduction of Self-knowledge into the mind
and the establishment of normal relations between the Divine and
astro-mental parts of man. Raja Yoga was to purify the lower man, Karma
Yoga was to turn his energies into sacrificial work, Gnani Yoga was to
refine his manasic vehicles by mental exercises and study, and at last
Bhakti Yoga was to unite him to God by love and devotion. To most of us
it is not given to tread all the paths at the same time; we are limited
by our congenital failings, and heredity and environment are against us,
so as some of us enter the Path we usually progress along the lines of
least resistance.

If we are of a practical turn of mind we become Karma Yogis, if
students, we become Gnanis, if we are strong-willed we subdue our bodily
and psychic natures and become Raja Yogis, and if our natures are
affectionate and the love element is the

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

strongest then we become Bhaktis. All of these lead to the same goal and
at last merge into one another.

He who strives for liberation must finally master all. Yoga like Alchemy
requires the whole Man; compromise is out of place in these altitudes,
and he, who reserves to himself a little foible or some pet indulgence
and thinks it will be all right in spite of all, will find it very
expensive indeed, because the ladder will give way and the rung he
thought he would skip will prove a pitfall for his feet.

The analogy between Yoga and Alchemy is so perfect and so instructive
that one cannot help admiring that wonderful spiritual guidance from on
high which leas come down to the founders of both these sciences.

You are aware that Yoga comes from the East, while Alchemy comes from
the West. I believe that no great work has ever been accomplished by man
on earth without help from those Spirits of just men made perfect, who
are always around us like clouds of witnesses to render help wherever
needed.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

Now the System of Yoga has been taught for centuries in India and the
practices of Alchemy have been studied for ages in Europe. Both these
schools have had helpers in the higher spheres who inspired their
labors. That the teachings of both agree in their essential principles
is one more proof of their Divine origin. Now the most salient feature
of both Yoga and Alchemy is their agreement as to the vessel in which
the operation is to take place. It is the body of man; by body I do not
mean the physical vehicle only, but the mental body as well. Both have
to be put in the furnace and purged from their old dross until the
glorified spirit is free. "To produce gold one must have gold" is a
Hermetic saying; well, the gold is the spiritual soul within us. It is
she who has to be resurrected from the ashes of Self sense and sin so
that she may enter into her rightful possessions of the Divine Gifts of
virtue, wisdom, and love promised to her by the Giver of all good gifts,
the Father of Lights from whom she comes. "Life itself," says

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Patanjali, "is the
great teacher of Yoga." The cosmic procession of life passing before our
eyes is the High School par excellence in which the children of men
graduate into Yogis of various degrees and rank. Every cycle pushes
humanity a little further upon the high road of evolution, and as one
spiral is passed and another reached, Man finds he has grown almost
imperceptibly in all the graces and accomplishments incidental to the
latest stage of unfoldment.

Those who wish to go ahead of their brethren must not wait for the
generality of men; they must step out of the beaten track and—as it
were—take a hand in their own making. The present moment is very
favorable for this independent departure, because the cyclic law favors
it and the new dispensation into which we are entering makes it easier
of accomplishment. In the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms, the
units undergoing evolution are helplessly subject to the law governing
the group-soul; on the human plane only does independent initiative come
in.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Arrived at this stage the Jiva-Atma or the Spiritual Soul is at liberty
to break loose from the mass and to start on its way back to the source
of its origin. This way of return is through the chamber of ordeals, the
crucible in which transmutation takes place. All metals must be purified
and transformed into gold, which means that all outgoing tendencies must
he mastered, drawn in, and turned upward so that they may serve to
energize the pure Spirit—and help to manifest him according to his
dictates instead of drawing him as hitherto after their own
inclinations.

It is impossible to describe the process in particular as, owing to
Karmic bonds, we all have different burdens to bear, but on the whole it
is safe to say that at any time in our life we are to be found in just
that place and surrounded by just those conditions which, if understood
and respected, would invariably help us to fulfill the law and by so
doing draw nearer to the goal, namely, the liberation of our souls from
the bondage of illusion. But unfortunately we

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

are never quite reconciled to the hard facts of this world and this
life, and even the best of us think we are in the wrong place and if it
were not for this, that, and the other, we might be better off, and have
a better chance to be happy and good. But my dear Brothers and Sisters,
it is not so!

We are, as I said, at every moment of our lives, just where we ought to
be, and happy the man who can realize this truth in all its wonderful
simplicity. The vessel of transmutation into which we have been thrown
will never give us up until we are quite ready and well done; let us not
oppose the process and thus retard the advent of our freedom.

As you are aware, everything in this world is governed by analogy The
law that governs the atom is the same which governs man, and the law
that presides over the evolution of man is identical with the law that
rules the universe. Bearing this in mind, how significant every act of
ours becomes! Often even slight and seemingly unimportant actions of
ours may, in their

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

ramifications, generate karmic results of tremendous importance to our
fellow-men and to the world.

Especially is this true of people of high spiritual status. They are
doubly responsible for their thoughts, words, and deeds, because they
create corresponding effects upon the higher planes.

"To him to whom much is given, of him much shall be required"; that is
to say, the man of power must be alive to it, that with the acquisition
of power he increases his obligations, and the more powerful he grows,
the more sacrificing must he be. When the lower elements of our
constitution become transmuted and refined, we acquire great powers and
many gifts, and the danger arises that we may not adequately appreciate
the solemn duties attaching to them. The law of God can never be broken;
it is we who break ourselves in violating its eternal decrees.

Having overcome most desires, as we finally do, in the process of
transmutation, we must also overcome the greatest of and

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

most subtle of all desires, and that is the desire for power. Power for
its own sake is not worth having, and more than that, it often throws
the disciple far deeper down into the abyss than bodily self-indulgence.
It is the same with spiritual pride—Pride is the sin against the Holy
Ghost, which can never be forgiven. Therefore, when undergoing the
transformation of our natures in the crucible of life, we ought to see
to it that these subtle and poisonous elements are got rid of in the
process.

Let us now recapitulate the main points: As soon as man begins to be
dissatisfied with his old life and his old habits and learns to
appreciate the grave beauties of the higher life, the process of
transmutation is started within his constitution. He may not yet
actually have done anything to begin the new life, but the mere
resolution to do so plants his feet upon the path. Even to see only the
futility of the vain, sinful and empty life, means half the battle won.
When a definite step is taken and the desires truly renounced, the
Karmic effects are mighty

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

and far-reaching. If the aspirant is strong enough to persist in spite
of the trials springing up on every side, as he advances on the Path,
then the work of transmutation enters the second stage, which is the
stage of unification. Before this is reached, all passion, whether
physical or mental, must be rooted out of his nature. Unification is the
crown of the great work; it is the reward of ages of effort and æons of
hard labor. Truly blessed is the man in whom the Divine Self has been
united permanently to the astro-mental part which is all we see of one
another while on earth. When this conjunction has taken place, man has
ceased to be subject to the laws of man; for him, we have been told, "no
law can be framed"; he has ceased to be a child of earth, for he has
become in the truest and deepest sense, a child of God.

Now there is one thought I would like to impress strongly upon our minds
at this point. It is this: while this higher and nobler life is
eminently desirable and all of us would fain attain unto it, we must not

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

forget the grim reality of this every day existence of ours arid, while
reaching out for the higher life, let us not by some careless act or
acts wreck this prosaic foundation upon which the poetical structure of
the life beautiful is to be raised.

Many have made this mistake and destroyed themselves body, mind, and
estate, in order to develop spiritually. What they really did achieve
was entire ruin both physical and spiritual. Let us in our endeavor to
live the higher life be as practical as we are in the management of our
mundane affairs. Above all, let us be guided by reason and let us
discard everything that is cloudy and vague, and after having done all
we possibly can do to guard against the blind forces of the lower nature
and to master all that is beneath us, let us remember that we are
infinitesimal expressions of the one great law, and we can do nothing
better than commend ourselves to its Supreme Author, the great
Law-giver. He knows us better than we know ourselves and He loves us
better too.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

And therefore we say unto this last, "Into Thy hands do we commit our
Spirit and our souls into Thy keeping."
