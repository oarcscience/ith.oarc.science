### WHAT IS THE QABALAH?

The Qabalah is the Secret Doctrine of the Jews, handed down throughout
the ages by the great teachers to their beloved disciples under the
solemn vow of secrecy.

In the Twelfth Century, however, the principal text-book of the Qabalah
was written down by a very learned Rabbi named Moses de Leon. This book
is known as the Zohar, and contains inexhaustible mines of occult
knowledge. Priceless treasures of mystic lore are scattered in its
volumes, awaiting discovery by the intelligent student. The language of
the *Zohar*, however (the Hebrew Chaldaic), known to a very few scholars
only, constitutes the main difficulty in the way of those desirous of
studying the Qabalah.

The learned assemblies of olden times, in which the great Masters of
Israel held forth their doctrines, have been the original sources of the
philosophy of these latter

days. Modern Occultism, too, is derived from the same quarters, and
should the pages of the Holy Qabalah be accessible some day to the
English student, he will be astonished and delighted at the wealth of
occult truth he will find in them.

The books of the Qabalah are fountains of living waters and at a time of
great [spiritual](errata.htm#0.md) need, as the present is, the strength
and consolation offered us through its teachings are doubly welcome.

The greater part of my life has been devoted to this study, and the
teachings given out in my books are all based upon this ancient wisdom
of the Rabbis
