### A QABALISTIC PRAYER

Eternal God, Father of our spirit, enlighten us how to pray rightly unto
thee. We would waste no vain words and we desire no material benefits.
But our hearts yearn and long for the knowledge of Thee, and for Thy
peace. In the fulness of Thy mercies grant us this prayer and fill our
hearts with Thy love to overflowing so that we may not love only those
who love us, but those who do not even know what love is. May we ever be
aware of our humble origin and of our weakness in the days gone by, so
that our hearts may open themselves not only to the strong who give us
joy, but also to the weak ones who give us pain. It is hard for us to do
it, hard indeed but enable us, O Heavenly Father, to sincerely try it
and not to weary in the attempt. The road is steep, and dark is the
night of our journey; our knees do often falter and we cannot as yet
catch a glimpse of our eternal home, but we know that, even in the
obscurity

of the night, Thou art near. Unto Thee, then, we commend ourselves, and
pray Thee to awaken and deepen within us the consciousness of thy
presence so that we may go on our way rejoicing, until that day when our
labors shall be over and we shall awaken in thy likeness.
