### VII.

### JUSTICE AND MERCY

When does one become a Master? When one has learned all the lessons that
earth has to teach. How does one learn all these lessons? By submitting
to all the experiences natural to this sphere without repulsion when
they are painful and without attachment when they seem to be pleasant.
Thus, taking things as they are, and letting them all deliver their
message, the period of schooling is shortened for the disciple, and his
entrance upon the higher stages of the path begins earlier than would
have been the case, had he allowed the various qualities of his
constitution, called Gunas in the East, to play havoc with his desire
nature or to otherwise detain him. There is a saying, "When the disciple
is ready, the Master is ready also." When the disciple is ready means
that he has arrived at a stage when

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

he can listen to that voice which has bee&. called "the Voice of the
Silence," because: we only hear it when we have passed through the
silence and accustomed ourselves to live and move and have our being in
it.

The first four rules of Light on the Path show us how to pass through
the Silence safely. The rule we shall consider tonight is the third.
"Before the voice can speak in the presence of the Master it must have
lost the power to wound." There is a little story of an old Rabbi, a
great teacher of the Qabalah, whose first few words when arising in the
morning were, "Heavenly Father, may I during this day and until I again
close my eyes in sleep not be made the instrument of judgment against
any brother or sister of mine." At first sight it seems as if this is
just a common prayer for help from outside, but it is not. Its
scientific foundation is the same as the one underlying the precepts in
the hall of learning which, as you know, are all truths founded in
Nature. In our earlier days, when we

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

used to pray in the old-fashioned manner. the object of our prayers
appeared to be to make us good, but later on when we learned to know the
true inwardness of things and the purpose of human life, we found that
many a thing which sounded as a religious threat was, in reality, a
statement of fact inherent in the nature of things. Now, when the Master
Hilarion caused to be written down this rule, that "before we can speak
in the presence of the Great Ones our voices must lose their power to
wound," he did not mean to give us a good bit of advice, with a promise
attached to it—that if we are good the Masters will listen to us. No
more did the old Rabbi mean anything of this sort. The idea both had in
mind is the everlasting truth written in the very heart of the cosmic
law. That law determines that on every plane units shall be used for the
improvement of their species. We see this law governing the mineral,
vegetable and animal kingdoms, but it generally escapes our attention
that it also holds good in the human kingdom. Nature in her vast

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

domains uses individuals and entities to further the growth of the
collective bodies of which they are the units. Continual progress is
nature's aim, and, on the human plane, she achieves it by making every
man his brother's keeper. The feeling of repulsion which we experience
at a wrong or careless act of a fellow-man is Nature's safeguard against
the recurrence of a similar act. She put us where we are in order to
eliminate the possibilities of wrong-doing. But now, there are various
ways and means of achieving that end. Punishment is one way and
instruction is another. On the lower mental level, reaction is so quick
and violent that it punishes both the wrong-doer and him who is the
witness of wrong-doing, but, on the higher mental level and on the
planes beyond it, where the spiritual consciousness is wide-awake,
reaction is of a reflective and deliberate character and can select the
mode of its response to any form of discordant action. This principle
was known to the sages and teachers of the past, but the cycle of
evolution did not

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

admit of its universal application. In this century, however, we find it
percolating slowly the social conscience, so that even in state-prisons
it is found to be better policy to make the confinement of prisoners
remedial, rather than vindictive. Now, we as students of the
Wisdom-Religion, realize that there must be an exact correspondence of
these happenings on the outer plane, within the interior regions of our
collective soul life, of which our social structure is but a temporary
and transient expression. We see Nature using us individuals as
instruments to carry out her behests and while so doing refining both
instrument and materials. On the plane on which those we call Masters
work, there is no room for violence or for anything like it. Correction
there is, by means of loving instruction only. Now, as the Theosophical
Society is, so to say, the training-ground for future disciples, those
who watch over it find it necessary from time to time to communicate to
us some of the rules governing life on those exalted planes. "Light on
the Path"

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

is such a communication, and the rule we are now considering is the one
destined to regulate the relations between individuals aspiring to
follow in the footsteps of those Holy Teachers who have learned all
their lessons in past æons of evolution.

Now, apart from the reaction to wrong, which takes actual form by
punishment, there is a finer and subtler mode of reaction known as
criticism or judgment. To have lost the power to wound, our capacity to
criticise and judge must have undergone the same change as the social
custom of punishing crime is gradually undergoing. Our very way of
looking at things must change. To students of Theosophy this should be
easier than to those ignorant of the Ancient Wisdom. We, who know that
the personal life is an illusion and that this whole existence is simply
Maya, created by Nature in order to evolve the true self, should not
find it hard to see that the tendency to wound, whether it be by
thought, or word, or deed, is one of the deceptions practiced upon us by
external nature, prior to the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

awakening of our true selves. It is she who makes us resent wrong and
repel the wrongdoer. Our True Self knows no resentment and is free from
repulsion. In days to come it will be as uncommon to criticise a
spiritual failing as it is today to criticise a physical one. Even at
the present time, well-brought-up children would not laugh at a blind
man, or at a lame one, nor would they make fun of the deaf and dumb; and
yet, does it ever occur to us that, whatever the misbehavior, crime or
vice of a fellowman may be, if it awakens in us any other feeling than
love and pity it is because we are not yet well-brought-up children on
the plane of spirit. When the Sixth Root Race arrives there will
probably be hospitals for criminals and nursing homes for vicious
people, and they will all be treated with the same loving care as we now
treat those who are sick in body. It is to prepare us for this stage
that "Light on the Path" has been given to us. "Before the voice can
speak in the presence of the Masters it must have lost the power to
wound." To realize

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

this rule in its fulness means to be free from the tyranny of Nature,
and, instead of being unconscious instruments in her hands to chastise
and to give pain, we become teachers and helpers and healers, and
exercise mercy instead of judgment.

Every time we are called upon to act, we are faced by our trial, and it
depends upon our attitude whether the doors to further progress shall be
opened to us.

The first of the vestures we have to lay down at the entrance to the
temple is that innate tendency to judge and to criticise, because it is
a loveless proclivity of the old Adam, and within the temple there is no
room for that which is loveless. Therefore the great Masters of the
Inner Wisdom warned us that before our voice can be raised in their
presence it must have lost the power to wound. As long as it wounds, man
cannot teach, neither can he help. Those who wish to become helpers of
the race must not be instruments of judgment, and that is why the old
Rabbi, the teacher of the Kabala, prayed every morning immediately

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

after rising, "Heavenly Father, may I during this day and until I again
close my eyes in sleep, not be made the instrument of judgment against
any brother or sister of mine."
