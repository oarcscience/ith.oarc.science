# CHAPTER IV

### THE ALL

    "Under, and back of, the Universe of Time, Space and Change,  
    is ever to be found The Substantial Reality--the Fundamental  
    Truth."--The Kybalion.

"Substance" means: "that which underlies all outward manifestations; the
essence; the essential reality; the thing in itself," etc. "Substantial"
means: "actually existing; being the essential element; being real,"
etc. "Reality" means: "the state of being real; true, enduring; valid;
fixed; permanent; actual," etc.

Under and behind all outward appearances or manifestations, there must
always be a Substantial Reality. This is the Law. Man considering the
Universe, of which he is a unit, sees nothing but change in matter,
forces, and mental states. He sees that nothing really IS, but that
everything is BECOMING and CHANGING. Nothing stands still-everything is
being born, growing, dying-the very instant a thing reaches its height,
it begins to decline--the law of rhythm is in constant operation--there
is no reality, enduring quality, fixity, or substantiality in anything--
nothing is permanent but Change. He sees all things evolving from other
things, and resolving into other things--constant action and reaction;
inflow and outflow; building up and tearing down; creation and
destruction; birth, growth and death. Nothing endures but Change. And if
he be a thinking man, he realizes that all of these changing things must
be but outward appearances or manifestations of some Underlying
Power--some Substantial Reality.

All thinkers, in all lands and in all times, have assumed the necessity
for postulating the existence of this Substantial Reality. All
philosophies worthy of the name have been based upon this thought. Men
have given to this Substantial Reality many names-some have called it by
the term of Deity (under many titles). Others have called it "The
Infinite and Eternal Energy" others have tried to call it "Matter"--but
all have acknowledged its existence. It is self-evident it needs no
argument.

In these lessons we have followed the example of some of the world's
greatest thinkers, both ancient and modern--the Hermetic. Masters--and
have called this Underlying Power--this Substantial Reality--by the
Hermetic name of "THE ALL," which term we consider the most
comprehensive of the many terms applied by Man to THAT which transcends
names and terms.

We accept and teach the view of the great Hermetic thinkers of all
times, as well as of those illumined souls who have reached higher
planes of being, both of whom assert that the inner nature of THE ALL is
UNKNOWABLE. This must be so, for naught by THE ALL itself can comprehend
its own nature and being.

The Hermetists believe and teach that THE ALL, "in itself," is and must
ever be UNKNOWABLE. They regard all the theories, guesses and
speculations of the theologians and metaphysicians regarding the inner
nature of THE ALL, as but the childish efforts of mortal minds to grasp
the secret of the Infinite. Such efforts have always failed and will
always fail, from the very nature of the task. One pursuing such
inquiries travels around and around in the labyrinth of thought, until
he is lost to all sane reasoning, action or conduct, and is utterly
unfitted for the work of life. He is like the squirrel which frantically
runs around and around the circling treadmill wheel of his cage,
traveling ever and yet reaching nowhere--at the end a prisoner still,
and standing just where he started.

And still more presumptuous are those who attempt to ascribe to THE ALL
the personality, qualities, properties, characteristics and attributes
of themselves, ascribing to THE ALL the human emotions, feelings, and
characteristics, even down to the pettiest qualities of mankind, such as
jealousy, susceptibility to flattery and praise, desire for offerings
and worship, and all the other survivals from the days of the childhood
of the race. Such ideas are not worthy of grown men and women, and are
rapidly being discarded.

(At this point, it may be proper for me to state that we make a
distinction between Religion and Theology--between Philosophy and
Metaphysics. Religion, to us, means that intuitional realization of the
existence of THE ALL, and one's relationship to it; while Theology means
the attempts of men to ascribe personality, qualities, and
characteristics to it; their theories regarding its affairs, will,
desires, plans, and designs, and their assumption of the office of ''
middle-men'' between THE ALL and the people. Philosophy, to us, means
the inquiry after knowledge of things knowable and thinkable; while
Metaphysics means the attempt to carry the inquiry over and beyond the
boundaries and into regions unknowable and unthinkable, and with the
same tendency as that of Theology. And consequently, both Religion and
Philosophy mean to us things having roots in Reality, while Theology and
Metaphysics seem like broken reeds, rooted in the quicksands of
ignorance, and affording naught but the most insecure support for the
mind or soul of Man. we do not insist upon our students accepting these
definitions--we mention them merely to show our position. At any rate,
you shall hear very little about Theology and Metaphysics in these
lessons.)

But while the essential nature of THE ALL is Unknowable, there are
certain truths connected with its existence which the human mind finds
itself compelled to accept. And an examination of these reports form a
proper subject of inquiry, particularly as they agree with the reports
of the Illumined on higher planes. And to this inquiry we now invite
you.

    "THAT which is the Fundamental Truth--the Substantial  
    Reality--is beyond true naming, but the Wise Men call  
    it THE ALL."--The Kybalion.

    "In its Essence, THE ALL is UNKNOWABLE."--The Kybalion.

    "But, the report of Reason must be hospitably received,  
    and treated with respect."--The Kybalion.

The human reason, whose reports we must accept so long as we think at
all, informs us as follows regarding THE ALL, and that without
attempting to remove the veil of the Unknowable:

    (1) THE ALL must be ALL that REALLY IS. There can be  
    nothing existing outside of THE ALL, else THE ALL would  
    not be THE ALL.

    (2) THE ALL must be INFINITE, for there is nothing else  
    to define, confine, bound, limit; or restrict THE ALL.  
    It must be Infinite in Time, or ETERNAL,--it must have  
    always continuously existed, for there is nothing else to  
    have ever created it, and something can never evolve from  
    nothing, and if it had ever "not been," even for a moment,  
    it would not "be" now,--it must continuously exist forever,  
    for there is nothing to destroy it, and it can never  
    "not-be," even for a moment, because something can never  
    become nothing. It must be Infinite in Space--it must be  
    Everywhere, for there is no place outside of THE ALL--it  
    cannot be otherwise than continuous in Space, without break,  
    cessation, separation, or interruption, for there is nothing  
    to break, separate, or interrupt its continuity, and nothing  
    with which to "fill in the gaps." It must be Infinite in  
    Power, or Absolute, for there is nothing to limit, restrict,  
    restrain, confine, disturb or condition it--it is subject to  
    no other Power, for there is no other Power.

    (3) THE ALL must be IMMUTABLE, or not subject to change in  
    its real nature, for there is nothing to work changes upon it  
    nothing into which it could change, nor from which it could  
    have changed. It cannot be added to nor subtracted from;  
    increased nor diminished; nor become greater or lesser in any  
    respect whatsoever. It must have always been, and must always  
    remain, just what it is now--THE ALL--there has never been,  
    is not now, and never will be, anything else into which it  
    can change.

THE ALL being Infinite, Absolute, Eternal and Unchangeable it must
follow that anything finite, changeable, fleeting, and conditioned
cannot be THE ALL. And as there is Nothing outside of THE ALL, in
Reality, then any and all such finite things must be as Nothing in
Reality. Now do not become befogged, nor frightened--we are not trying
to lead you into the Christian Science field under cover of Hermetic
Philosophy. There is a Reconciliation of this apparently contradictory
state of affairs. Be patient, we will reach it in time.

We see around us that which is called "Matter," which forms the physical
foundation for all forms. Is THE ALL merely Matter? Not at all! Matter
cannot manifest Life or Mind, and as Life and Mind are manifested in the
Universe, THE ALL cannot be Matter, for nothing rises higher than its
own source--nothing is ever manifested in an effect that is not in the
cause--nothing is evolved as a consequent that is not involved as an
antecedent. And then Modern Science informs us that there is really no
such thing as Matter--that what we call Matter is merely "interrupted
energy or force," that is, energy or force at a low rate of vibration.
As a recent writer has said "Matter has melted into Mystery." Even
Material Science has abandoned the theory of Matter, and now rests on
the basis of "Energy."

Then is THE ALL mere Energy or Force? Not Energy or Force as the
materialists use the terms, for their energy and force are blind,
mechanical things, devoid of Life or Mind. Life and Mind can never
evolve from blind Energy or Force, for the reason given a moment ago:
"Nothing can rise higher than its source--nothing is evolved unless it
is involved--nothing manifests in the effect, unless it is in the cause.
" And so THE ALL cannot be mere Energy or Force, for, if it were, then
there would be no such things as Life and Mind in existence, and we know
better than that, for we are Alive and using Mind to consider this very
question, and so are those who claim that Energy or Force is Everything.

What is there then higher than Matter or Energy that we know to be
existent in the Universe? LIFE AND MIND! Life and Mind in all their
varying degrees of unfoldment! "Then," you ask, "do you mean to tell us
that THE ALL is LIFE and MIND?" Yes! and No! is our answer. If you mean
Life and Mind as we poor petty mortals know them, we say No! THE ALL is
not that! "But what kind of Life and Mind do you mean?" you ask.

The answer is "LIVING MIND," as far above that which mortals know by
those words, as Life and Mind are higher than mechanical forces, or
matter--INFINITE LIVING MIND as compared to finite "Life and Mind." We
mean that which the illumined souls mean when they reverently pronounce
the word: "SPIRIT!"

"THE ALL" is Infinite Living Mind--the Illumined call it SPIRIT!
