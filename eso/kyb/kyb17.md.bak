# CHAPTER XV

### HERMETIC AXIOMS

    "The possession of Knowledge, unless accompanied by a  
    manifestation and expression in Action, is like the  
    hoarding of precious metals-a vain and foolish thing.  
    Knowledge, like wealth, is intended for Use. The Law of  
    Use is Universal, and he who violates it suffers by  
    reason of his conflict with natural forces."--The Kybalion.

The Hermetic Teachings, while always having been kept securely locked up
in the minds of the fortunate possessors thereof, for reasons which we
have already stated, were never intended to be merely stored away and
secreted. The Law of Use is dwelt upon in the Teachings, as you may see
by reference to the above quotation from The Kybalion, which states it
forcibly. Knowledge without Use and Expression is a vain thing, bringing
no good to its possessor, or to the race. Beware of Mental Miserliness,
and express into Action that which you have learned. Study the Axioms
and Aphorisms, but practice them also.

We give below some of the more important Hermetic Axioms, from The
Kybalion, with a few comments added to each. Make these your own, and
practice and use them, for they are not really your own until you have
Used them.

    "To change your mood or mental state--change your  
    vibration."--The Kybalion.

One may change his mental vibrations by an effort of Will, in the
direction of deliberately fixing the Attention upon a more desirable
state. Will directs the Attention, and Attention changes the Vibration.
Cultivate the Art of Attention, by means of the Will, and you have
solved the secret of the Mastery of Moods and Mental States.

    "To destroy an undesirable rate of mental vibration,  
    put into operation the principle of Polarity and  
    concentrate upon the opposite pole to that which  
    you desire to suppress. Kill out the undesirable by  
    changing its polarity."--The Kybalion.

This is one of the most important of the Hermetic Formulas. It is based
upon true scientific principles. We have shown you that a mental state
and its opposite were merely the two poles of one thing, and that by
Mental Transmutation the polarity might be reversed. This Principle is
known to modern psychologists, who apply it to the breaking up of
undesirable habits by bidding their students concentrate upon the
opposite quality. If you are possessed of Fear, do not waste time trying
to "kill out" Fear, but instead cultivate the quality of Courage, and
the Fear will disappear. Some writers have expressed this idea most
forcibly by using the illustration of the dark room. You do not have to
shovel out or sweep out the Darkness, but by merely opening the shutters
and letting in the Light the Darkness has disappeared. To kill out a
Negative quality, concentrate upon the Positive Pole of that same
quality, and the vibrations will gradually change from Negative to
Positive, until finally you will become polarized on the Positive pole
instead of the Negative. The reverse is also true, as many have found
out to their sorrow, when they have allowed themselves to vibrate too
constantly on the Negative pole of things. By changing your polarity you
may master your moods, change your mental states, remake your
disposition, and build up character. Much of the Mental Mastery of the
advanced Hermetics is due to this application of Polarity, which is one
of the important aspects of Mental Transmutation. Remember the Hermetic
Axiom (quoted previously), which says:

    "Mind (as well as metals and elements) may be transmuted  
    from state to state; degree to degree, condition to  
    condition; pole to pole; vibration to vibration."--The Kybalion.

The mastery of Polarization is the mastery of the fundamental principles
of Mental Transmutation or Mental Alchemy, for unless one acquires the
art of changing his own polarity, he will be unable to affect his
environment. An understanding of this principle will enable one to
change his own Polarity, as well as that of others, if he will but
devote the time, care, study and practice necessary to master the art.
The principle is true, but the results obtained depend upon the
persistent patience and practice of the student.

    "Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the Art  
    of Polarization."--The Kybalion.

As we have explained in previous chapters, the Hermetists hold that the
Principle of Rhythm manifests on the Mental Plane as well as on the
Physical Plane, and that the bewildering succession of moods, feelings,
emotions, and other mental states, are due to the backward and forward
swing of the mental pendulum, which carries us from one extreme of
feeling to the other. The Hermetists also teach that the Law of
Neutralization enables one, to a great extent, to overcome the operation
of Rhythm in consciousness. As we have explained, there is a Higher
Plane of Consciousness, as well as the ordinary Lower Plane, and the
Master by rising mentally to the Higher Plane causes the swing of the
mental pendulum to manifest on the Lower Plane, and he, dwelling on his
Higher Plane, escapes the consciousness of the swing backward. This is
effected by polarizing on the Higher Self, and thus raising the mental
vibrations of the Ego above those of the ordinary plane of
consciousness. It is akin to rising above a thing and allowing it to
pass beneath you. The advanced Hermetist polarizes himself at the
Positive Pole of his Being-the "I Am" pole rather than the pole of
personality and by "refusing" and "denying" the operation of Rhythm,
raises himself above its plane of consciousness, and standing firm in
his Statement of Being he allows the pendulum to swing back on the Lower
Plane without changing his Polarity. This is accomplished by all
individuals who have attained any degree of self-mastery, whether they
understand the law or not. Such persons simply "refuse" to allow
themselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by
steadfastly affirming the superiority they remain polarized on the
Positive pole. The Master, of course, attains a far greater degree of
proficiency, because he understands the law which he is overcoming by a
higher law, and by the use of his Will he attains a degree of Poise and
Mental Steadfastness almost impossible of belief on the part of those
who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by the mental
pendulum of moods and feelings.

Remember always, however, that you do not really destroy the Principle
of Rhythm, for that is indestructible. You simply overcome one law by
counter-balancing it with another and thus maintain an equilibrium. The
laws of balance and counter-balance are in operation on the mental as
well as on the physical planes, and an understanding of these laws
enables one to seem to overthrow laws, whereas he is merely exerting a
counterbalance.

    "Nothing escapes the Principle of Cause and Effect,  
    but there are many Planes of Causation, and one may use  
    the laws of the higher to overcome the laws of the  
    lower."--The Kybalion.

By an understanding of the practice of Polarization, the Hermetists rise
to a higher plane of Causation and thus counter-balance the laws of the
lower planes of Causation. By rising above the plane of ordinary Causes
they become themselves, in a degree, Causes instead of being merely
Caused. By being able to master their own moods and feelings, and by
being able to neutralize Rhythm, as we have already explained, they are
able to escape a great part of the operations of Cause and Effect on the
ordinary plane. The masses of people are carried along, obedient to
their environment; the wills and desires of others stronger than
themselves; the effects of inherited tendencies; the suggestions of
those about them; and other outward causes; which tend to move them
about on the chess-board of life like mere pawns. By rising above these
influencing causes, the advanced Hermetists seek a higher plane of
mental action, and by dominating their moods, emotions, impulses and
feelings, they create for themselves new characters, qualities and
powers, by which they overcome their ordinary environment, and thus
become practically players instead of mere Pawns. Such people help to
play the game of life understandingly, instead of being moved about this
way and that way by stronger influences and powers and wills. They use
the Principle of Cause and Effect, instead of being used by it. Of
course, even the highest are subject to the Principle as it manifests on
the higher planes, but on the lower planes of activity, they are Masters
instead of Slaves. As The Kybalion says:

    "The wise ones serve on the higher, but rule on the lower.  
    They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their  
    own plane, and those below them they rule and give orders.  
    And, yet, in so doing, they form a part of the Principle,  
    instead of opposing it. The wise man falls in with the Law,  
    and by understanding its movements he operates it instead  
    of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer  
    turn this way and that way, going and coming as he will,  
    instead of being as the log which is carried here and  
    there--so is the wise man as compared to the ordinary  
    man--and yet both swimmer and log; wise man and fool,  
    are subject to Law. He who understands this is well on  
    the road to Mastery."--The Kybalion.

In conclusion let us again call your attention to the Hermetic Axiom:

    "True Hermetic Transmutation is a Mental Art."--The Kybalion.

In the above axiom, the Hermetists teach that the great work of
influencing one's environment is accomplished by Mental Power. The
Universe being wholly mental, it follows that it may be ruled only by
Mentality. And in this truth is to be found an explanation of all the
phenomena and manifestations of the various mental powers which are
attracting so much attention and study in these earlier years of the
Twentieth Century. Back of and under the teachings of the various cults
and schools, remains ever constant the Principle of the Mental Substance
of the Universe. If the Universe be Mental in its substantial nature,
then it follows that Mental Transmutation must change the conditions and
phenomena of the Universe. If the Universe is Mental, then Mind must be
the highest power affecting its phenomena. If this be understood then
all the so-called "miracles" and "wonder-workings" are seen plainly for
what they are.

    "THE ALL is MIND; The Universe is Mental."--The Kybalion.
