HAVING established the *principle* of the possible unification of the
forms of our knowledge, let us discover if this unification is not
somewhere realized; how it may be realized; and whether it will be
realized *in a form entirely new*, or in one of the existing forms which
shall include all others in itself.

For this we shall return to the fundamental principles of our knowledge,
and compare the possible chances for the development of different paths,
i.e., we shall try to find out as best we may that path which leads to
the new knowledge, and in the shortest time.

Up to a certain point we have already established this regarding the
*emotional path*; the growth of the emotions, their purification and
their liberation from the materialistic elements of *possession and fear
of loss* must lead to super-personal knowledge and to intuition.

But how can the intellectual path lead to the new forms of knowledge?

First of all, what is the new knowledge?

The new knowledge is *direct knowledge*, by an inner sense. I feel my
own pain directly; the new knowledge can give me the power to *sense*,
as mine, the pain of another man. Thus the new knowledge is the
expansion of a direct experience. The question is, can the expansion of
objective knowledge be founded upon this

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

new experience? Let us analyze the nature of objective knowledge.

Our objective knowledge is contained in science and philosophy. *Inner
experience* science has always regarded as *a thing given*, which cannot
be changed, but as something "doubtful," standing in need of
verification and affirmation by the objective method. Science has
studied the world as an objective phenomenon, and it has striven to
study the psyche and its properties as such another objective
phenomenon.

In another quarter, the study of the psyche from the inside, so to
speak, was proceeding simultaneously with this, but to this study no
great significance was ever attached. The limits of inner knowledge,
i.e., the limits of the psyche, were considered to be strictly definite,
established, and unchangeable. Only for objective knowledge, founded
upon identical inner experience, was the possibility of expansion
admitted.

Let us discover if there is not some mistake here: is the expansion of
objective knowledge, founded upon a limited experience, really possible,
and are the possibilities of experience really limited?

\_\_\_\_\_

Developing science, i.e., objective knowledge, is encountering obstacles
everywhere. Science studies phenomena; just as soon as it attempts to
discover *causes*, it is confronted with the wall of the unknown, and
*to it* unknowable. The question narrows itself down to this: is this
unknowable absolutely unknowable, or is it so only for the methods of
our science?

At the present time the situation is just this: the number of unknown
facts in every region of scientific knowledge is rapidly increasing; and
the unknown threatens to swallow the known—or the accepted as known. One
might define the progress of science, especially latterly, as a very
rapid growth of *the regions of nescience*.

Nescience of course existed before, and not in less degree than at
present. But before, it was not so clearly recognized—at that time
science did not know *what it does not know*. Now it knows this more and
more, and more and more knows its *conditionality*. A little more, and
in every separate branch of science that which it does not know will
become greater than *that which it knows*.

In every department science itself is beginning to repudiate its

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

own foundations. A little more, and science in its entirety will ask,
"Where am I?"

Positive thinking—which conceived of its problem as the deducing of
general conclusions from the findings of each separate science and all
of them combined—will feel itself compelled to deduce conclusions from
that which science does not know. Then all the world will see before it
the colossus with feet of clay, or rather without any feet at all, but
with a formidable misty body, hanging in the air.

For a long time philosophy has realized the lack of feet of this
colossus, but the majority of cultivated mankind is still hypnotized by
positivism, which sees something in place of those feet. How-ever, it
will be necessary to part company with this illusion very soon.
Mathematics, lying at the very foundation of positive knowledge, and to
which exact science always pointed with pride, as to its subject and
vassal, is in reality now denying all positivism. Mathematics was
included in the cycle of positive sciences only by mistake, and soon
indeed mathematics will become the principal weapon AGAINST POSITIVISM.

By positivism I mean, in this connection, that system which affirms, in
contradiction to Kant, that the study of phenomena *can* bring us nearer
to things in themselves, i.e., which affirms that by going along the
path of the study of phenomena we can come to an understanding of
causes, and—this is important—which regards physico-mechanical phenomena
as the cause of biological and psychic phenomena.

The usual positivistic view denies the existence of *the hidden side of
life*, i.e., it finds that the hidden side consists of electro-magnetic
phenomena and opens to us only little by little—and that the progress of
science consists in the gradual unveiling of the hidden.

"This is not known as yet," says the positivist, when his attention is
called to something 'hidden,' "*but it will be known*. Science, going by
the same path that it has gone up to now, will discover this also. Five
hundred years ago, Europe did not know of the existence of America;
seventy years ago we did not know of the existence of bacteria;
twenty-five years ago we did not know of the existence of radium. But
America, bacteria and radium are all discovered now. Similarly and by
the same methods, and by such methods only, will be discovered
everything that is to be discovered.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The apparatuses
are being perfected, the methods, processes and observations are being
refined. That which we did not even suspect a hundred years ago, has now
become a generally known and generally understood fact. Everything that
is possible to be known will become known after this manner."

Thus do the adherents of the positivistic viewpoints speak, but at the
foundation of these reasonings lies a deep delusion.

The affirmation of positivism would be quite true did positivism move
uniformly in all directions of the unknown; if sealed doors did not
exist for it; if in the multitude of questions the *principal* questions
did not remain just as obscure as in those times when science did not
exist at all. We see that enormous regions are closed utterly to
science, that it *never* penetrated into them, and worst of all it made
*not a single step* in the direction of these regions.

There are multitudes of problems the solving of which science *has not
even attempted*; problems in the presence of which the contemporary
scientist, armed with all his science, is as helpless as a savage or a
four-year-old child.

Such are the problems of life and death, the problems of space and time,
the mystery of consciousness, etc., etc.

We all know this, and the only thing we can do is to try *not to think*
about the existence of these problems, to forget about them. We do so as
a rule, but this does not annihilate them. They continue to exist, and
at any given moment we may turn to them and try on them the rigidity and
force of our *scientific method*. And every time, at such an attempt, we
find that our scientific method is not equal to these problems. By its
aid we can discover the chemical composition of remote stars; can
photograph the skeleton within the human body, invisible to the human
eye; can invent a floating mine which can be controlled from a distance
by means of electrical waves, and can in this way annihilate in a moment
hundreds of lives; but by the aid of this method we cannot tell what the
man standing beside us is thinking about. No matter how much we may
weigh, sound or photograph a man, we shall *never* know his thoughts
*unless he himself tells them to us*. BUT THIS IS TRULY QUITE A
DIFFERENT METHOD.

The sphere of action of the method of exact science is strictly

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

limited. This sphere is the world of the immediate experience accessible
for man. In the world lying beyond the domain of usual experience exact
science with its methods has *never* penetrated and *will never
penetrate*.

The expansion of objective knowledge is possible only in case direct
experience is expanded. But in spite of all the growth of objective
knowledge science has made not one step in this direction and the
border-line of experience remains *in the same place*. Could science
take a single step in this direction, were we able to feel or sense
differently, then we might admit that science might move and take two,
three, ten, and ten thousand steps. But it has taken *not even one*, and
it is therefore reasonable to believe that it will never take it. The
world outside the experience of the five senses is closed to objective
investigation, and for this quite definite causes exist.

By no means everything that exists can be detected by any of five
senses.

Objective existence is a very narrowly defined form of existence, and
does not by any means exhaust or comprehend existence as a whole. The
mistake of positivism consists in the fact that it has recognized as
really existing only that which exists objectively, and it has even
begun to deny *the very existence* of all the rest.

But what is objectivity?

We can define it in this way: because of the properties of *our*
receptivity, or because of *the conditions* under which our psyche
works, we segregate *a small number of facts* into a definite group.
This group of facts represents in itself the objective world, and is
accessible to the investigation of science. But in no case does this
group represent in itself EVERYTHING THAT IS EXISTING. Extension in
space and existence in time constitute the first condition of objective
existence. And yet the forms of the extension of a thing in space, and
those of its existence in time are created by the cognizing subject, and
do not belong to the thing itself. Matter is first of all
*three-dimensional*. This three-dimensionality is the form of our
receptivity. Matter of four dimensions would imply a change in the form
of our receptivity.

Materiality is the condition of existence in space and time, i.e., a
condition of existence under which "at one time, and in one place, *two
similar* phenomena cannot occur." This is an exhaustive definition

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

of materiality. It is clear that under the conditions known to us, two
similar phenomena, occurring simultaneously in one place, will compose
one phenomenon. But this is obligatory for those conditions of existence
which we know, i.e., for such matter as we perceive. For the universe it
is absolutely not obligatory. We constantly observe the conditions of
materiality in those cases in which we must create in our life *a
sequence* of phenomena or are obliged to *select*, because our matter
does not permit us to juxtapose in a definite interval of time more than
a certain number of phenomena. The necessity for *selection* is perhaps
the chief *visible* sign of materiality. Outside of matter, the
necessity for. selection is done away with, and if we imagine the life
of a feeling being, independent of the conditions of materiality, such a
being will be capable of possessing simultaneously such faculties as
from our standpoint are incompatible, opposite, and eliminative of one
another: the power of being in several places at the same time; to
command different views; to perform opposite and mutually exclusive
actions simultaneously.

In speaking of matter it is necessary always to remember that matter is
not a substance, but a condition. Suppose for example, that a man is
blind. It is impossible to regard this blindness as a substance; it is a
condition of the existence of a given man. Matter is some sort of
blindness.

Objective knowledge can grow infinitely, its progress depending on the
perfection of its instruments and the refinement of its methods of
observation and experiment. One thing only it cannot transcend—the
limits of the three-dimensional sphere, i.e., the conditions of space
and time, for the reason that objective knowledge is created under these
conditions, and the conditions of the existence of the three-dimensional
world are the conditions of its existence. Objective knowledge will
always be subject to these conditions, for otherwise it would cease to
exist. No apparatus, no instrument, will ever conquer these conditions,
for should they conquer they would destroy themselves first of all.
*Perpetual motion*, i.e., the violation of the fundamental laws of the
three-dimensional world as we know it, would be the only victory over
the three-dimensional world *in the three-dimensional world itself*.

But it is necessary to remember that objective knowledge does not study
facts, but *only the perception of facts*.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

IN ORDER THAT OBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE SHALL TRANSCEND THE LIMITS OF THE
THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPHERE, IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE CONDITIONS OF
PERCEPTION SHALL CHANGE.

As long as this does not happen, our objective knowledge is confined
within the limits of *an infinite three-dimensional sphere*. It can
proceed infinitely upon the radii of that sphere, but it will never
penetrate into that region *a section of which* constitutes our
three-dimensional world. Moreover we know, from the preceding, that
should our receptivity become more limited, then objective knowledge
would be correspondingly limited also. It is impossible to convey to a
dog the idea of the sphericality of the earth; to make it remember the
weight of the sun and the distances between the planets is equally
impossible. Its objective knowledge is vastly more *personal* than ours;
and the cause of it lies in the dog's more limited psyche.

Thus we see that objective knowledge depends upon the properties of the
psyche.

Indeed, between the objective knowledge of a savage and that of Herbert
Spencer there is an enormous difference; but that of neither the one nor
the other transcends the limit of the three-dimensional sphere, i.e.,
the limits of the "conditional," the unreal. In order to transcend the
three-dimensional sphere it is necessary to expand or change the forms
of receptivity.

Is the expansion of the limits of receptivity possible?

The study of complex forms of consciousness assures us that it is
possible.

Plotinus, the famous Alexandrian philosopher (third century) affirmed
that for perfect knowledge the subject and object must be united that
the rational agent and the thing being comprehended must not be
separate.

<span class="small">For that which *sees* is itself the thing, which IS
SEEN. \[*Select Works of Plotinus*. Bohn's Library, p. 271.\]</span>

Here it is indeed necessary to understand, "to see" other than in a
literal sense. The "seeing" changes with the changes of the state of
consciousness in which it is proceeding.

But what forms of consciousness exist?

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Hindu philosophy makes the division into four states of consciousness:
sleep, dream, waking, and the state of absolute
consciousness—*turiya*. <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) (*The
Ancient Wisdom*, Annie Besant.)

G. R. S. Mead, in the preface to Taylor's translation of Plotinus
(*Bohn's Library*) correlates the terminology of Shankarâchârya—the
leader of the *Advaita-Vedânta* school of ancient India—with that of
Plotinus.

<span class="small">The first or spiritual state was ecstasy; from
ecstasy it forgot itself into deep sleep; from profound sleep it awoke
out of unconsciousness, but still within itself, into the internal world
of dreams; from dreaming it passes finally into the thoroughly waking
state, and the outer world of sense.</span>

Ecstasy is the term used by Plotinus; it is entirely identical with the
term *turiya* of Hindu psychology.

The consciousness, which is in a waking condition, is surrounded by what
constitutes its sense-organs and receptive apparatus in the phenomenal
world; it differentiates the "subjective" from the "objective," and
differentiates its forms of perception from "reality." It recognizes the
phenomenal objective world as reality, and dreams as unreality, and
includes along with it, as being unreal, the entire subjective world.
Its vague sensation of real things, lying beyond that which is
apprehended by the organs of sense, i.e., sensations of noumena,
consciousness identifies as it were with dreams—with the unreal,
imaginary, abstract, subjective—and regards *phenomena* as the only
reality.

Gradually convinced by reason of the unreality of phenomena, or inwardly
sensing this unreality and the reality which lies behind, we free
ourselves from the mirage of phenomena, we begin to understand that all
the phenomenal world is in substance subjective also, that the great
realities lie deeper down. Then a complete change takes place in
consciousness in all its concepts *about reality*. That

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

which before was regarded as real becomes unreal, and that which was
regarded as unreal becomes real. <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)

This transition into the absolute state of consciousness is "UNION WITH
DIVINITY," "VISION OF GOD," EXPERIENCING THE "KINGDOM OF HEAVEN,"
"ENTERING NIRVANA." All these expressions of mystical religions
represent the psychological fact of the expansion of consciousness, such
an expansion that the consciousness absorbs [itself](errata.htm#39.md) in
the all.

C. W. Leadbeater, in an essay, *Some Notes on the Higher Planes*.
*Nirvana* (*The Theosophist*. July, 1910.) writes:

Sir Edwin Arnold wrote of that beatific condition, that "the dewdrop
slips into the shining sea."

Those who have passed through that most marvelous of experiences know
that, paradoxical as it may seem, the sensation is exactly the reverse,
and that a far closer description would be that THE OCEAN HAD SOMEHOW
BEEN POURED INTO THE DROP!

The consciousness, wide as the sea, with "its centre everywhere and its
circumference nowhere," is a great and glorious fact; but when a man
attains it, it seems to him that his consciousness has widened to take
in all that, not that he is merged into something else.

This pouring of the ocean into the drop occurs because the consciousness
never loses itself, i.e., does not disappear, does not become
extinguished. When it seems to us that consciousness is extinguished, in
reality it is only changing its form, it ceases to be analogical to
ours, and we lose the means of convincing ourselves of its existence.

We have no exact data at all to think that it is dissipated. In order to
escape from the field possible to our observation, it is sufficient for
consciousness TO CHANGE ONLY A LITTLE.

In the objective world, indeed, this "slipping of the dewdrop into the
sea" leads to the annihilation of the drop, to the absorption of it by
the sea. We have never observed another order of things in the objective
world and therefore cannot imagine it. But in the *real*, i.e., the
subjective world, of course another order must exist and operate. The
DROP OF CONSCIOUSNESS merging with the SEA

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

OF CONSCIOUSNESS *knows it, but does not itself cease to exist because
of that*. Therefore undoubtedly, the sea is absorbed by the drop.

In the *Letters to Flaccus* of Plotinus, we find a wonderful description
of a psychology and theory of knowledge founded exactly upon the idea of
the expansion of receptivity.

External objects present us only with appearances. Concerning them,
therefore, we may be said to possess opinion rather than knowledge. The
distinctions in the actual world of appearance are of import only to
ordinary and practical men. Our question lies with the ideal reality
that exists behind appearance. How does the mind perceive these ideas?
Are they without us, and is the reason, like sensation, occupied with
objects external to itself? What certainty would we then have—what
assurance that our perception was infallible? The object perceived would
be a something different from the mind perceiving it. We should have
then an image instead of reality. It would be monstrous to believe for a
moment that the mind was unable to perceive ideal truth as it is, and
that we had not certainty and real knowledge concerning the world of
intelligence. It follows, therefore, that this region of truth is not to
be investigated as a thing external to us, and so only imperfectly
known. It is within us. Here the objects we contemplate and that which
contemplates are identical—both are thought. The subject cannot surely
know an object different from itself. The world of ideas lies within our
intelligence. Truth, therefore, is not the agreement of our apprehension
of an external object with the object itself. It is the agreement of the
mind with itself. Consciousness, therefore, is the sole basis of
certainty. The mind is its own witness. Reason sees in itself that which
is above itself and its source; and again, that which is below itself as
still itself once more.

Knowledge has three degrees—opinion, science, illumination. The means or
instrument of the first is sense; of the second dialectic; of the third
intuition. To the last I subordinate reason. It is absolute knowledge
founded on the identity of the mind knowing with the object known.

There is a raying out of all orders of existence, an external emanation
from the ineffable One. There is again a returning impulse, drawing all
upward and inward toward the centre from whence all came. . . . The wise
man recognizes the idea of the good within him. This he develops by
withdrawal into the holy place of his own soul. He who does not
understand how the soul contains the beautiful within itself, seeks to
realize beauty without by laborious production. His aim should rather be
to concentrate and simplify, and so to expand his being; instead of
going out into the manifold, to forsake it for the One, and to float
upwards

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

toward the divine fount of being whose stream flows within him.

You ask, how can we know the Infinite? I, answer, not by reason. It is
the office of reason to distinguish and define. The infinite, therefore,
cannot be ranked among its objects. You can only apprehend the infinite
by a faculty superior to reason, by entering into a state in which you
are your finite self no longer—in which the divine essence is
communicated to you. This is ecstasy. It is the liberation of your mind
from its finite consciousness. Like can only apprehend like; when you
thus cease to be finite, you become one with the infinite. In the
reduction of your soul to its simplest self, its divine essence, you
realize this union—this identity.

But this sublime condition is not of permanent duration. It is only now
and then that we can enjoy this elevation above the limits of the body
and the world. I myself have realized it but three times as yet, and
Porphyry hitherto not once.

All that tends to purify and elevate the mind will assist you in this
attainment, and facilitate the approach and the recurrence of these
happy intervals. There are, then, different roads by which this end may
be reached. The love of beauty which exalts the poet; that devotion to
the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the
philosopher, and that love and those prayers by which some devout and
ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection—these are the
great highways conducting to the height above the actual and the
particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite,
who shines out as from the depths of the soul.

In another place in his works, Plotinus defines the ecstatic knowledge
more exactly, presenting such properties of it as to reveal to us quite
clearly that the infinite expansion of *subjective knowledge* is there
meant.

<span class="small">When we see God \[says Plotinus\] we see him not by
reason, but by something that is higher than reason. It is impossible
however to say about him who sees that he sees, because he does not
behold and discern *two different things* (the seer and the thing seen).
He changes completely, ceases to be himself, preserves nothing of his I.
Immersed in God, he constitutes one whole with Him; like the centre of a
circle, which coincides with the centre of another circle.</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[239:1](to22.htm#fr_30.md) According to the
interpretation of the Southern Hindu school of occultism, the four
states of consciousness are understood in somewhat different order. The
most remote from the True, the most illusory, is the waking state; the
second—sleep—is already nearer to the True; the third—*deep sleep*
without dreams—contact with the True; and the fourth, *sâmâdhi*, or
ecstasy—union with the True.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[240:1](to22.htm#fr_31.md) The conceptions of the
subjective and of the objective should undergo a change. The usual
terminology will be incorrect for an exact understanding. Everything
phenomenal will become subjective; and the truly objective will be that
which under ordinary conditions is regarded as subjective or
non-existent.
