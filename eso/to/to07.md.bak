WE have established by a comparison of the relation of lower dimensional
figures to higher dimensional ones that it is possible to regard a
four-dimensional body as the tracing of the motion of a
three-dimensional body upon the dimension not contained in it; i.e.,
that the direction of the motion upon the fourth dimension lies outside
of all the directions which are possible in three-dimensional space.

But in what direction is it?

In order to answer this question it will be necessary to discover
whether we do not know some motion not confined in three-dimensional
space.

We know that every motion in space is accompanied by that which we call
*motion in time*. [Moreover](errata.htm#8.md), we know that everything
existing, even if not moving in space, moves eternally in time.

And equally in all cases, whether speaking of motion or absence of
motion, we have in mind an idea of what was before, what now becomes,
and what will follow after. In other words, we have in mind the idea of
time. The idea of motion of any kind, also the idea of absence of
motion, is indissolubly bound up with the idea of time. Any motion or
absence of motion proceeds in time and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

cannot proceed out of time. Consequently, before speaking of what motion
is, we must answer the question, what is time?

Time is the most formidable and difficult problem which confronts
humanity.

Kant regards time as he does space: as a subjective form of our
receptivity; i.e., he says that we *create time* ourselves, as a
function of our receptive apparatus, for convenience in perceiving the
outside world. Reality is continuous and constant, but in order to make
possible the perception of it, we must dissever it into separate
moments; imagine it as an infinite series of separate moments out of
which there exists for us only one. In other words, we perceive reality
as if through a narrow slit, and what we *are seeing* through this slit
we call the present; what we did see and now do not see—the past; and
what we do not quite see but are expecting—the future.

Regarding each phenomenon as an *effect* of another, or others, and this
in its turn as a cause of a third; that is, regarding all phenomena in
functional interdependence one upon another, by this very act we are
contemplating them in time, because we picture to ourselves quite
clearly and precisely first a cause, then an effect; first an action,
then its function; and cannot contemplate them otherwise. Thus we may
say that the idea of time is bound up with the idea of causation and
functional interdependence. Without time, causation cannot exist, just
as without time, motion or the absence of motion cannot exist.

But our perception concerning our "being in time" is entangled and misty
up to improbability.

First of all let us analyze our relation toward the past, present and
future. *Usually we think that the past already does not exist*. It has
passed, disappeared, altered, transformed itself into something else.
The future also does not exist—it does not exist as yet. It has not
arrived, has not formed. By the present we mean the moment of transition
of the future into the past, i.e., *the moment of transition of a
phenomenon from one non-existence into another non-existence*. For that
moment only does the phenomenon exist for us in reality; before, it
existed in potentiality, afterward it will exist in remembrance. But
this short moment is after all only a fiction: it has no measurement. We
have a full right to say that

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

the present does not exist. We can never catch it. That which we did
catch is *always the past*!

If we are to stop at that we must admit that the world does not exist,
or exists only in some phantasmagoria of illusions, flashing and
disappearing.

Usually we take no account of this, and do not reflect that our
customary view of time leads to utter absurdity.

Let us imagine a stupid traveller going from one city to another and
half way between these two cities. A stupid traveller thinks that the
city from which he has departed last week does not exist *now*: only the
memory of it is left; the walls are ruined, the towers fallen, the
inhabitants have either died or gone away. Also, that city at which he
is destined to arrive in several days does not exist now either, but is
being hurriedly built for his arrival, and on the day of that arrival
will be ready, populated, and set in order, and on the day after his
departure will be destroyed just as was the first one.

We are thinking of things in time exactly in this way—everything passes
away, nothing returns! The spring has passed, it does not exist *still*.
The autumn has not come, it does not exist *as yet*.

But what does exist?

The present.

But *the present* is not a seizable moment, it is continuously
transitory into the past.

So, strictly speaking, neither the past, nor the present, nor the future
exists for us. *Nothing exists!* And yet we are living, feeling,
thinking—and something surrounds us. Consequently, in our usual attitude
toward time there exists some mistake. This error we shall endeavor to
detect.

We accepted at the very beginning that *something* exists. We called
that something the world. How then can the world exist if it is not
existing in the past, in the present and in the future?

That conception of the world which we deduced from our usual view of
time makes the world appear like a continuously gushing out igneous
fountain of fireworks, each spark of which flashes for a moment and
disappears, *never* to appear any more. Flashes are going on
continuously, following one after another, there are an

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

infinite number of sparks, and everything together produces the
impression of a flame, *though it does not exist in reality*.

The autumn has not yet come. *It will be, but it does not exist now*.
And we give no thought to how that can *appear* which is *not*.

We are moving upon a plane, and recognize as really existing only the
small circle lighted by our consciousness. Everything out of this
circle, which we do not see, we negate; we do not like to admit that it
exists. We are moving upon the plane in one direction. This direction we
consider as eternal and infinite. But the direction *at right angles* to
it, those lines which we are intersecting, we do not like to recognize
as eternal and infinite. We imagine them as going into non-existence at
once, as soon as we, have passed them, and that the lines before us have
not as yet risen out of non-existence. If, presupposing that we are
moving upon a sphere, upon its equator or one of its parallels, then it
will appear that we recognize as really existing *only one* meridian:
those which are behind us have disappeared and those ahead of us have
not appeared as yet. .

We are going forward like a blind man, who feels paving stones and
lanterns and walls of houses with his stick and *believes* in the real
existence of only that which he touches *now*, which he feels *now*.
That which has passed has disappeared and will never return! That which
has not as yet been does not exist. The blind man remembers the route
which he has traversed; he expects that ahead the way will continue, but
he sees neither forward nor backward *because he does not see anything*;
because his instrument of knowledge—the stick—has a definite, and not
very great length, and beyond the reach of his stick non-existence
begins.

Wundt, in one of his books, called attention to the fact that our
vaunted five organs of sense are in reality just *feelers* by which we
feel the world around us. We live groping about. *We never see
anything*. We are always just feeling everything. With the help of the
microscope and the telescope, the telegraph and the telephone, we are
extending our feelers a little, so to speak, but we are not beginning
*to see*. To say that we *are seeing* would be possible only in case we
could know the past and the future. But we do not see, and because of
this we can never assure ourselves of that which we cannot *feel*.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

This is the reason why we count as really existing only that circle
which our feelers grasp at a given moment. Beyond that—darkness and
non-existence.

But have we any right *to think* in this way?

Let us imagine a consciousness that is not bound by the conditions of
sensuous receptivity. Such a consciousness can rise above the plane upon
which we are moving; it can see far beyond the limits of the circle
enlightened by our usual consciousness; it can see that not only does
the line upon which we are moving exist, but also all lines
perpendicular to it which we are intersecting, which we have ever
intersected, and which we shall intersect. After rising above the plane
this consciousness can see the plane, can convince itself that it is
really a plane, and not a single line. Then it can see the past and the
future, lying together and existing simultaneously.

That consciousness which is not bound by the conditions of sensuous
receptivity can outrun the stupid traveller, ascend the mountain to see
in the distance the town to which he is going, and be convinced that
this town is not being built anew for his arrival, but exists quite
independently of the stupid traveller. And that consciousness can look
off and see on the horizon the towers of that city where that traveller
had been, and be convinced that those towers have not fallen, that the
city continues to stay and live just as it stayed and lived before the
traveller's advent.

It can rise above the plane of time and see the spring behind and the
autumn ahead, see simultaneously the budding flowers and ripening
fruits. It can make *the blind man* recover his sight and see the road
along which he passed and that which still lies before him.

The past and the future cannot *not exist*, because if they do not exist
then neither does the present exist. Unquestionably they exist
*somewhere* together, but we do not see them.

The present, compared with the past and the future, is the most unreal
of all unrealities.

We are forced to admit that the past, the present and the future do not
differ in anything, one from another; there exists just *one
present*—*the Eternal Now* of Hindu philosophy. But we do not perceive
this, because in every given moment we experience just a

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

little bit of that present, and this alone we count as existent, denying
a real existence to everything else.

If we admit this, then our view of everything with which we are
surrounded will change very considerably.

Usually we regard time as *an abstraction*, made by us *during the
observation of really existing motion*. That is, we think that observing
motion, or changes of relations between things and comparing the
relations which existed before, which exist now, and which may exist in
the future, that we are deducing the idea of time. We shall see later on
how far this view is correct.

Thus the idea of time is composed of the conception of the past, of the
present, and of the future.

Our conceptions of the past and present, though not very clear, are yet
very much alike. As to *the future* there exists a great variety of
views.

It is necessary for us to analyze *the theories of the future* as they
exist in the mind of contemporary man.

There are in existence two theories—that of the foreordained future, and
that of the free future.

Foreordination is established in this way: we say that every future
event is the result of those which happened before, and is created such
as it will be and not otherwise as a consequence of a definite direction
of forces which are contained in preceding events. This means, in other
words, that future events are 'wholly contained in preceding ones, and
if we could know the force and direction of all events which have
happened up to the present moment, i.e., if we knew all the past, by
this we could know *all* the future. And sometimes, knowing the *present
moment* thoroughly, in all its details, we may really *foretell* the
future. If the prophecy is not fulfilled, we say that we *did not know
all that had been*, and we discover in the past some cause which had
escaped our observation.

The idea of the free future is founded upon the possibility of voluntary
action and *accidental* new combinations of causes. The future is
regarded as quite indefinite, or defined only in part, because in every
given moment new forces, new events and new phenomena are born which lie
in a potential state, not causeless, but so incommensurable with
causes—as the firing of a city from one spark—that it is impossible to
detect or measure them.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

This theory affirms that one and the same action can have different
results; one and the same cause, different effects; and it introduces
the hypothesis of quite arbitrary volitional actions on the part of a
man, bringing about profound changes in the subsequent events of his own
life and the lives of others.

Supporters of the foreordination theory contend on the contrary that
volitional, involuntary actions depend also upon causes, making them
necessary and unavoidable at a given moment; that there is nothing
accidental, and that there cannot be; that we call accidental only those
things the causes of which we do not see by reason of our limitations;
and that different effects of causes seemingly the same occur because
the causes are different in reality and only seem similar for the reason
that we do not understand them well enough nor see them sufficiently
clearly.

The dispute between the theory of the foreordained future and that of
the free future is an infinite dispute. Neither of these theories can
say anything decisive. This is so because both theories are too literal,
too inflexible, too material, and one repudiates the other: both say,
"either this or the other." In the one case there results a complete
cold predestination: *that which will be, will be, nothing can be
changed*—that which will befall tomorrow was predestined tens of
thousands of years ago. There results in the other case a life upon some
sort of needle-point called *the present*, which is surrounded on all
sides by an abyss of non-existence, *a journey in a country which does
not as yet exist*, a life in a world which is born and dies every
moment, in which *nothing ever returns*. And both these opposite views
are equally untrue, because the truth, in the given case, as in so many
others, is contained in a union of two opposite understandings in one.

In every given moment all the future of the world is predestined and is
existing, but is predestined conditionally, i.e., it will be such or
another future according to the direction of events at a given moment,
unless there enters *a new fact*, and a new fact can enter only from the
side of *consciousness* and the will resulting from it. It is necessary
to understand this, and to master it.

Besides this we are hindered from a right conception of the relation of
the present toward the future by our misunderstanding of the relation of
the present to the past. The difference of opinion

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

exists only concerning *the future*; concerning the past all agree that
it has passed, that it does not exist now!—*and that it was such as it
has been*. In this last lies the key to the understanding of the
incorrectness of our views of the future. As a matter of fact, in
reality our relation both to the past and to the future is far more
complicated than it seems to us. In the past, behind us, lies not only
that which really happened, *but that which could have been*. In the
same way, in the future lies not only that which will be, *but
everything that may be*.

The past and the future are equally undetermined, equally exist in all
their possibilities, and equally exist simultaneously with the present.

By time we mean *the distance* separating events in the order of their
succession and binding them in different wholes. This distance lies in a
direction not contained in *three-dimensional* space, therefore it will
be *the new dimension of space*.

*This new dimension satisfies all possible requirements of the fourth
dimension on the ground of the preceding reasoning*.

It is incommensurable with *the dimensions of three-dimensional space*,
as *a year* is incommensurable with St. Petersburg. It is perpendicular
to all directions of three-dimensional space and is not parallel to any
of them.

As a deduction from all the preceding we may say that *time* (as it is
usually understood) includes in itself *two ideas*: that of a certain to
us unknown space (the fourth dimension), and that of a motion upon this
space. Our constant mistake consists in the fact that in time we never
see two ideas, but see always only one. Usually we see in *time* the
idea of motion, but cannot say from whence, where, whither, nor upon
what space. Attempts have been made heretofore to unite the idea of the
fourth dimension with the idea of time. But in those theories which have
attempted to combine the idea of time with the idea of the fourth
dimension appeared always the idea of some spatial element as existing
in time, and along with it was admitted *motion upon that space*. Those
who were constructing these theories evidently did not understand that
leaving out the possibility of motion they were advancing the demand for
a new time, because motion cannot proceed out of time. And as a result
time goes ahead of us, like our shadow, receding according

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

as we approach it. All our perceptions of motion have become confused.
If we imagine the new dimension of space and *the possibility* of motion
upon this new dimension, time will still elude us, and declare that it
is unexplained, exactly as it was unexplained before.

It is necessary to admit that by one term, *time*, we designate really
two ideas—"a certain space" and "motion upon that space." This motion
does not exist in reality, and it seems to us as existing only because
we do not see the spatiality of time. That is, the sensation of motion
in time (and motion out of time does not exist) arises in us because we
are looking at the world as if through a narrow slit, and are seeing the
*lines of intersection* of the time-plane with our three-dimensional
space only.

Therefore it is necessary to declare how profoundly incorrect is our
usual theory that the idea of time is deduced by us from the observation
of motion, and is really nothing more than the idea of that succession
which is observed by us in motion.

It is necessary to recognize quite the reverse: that the idea of motion
is deduced by us out of an incomplete sensation of time, or of the
time-sense, i.e., out of a sense or sensation of the fourth dimension,
but out of an *incomplete* sensation. This incomplete sensation of time
(of the fourth dimension)—the sensation through the slit—gives us the
sensation of motion, that is, creates an illusion of motion which does
not exist in reality, but instead of which there exists in reality only
the extension upon a direction inconceivable to us.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

One other aspect of the question has very great significance. The fourth
dimension is bound up with the ideas of "time" and "motion." But up to
this point we shall not be able to understand *the fourth dimension*
unless we shall understand the fifth dimension.

Attempting to look at time as at an object, Kant says that it has one
dimension: i.e., he imagines time as a line extending from the infinite
future into the infinite past. Of one point of this line we are
conscious—always only one point. And this point has no dimension because
that which in the usual sense we call the present, is the recent past,
and sometimes also the near future.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

This would be true in relation to our *illusory* perception of time. But
in reality *eternity* is not the infinite dimension of time, but the one
*perpendicular to time*; because, if eternity exists, then every moment
is eternal. The line of time extends in that order of succession of
phenomena which are in causal interdependence—first the cause, then the
effect: before, now, after. *The line of eternity* extends
perpendicularly to that line.

It is impossible to understand the idea of time without conceiving in
imagination the idea of eternity; it is likewise impossible to
understand space if we have no idea of time.

From the standpoint of eternity, *time* does not differ in anything from
the other lines and dimensions of space—length, breadth, and height.
This means that just as in space exist the things that we do not see, or
speaking differently, not alone that which we see, so in time "events"
exist before our consciousness has touched them, and they still exist
after our consciousness has left them behind.

Consequently, *extension in time* is extension into unknown space, and
therefore time is *the fourth dimension of space*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

It is necessary that we should regard time *as a spatial conception*
considered with relation to our two data—the world and consciousness
(psychic life).

The idea of time arises through the knowledge of the world by means of
sensuous receptivity. It has been previously explained that because of
the properties of our sensuous receptivity we see the world as through a
narrow slit.

Out of this the following questions arise:

1\. What accounts for the existence in the world of illusionary motion?
That is, why do we not see, through this slit, *the same thing*? Why,
behind the slit, do changes proceed creating the illusion of motion:
that is, how and in what manner does the focus of our receptivity run
over the world of phenomena? In addition to all this it is necessary to
remember that through the same slit through which we see the world we
observe ourselves and see in ourselves changes similar to the changes in
the rest of things.

2\. Why can we not extend that slit?

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

It is necessary to answer these questions.

First of all it is important to note that within the limits of our usual
observation our receptivity is always conditioned in the same way and
cannot escape these conditions. In other words, it is chained, as it
were, to some plane above which it cannot rise. These *conditions*, or
that *plane* we call, in the inner world, consciousness or level of
consciousness; in the outer world we call them *matter* or the density
of matter. (The word density is used in this connection not in the sense
of a solid, liquid or gaseous state, but in the sense of the physical,
the astral and the mental plane—accepting temporarily the terminology
employed in contemporary theosophical literature.) Our usual psychic
life proceeds upon some definite plane (of consciousness or matter) and
never rises above it. If our receptivity could rise above this plane it
would undoubtedly perceive *simultaneously*, below itself, a far greater
number of events than it usually sees while on a plane. Just as a man,
ascending a mountain, or going up in a balloon, begins to see
*simultaneously* and *at once* many things which it is impossible to see
simultaneously and at once from below—the movement of two trains toward
one another between which a collision will occur; the approach of an
enemy detachment to a sleeping camp; two cities divided by a ridge,
etc.—so consciousness rising above the plane in which it usually
functions, must see simultaneously the events divided for ordinary
consciousness by *periods of time*. These will be the events which
ordinary consciousness *never* sees together, as: *cause* and *effect*;
the work and the payment; the crime and the punishment; the movement of
trains toward one another and their collision; the approach of the enemy
and the battle; the sunrise and the sunset; the morning and the evening;
the day and the night; spring, autumn, summer and winter; the birth and
the death of a man.

The angle of vision will enlarge during such an ascent, the moment will
expand.

If we imagine a receptivity which is on a level higher than *our
consciousness*, possessing a broader angle of view, then this
receptivity will be able to grasp, as something simultaneous, i.e., *as
a moment*, all that is happening for us during a certain length of
time—minutes, hours, a day, a month. Within the limits of its moment
such a receptivity will not be in a position to discriminate

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

between *before*, *now*, *after*; all this will be for it *now*. Now
will expand.

But in order for this to *happen* it would be necessary for us to
liberate ourselves from matter, because matter is nothing more than the
conditions of space and time in which we dwell. Thence arises the
question: can consciousness leave the conditions of a given material
existence without itself undergoing fundamental changes, or without
disappearing altogether, as men of positivistic views would affirm?

This is a debatable question, and later I shall give examples and
proofs, speaking on behalf of the idea that our consciousness can leave
the conditions of a given materiality. For the present I wish to
establish *what must proceed* during this leaving.

There would ensue *the expansion of the moment*, i.e., all that we are
apprehending *in time* would become something like a single moment, in
which the past, the present, and the future would be seen at once. This
shows the relativity of motion, as depending for us upon the limitation
of the moment, which includes only a very small part of the moments of
life perceived by us.

We have a perfect right to say, not that "*time*" is deduced from
"motion," but that motion is sensed because of the *time-sense*. We have
that sense, therefore we sense motion. The time-sense is the sensation
of changing moments. If we did not have this time-sense we could not
feel motion. The "time-sense" is itself, in substance, *the limit* or
*the surface* of our "space-sense." Where the "space-sense" ends, there
the "time-sense" begins. It has been made clear that "time" is identical
in its properties with "space," i.e., it has all the signs of *space
extension*. However, we do not feel it as spatial extension, but we feel
it as time, that is, as something specific, inexpressible—in other
words, uninterruptedly bound up with "motion." This inability to sense
time spatially has its origin in the fact that the time-sense is a
*misty space-sense*; by means of our time-sense we feel obscurely the
new characteristics of space, which extend out from the sphere of three
dimensions.

But what is the time-sense and why does there arise the illusion of
motion?

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

To answer this question at all satisfactorily is possible only by
studying the forms and levels of psychic life.

"I" is a complicated quantity, and within it goes on a continuous
motion. About the nature of this motion we shall speak later, but this
very motion inside of us creates the illusion of motion around us,
motion in the material world.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The noted mathematician Riemann understood that when higher dimensions
of space are in question, *time, by some means, translates itself into
space*, and he regarded the MATERIAL ATOM as *the entrance of the fourth
dimension into three-dimensional space*.

In one of his books Hinton writes very interestingly about "surface
tensions."

The relationship of a surface to a solid or of a solid to a higher solid
is one which we often find in nature.

A surface is nothing more nor less than the relation between two things.
Two bodies touch each other. The surface is the relationship of one to
the other.

If our space is in the same co-relation with higher space as is the
surface to our space, then it may be that our space is really the
surface, that is, the place of contact, of two higher-dimensional
spaces.

It is a fact worthy of notice that in the surface of a fluid different
laws obtain from those which hold throughout the mass. There is a whole
series of facts which are grouped together under the name of surface
tensions, which are of great importance in physics, and by which the
behavior of the surfaces of liquids is governed.

And it may well be that the laws of our universe are the surface
tensions of a higher universe.

If the surface be regarded as a medium lying between bodies, then indeed
it will have no weight, but be a powerful means of transmitting
vibrations. Moreover, it would be unlike any other substance, and it
would be impossible to get rid of it. However perfect a vacuum be made,
there would be in this vacuum just as much of this unknown medium (i.e.,
of that surface) as there was before.

Matter would pass freely through this medium . . . vibrations of this
medium would tear asunder portions of matter. And involuntarily the
conclusion would be drawn that this medium was unlike any ordinary
matter. . . . These would be very different properties to reconcile in
one and the same substance.

Now is there anything in our experience which corresponds to this
medium? . . .

Do we suppose the existence of any medium through which matter freely
moves, which yet by its vibrations destroys the combinations of
matter—some medium which is present in every vacuum however perfect,
which penetrates all bodies, is weightless, and yet can never be laid
hold of.

The "substance" which possesses all these qualities is called the
"ether."

The properties of the ether are a perpetual object of investigation in
science. . . . But taking into consideration the ideas expressed before
it would be interesting to look at the world supposing that we are not
in it but on the ether; where the "ether" is the surface of contact of
two bodies of higher dimensions. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

Hinton here expresses an unusually interesting thought, and brings the
idea of the "ether" nearer to the idea of time. The materialistic, or
even the energetic understanding of contemporary physics of the ether is
perfectly fruitless—a dead-end siding. For Hinton the ether is not a
substance but only a "surface," the "boundary" of something. But of
what? Again not that of a *substance*, but the boundary, the surface,
the limit of *one form* of *receptivity* and the beginning of another. .
. .

In one sentence the walls and fences of the materialistic dead-end
siding are broken down and before our thought open wide horizons of
regions unexplored.
