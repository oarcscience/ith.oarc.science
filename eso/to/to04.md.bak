THE most difficult thing is to know what we do know, and what we do not
know.

Therefore, desiring to know anything, we shall before all else determine
WHAT we accept as *given*, and WHAT as demanding definition and proof;
that is, determine WHAT we know already, and WHAT we wish to know.

In relation to the knowledge of the world and of ourselves, the
conditions would be ideal could we venture to accept *nothing* as given,
and count *all* as demanding definition and proof. In other words, it
would be best to assume that we know nothing, and make this our point of
departure.

But unfortunately such conditions are impossible to create. Knowledge
must start from some foundation, something must be recognized as known;
otherwise we shall be obliged always to de-fine one unknown by means of
another.

Looking at the matter from another point of view, we shall hesitate to
accept as the known things—as the *given* ones—those in the main
completely unknown, only presupposed, and therefore *the things sought
for*. Should we do this, we are likely to fall into such a dilemma as
that in which positive philosophy now finds itself—and by positive
philosophy I mean a general trend of thought

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

based on the data of those sciences which are now accepted as
experimental and positive. This philosophy is founded on the existence
of *matter* (materialism) or *energy*: that is, of a force, or *motion*,
(energeticism); though in reality matter and motion were always the
unknown x and y, and were defined by means of one another.

It must be perfectly clear to everyone that it is impossible to accept
*the thing sought as the given*; and impossible to define one unknown by
means of another. The result is nothing but the identity of the unknown:
x=y, y=x.

This *identity of the unknown* is the ultimate conclusion to which
positive philosophy comes.

*Matter is that in which proceed the changes called motion: and motions
are those changes which proceed in matter*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

But what do we know?

We know that with the very first awakening of knowledge, man is
confronted with two obvious facts:

*The existence of the world in which he lives; and the existence of
psychic life in himself*.

Neither of these can he prove or disprove, but they are *facts*: they
constitute *reality* for him.

It is possible to meditate upon the mutual correlation of these two
facts. It is possible to try to reduce them to one; that is, to regard
the psychic or inner world as a part, reflection, or function of the
world, or the world as a part, reflection, or function of that inner
world. But such a procedure constitutes a departure from facts, and all
such considerations of the world and of the self, to the ordinary
non-philosophical mind, will not have the character of obviousness. On
the contrary the sole *obvious fact* remains the antithesis of *I* and
*Not-I*—our inner psychic life and the outer world.,

Further on we shall return to this fundamental thesis. But thus far we
have no basis on which to found a contradiction of the obvious fact of
the existence of *ourselves*—i.e., of our inner life—and of the *world*
in which we live. This we shall therefore accept as *the given*.

This however is the only thing that we have the right to accept as

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

given: all the rest demands proof and definition in terms of these two
given data.

*Space*, with its extension; *time*, with the idea of *before*, *now*,
*after*; quantity, mass, substantiality; number, equality and
inequality; identity and difference; cause and effect; the ether, atoms,
electrons, energy, life, death—all things that form the foundation of
our so-called knowledge: *these are the unknown things*.

The existence in us of psychic life, i.e., of sensations, perceptions,
conceptions, reasoning, feeling, desires etc., and the existence of the
world outside of us—from these two fundamental data immediately proceed
our common and clearly understood division of everything that we know
into *subjective* and *objective*.

Everything that we accept as a property of the world, we call objective;
and everything that we accept as a property of our psyche, we call
subjective.

The subjective world we recognize *directly*: it is in ourselves—we are
one with it.

The objective world we picture to ourselves as existing somewhere
outside of us—we and it are different things.

It seems to us that if we should close our eyes, then the objective
world would continue to exist, such as we just saw it; and if our inner
life were to disappear, so would the subjective world disappear—yet the
objective world would exist as before, as it existed at the time when we
were not; when our subjective world was not.

Our relation to the objective world is most exactly defined by the fact
that we perceive it as existing in *time* and *space*; otherwise, out of
these conditions, we can neither conceive nor imagine it. In general, we
say that the objective world consists of things and phenomena, i.e.,
things and changes in states of things. The PHENOMENA exist for us in
time; the THINGS, in space.

But such a division of the subjective and the objective world does not
satisfy us.

By means of reasoning we can establish the fact that in reality we know
only our own sensations, perceptions and conceptions, and we cognize the
objective world by projecting outside of ourselves the causes of our
sensations, presupposing them to contain these causes.

Then we find that our knowledge of the subjective world, and of

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

the objective world also, can be *true* and *false*, correct and
incorrect.

The criterion for the definition of correctness or incorrectness of our
knowledge of the subjective world is the *form* of the relations of one
sensation to others, and the *force* and character of the *sensation
itself*. In other words, the correctness of one sensation is verified by
the comparison of it with another of which we are more sure, or *by the
intensity and "taste" of a given sensation*.

The criterion for the definition of correctness or incorrectness of our
knowledge of the objective world *is the very same*. It seems to us that
we define the things and phenomena of the objective world by means of
comparing them among themselves; and we think we find the laws of their
existence *outside of us*, and independent of our perception of them.
But it is an illusion. We know nothing about things *separately from
us*; and we have no other means of verifying the correctness of our
knowledge of the objective world than BY SENSATIONS.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Since the remotest antiquity the question of our relation to the true
causes of our sensations has constituted the main subject of
philosophical research. Men have always felt that they should have some
solution for this question, some answer for it. And these answers have
vacillated between two poles, from the full negation of the causes
themselves, and the assertion that the causes of sensations are
contained within ourselves and not in anything outside of us—up to the
recognition that we know these causes, that they are embodied in the
phenomena of the outer world, that these phenomena constitute the cause
of sensations; and that the cause of all observed phenomena lies in the
movement of "atoms," and the oscillations of the "ether." It is believed
that if we cannot observe these motions and oscillations it is only
because we have not sufficiently powerful instruments, and that when
such instruments are at our disposal we shall be able to see the
movements of atoms as well as we see, through powerful telescopes, stars
the very existence of which were never guessed.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

In modern philosophy Kant's system occupies a middle position in
relation to this problem of the causes of sensations, not sharing either
of these extreme views. Kant proved that the causes of our sensations
are in the outside world, but that we cannot know these causes through
any sensuous approach—that is, by such means as we know phenomena—and
that we *cannot know* these causes, and *shall never know them*.

Kant established the fact that everything that is known through the
senses is known in terms of time and space, and that out of time and
space we cannot know anything by way of the senses; that time and space
are necessary conditions of sensuous receptivity (i.e., receptivity by
means of the five organs of sense). Moreover, what is most important, he
established the fact that extension in space and existence in time are
not properties *appertaining to things*, but just [the](errata.htm#3.md)
properties of our sensuous receptivity; that in reality, apart from our
sensuous knowledge of them, things exist independently of time and
space; but we can never perceive them out of time and space, and
perceiving things and phenomena thus sensuously, by virtue of it we
*impose* upon them the conditions of time and space, as belonging to
*our* form of perception.

Thus space and time, defining everything that we cognize by sensuous
means, are in themselves just forms of our receptivity, categories of
our intellect, the prism through which we regard the world—or in other
words, space and time do not represent properties of the world, but just
properties of our *knowledge* of the world gained through our sensuous
organism. From this it follows that the world, apart from our knowledge
of it, has neither extension in space nor existence in time; these are
properties which we add to it.

Cognitions of space and time arise *in our intellect* during its touch
with the external world by means of the organs of sense, and do not
exist in the external world apart from our contact with it.

Space and time are *categories of intellect*, i.e., properties which are
*ascribed* by us to the external world. They are signal posts, signs put
up by ourselves because we cannot picture the external world without
their help. They are *graphics* by which we represent

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the world to ourselves. Projecting outside of ourselves the causes of
our sensations, we are designing those causes in space, and we picture
continuous reality to ourselves as a series of moments of time following
one another. This is necessary for us because a thing having no definite
extension in space, not occupying a certain part of space and not
lasting a certain length of time, does not exist for us at all. That is,
a thing not in space, divorced from the idea of space, and not included
in the category of space, will not differ from some other thing in any
particular; it will occupy the very same place, will coincide with it.
Also, all *phenomena* not in time, divorced from the idea of time, not
taken in this or that fashion from the standpoint of *before*, *now*,
*after*, would co-exist for us simultaneously, and all mixed up with one
another, and our weak mind would not be able to distinguish *one moment*
in the infinite variety.

Therefore our consciousness segregates, out of a chaos of impressions,
separate groups, and we construct in space and time the perceptions of
things according to these groups of impressions.

It is necessary for us to divide things *somehow*, and we divide them
into the categories of space and time.

But we should remember that these divisions exist only in us, in our
knowledge of things and not in the things themselves; that we do not
know the true relations of things among themselves, and the real things
we do not know, but only phantoms, visions of things—we do not know the
relation existing among the things in reality. At the same time we quite
definitely know that *our* division of things into the categories of
space and time does not at all correspond to the division of *things in
themselves*, independently of our receptivity of them; and we quite
definitely know that if there exist any division at all among *things in
themselves*, it will in no case be a division in terms of space and time
according to our usual understanding of these words, because such a
division is not a property of things, but of our knowledge of things
gained through the senses. Moreover, we do not know if it is even
possible to distinguish *those divisions which we see*, i.e., in space
and time, if things are looked at not through human eyes, not from the
human [standpoint](errata.htm#4.md). In point of fact we do not know but
that

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

our world would present an entirely different aspect for a differently
built organism.

We cannot *perceive* things as *images* outside of the categories of
space and time, but we constantly *think* of them outside of space and
time.

When we say *that table*, we picture the table to ourselves in space and
time; but when we say *an object made of wood*, not meaning any definite
thing, but speaking generally, it will relate to all things made of wood
throughout the world, and in all ages. An imaginative person could
conceive that we are referring to some great thing made of wood,
composed of all objects whenever and wherever *wooden* things existed,
these forming its constituent *atoms*, as it were.

We do not comprehend all these matters quite clearly, but in general it
is plain that we think in space and time by perceptions only; but by
concepts we think independently of space and time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kant named his views *critical idealism*, in contradiction to *dogmatic
idealism*, of [which](errata.htm#5.md) Berkeley was a representative.

According to dogmatic idealism, all the world, all things—i.e., the true
causes of our sensations—do not exist except in our consciousness: they
*exist* only so far as we know them. The entire world perceived by us is
just a reflection of ourselves.

Kantian idealism recognizes a world of causes outside of us, but asserts
that we cannot know the world by means of sensuous perception, and
everything that we perceive, generally speaking, is of our own
creation—*the product of a cognizing being*.

So, according to Kant, everything that we find in things is put in them
by ourselves. Independently of ourselves we do not know what the world
is like. And our cognition of things has nothing in common with the
things as they are outside of us—that is, in themselves. Furthermore,
and most important, our ignorance of things in themselves does not
depend upon our *insufficient knowledge*, but is due to the fact that by
means of sensuous perception we cannot know the world correctly *at
all*. That is

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

to say, we cannot truly declare that although now we perhaps know
little, presently we shall know more, and at length shall come to a
correct understanding of the world. It is not true because our
experimental knowledge is not a *confused* perception of a *real world*.
It is *a very acute* perception of *an entirely unreal world* appearing
round about us at the moment of our contact with the world of true
causes, to which we cannot find the way because we are lost in an unreal
"material" world. For this reason the extension of the objective
sciences does not bring us any nearer to the knowledge of *things in
themselves*, or of *true causes*.

In *A Critique of Pure Reason* Kant affirms that:

Nothing which is intuited in space is a thing in itself, and space is
not a form which belongs as a property to things; but objects are quite
unknown to us in themselves, and what we call outward objects are
nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility, whose form is
space, but whose real correlated thing in itself is not known by means
of these representations, nor ever can be, but respecting which, in
experience, no inquiry is ever made.

The things which we intuit are not in themselves the same as our
representation of them in intuition, nor are their relations in
themselves so constituted as they appear to us; and if we take away the
subject, or even only the subjective constitution of our senses in
general, then not only the nature and relations of objects in space and
time disappear, but even space and time themselves.

What may be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves and
without reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite unknown
to us. We know nothing more than our own *mode* of perceiving them,
which is peculiar to us and which though not of necessity pertaining to
every animated being, is so to the whole human race.

Supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition even to the very
highest degree of clearness we should not thereby advance one step
nearer to the constitution of objects as things in themselves.

To say then that our sensibility is nothing but the confused
representation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to
them as things in themselves, and this under an accumulation of
characteristic marks and partial representations which we cannot
distinguish in consciousness, is a falsification of the conception of
sensibility and phenomenization, which renders our whole doctrine
thereof empty and

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="small">useless. The difference between a confused and a
clear representation is merely logical, and has nothing to do with
content.</span>

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Up to the present time Kant's propositions have remained in the very
form that he left them. Despite the multiplicity of new philosophical
systems which appeared during the nineteenth century, and despite the
number of philosophers who have particularly studied, commented upon,
and interpreted Kant's writings, Kant's principal propositions have
remained quite undeveloped, primarily because most people do not know
how to read Kant at all, and they therefore dwell upon the unimportant
and non-essential, ignoring the substance.

Yet really Kant simply put the question, threw to the world the problem,
demanding the solution but not pointing the way toward it.

This fact is usually omitted when speaking of Kant. He propounded the
riddle, but did not give the solution of it.

And to the present day we repeat Kant's propositions, we consider them
incontrovertible, but in the main we represent them to our understanding
very badly, and they are not correlated with other departments of our
knowledge. *All our positive science—physics (with chemistry) and
biology—is built upon hypotheses* CONTRADICTORY *to Kant's
propositions*.

Moreover, we do not realize how we ourselves impose upon the world the
properties of space, i.e., extension; nor do we realize how the
world—earth, sea, trees, men—*cannot possess* such extension.

We do not understand how we can see and *measure* that extension if *it
does not exist*—nor what the world represents in itself, if it does not
possess extension.

But does the world really exist? Or, as a logical conclusion from Kant's
ideas, shall we recognize the validity of Berkeley's idea, and deny the
existence of the world itself except in imagination?

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Positive philosophy stands in a very ambiguous relation to Kant's views.
It accepts them and it does not accept them: it accepts,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

and considers them correct in their relation to the direct experience of
the organs of sense—what we see, hear, touch. That is, positive
philosophy recognizes the subjectivity of our receptivity, and
recognizes everything that we perceive in objects as imposed upon them
by ourselves—but this in relation to the direct experience of the senses
only.

When it concerns itself with "scientific experience" however, in which
precise instruments and calculations are used, positive philosophy
evidently considers Kant's view in relation to that invalid, assuming
that "scientific experience" makes known to us the very substance of
things, the true causes of our sensations—or if it does not do so now,
it brings us closer to the truth of things, and can inform us later.

Contrary to Kant, the positivists are sure that "more clear knowledge of
phenomena makes them acquainted with things in themselves." They think
that in looking upon physical phenomena as the motions of the ether, or
as electrical or magnetic phenomena, and calculating their motions, they
begin to know the very substance of things, i.e., the causes of
phenomena; in other words, they *believe* exactly in the possibility of
what Kant denied—the comprehension of the true substance of things by
means of the investigation of phenomena. Moreover many physicists do not
consider it necessary even to know Kant; and they could not themselves
exactly define in what relation they stand toward him. Of course it is
possible not to know Kant, but it is impossible to controvert him. Every
description of physical phenomena, by its every word, is related to the
problems set forth by Kant—remains in this or that relation to them.

In general, the position of "science" in regard to this question of
"*subjectively imposed*" or "*objectively cognized*" is more than
tottering, and in order to form its conclusions "science" is forced to
accept many purely hypothetical suppositions as things known—as
indubitable *data*, not demanding proof.

Moreover, physicists forget one very significant fact: in his book,
*Analysis of Sensations*, Mach says:

<span class="small">In the investigation of purely physical processes we
generally employ concepts of so abstract a character that as a rule we
think only cursorily, or not at all, of the sensations (elements) that
lie at their base. . .</span>

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">The foundation of all purely physical operations is based
upon an almost unending series of sensations, particularly if we take
into consideration the adjustment of the apparatus which must precede
the actual experiment. Now it can easily happen to the *physicist* who
does not study the *psychology* of his operations, that he does not (to
reverse a well-known saying) see the trees for the wood, that he
overlooks the sensory element at the foundation of his work. . .
Psychological analysis has taught us that this is not surprising, since
the physicist is *always* operating with sensations. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)</span>

Mach here calls attention to a very important thing. Physicists de not
consider it necessary to know psychology and to deal with it in their
conclusions.

But when they are more or less acquainted with psychology, with that
part of it which treats of the forms of receptivity, and take it into
consideration, then they hold the most fantastic duality of opinion, as
in the case of the man of orthodox belief who tries to reconcile the
dogmas of faith with the arguments of reason, and who is obliged to
believe simultaneously in the creation of the world in seven days, seven
thousand years ago, and in geological periods hundreds of thousands of
years long, and in the evolutionary theory. He is thus forced to resort
to sophisms, and demonstrate that by *seven days* is meant *seven
periods*. But why seven, exactly, he is unable to explain. For
physicists the rôle of the "creation of the world" is played by the
atomic theory and the ether, with its wave-like vibrations, and further
by the electrons, and the energetic, or electromagnetic theory of the
world.

Or sometimes it is even worse, for the physicist in the depth of his
soul feels the falsity of all old and new scientific theories but fears
to hang in the air, as it were; to take refuge in mere negation. He has
no system in place of that whose falsity he already feels; he is afraid
to make a plunge into mere emptiness. Lacking sufficient courage to
declare *that he believes in nothing at all*, he accoutres himself in
all contradictory theories, as in an official uniform, only because with
this uniform are bound up certain rights and privileges, outer as well
as inner, consisting of a certain confidence in himself and in his
surroundings, to forego which he has no strength and determination. The
unbelieving positivist—this is the tragic figure of our times, analogous
to the atheist or unbelieving priest of the times of Voltaire.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Out of this abhorrence of a vacuum come all dualistic theories which
recognize "spirit" and "matter" existing simultaneously and
independently of one another.

 

In general, to a disinterested observer, the state of our contemporary
science should be of great psychological interest. In all branches of
scientific knowledge we are absorbing an enormous number of facts
destructive of the harmony of existing systems. And these systems can
maintain themselves only by reason of the heroic attempts of scientific
men who are trying to close their eyes to a long series of new facts
which threatens to submerge everything in an irresistible stream. If in
reality we were to collect these system-destroying facts they would be
so numerous in every department of knowledge as to exceed those upon
which existing systems are founded. The systematization of *that which
we do not know* may yield us more for the true understanding of the
world and the self than the systematization of that which in the opinion
of "exact science" we do know.
