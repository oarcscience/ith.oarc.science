</div>

THERE exist visible and hidden causes of phenomena; there exist also
visible and hidden effects. Let us consider some one example. In all
textbooks on the history of literature we are told that in its time
Goethe's *Werther* provoked an epidemic of suicides.

What did provoke these suicides?

Let us imagine that some "scientist" appears, who, being interested in
the fact of the increase of suicides, begins to study the first edition
of *Werther* according to the method of exact, positive science. He
weighs the book, measures it by the most precise instruments, notes the
number of its pages, makes a chemical analysis of the paper and the ink,
counts the number of lines on every page, the number of letters, and
even how many times the letter A is repeated, how many times the letter
B, and how many times the interrogation mark is used, and so on. In
other words he does everything that the pious Mohammedan performs with
relation to the Koran of Mohammed, and on the basis of his
investigations writes a treatise on the relation of the letter A of the
German alphabet to suicide.

Or let us imagine another scientist who studies the history of painting,
and deciding to put it on a scientific basis, starts a lengthy series of
analyses of the pigment used in the pictures of famous painters in order
to discover the causes of the different impressions produced upon the
beholder by different pictures.

Imagine a savage studying a watch. Let us admit that he is a wise and
crafty savage. He takes the watch apart and counts all

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

its wheels and screws, counts the number of teeth in each gear, finds
out its size and thickness. The only thing that he does not know is
*what all these things are for*. He does not know that the hand
completes the circuit of the dial in half of twenty-four hours, i.e.,
*that it is possible to tell time by means of a watch*.

All this is "positivism."

We are too familiar with "positivistic" methods, and so fail to realize
that they end in absurdities and that if we are seeking *to explain the
meaning* of anything, they do not lead to the goal at all.

The difficulty is that for the *explanation of the meaning* positivism
is of no use. For it nature is a closed book of which it studies the
appearance only.

In the matter of the study of the *operations* of nature, the positive
methods have achieved much, as is proven by the innumerable successes of
modern technics, including the conquest of the air. But everything in
the world has its own definite sphere of action. Positivism is very good
when it seeks an answer to the question of *how* something operates
under given conditions; but when it makes the attempt to get outside of
its definite conditions (space, time, causation), or presumes to affirm
that nothing exists outside of these given conditions, then it is
transcending its own proper sphere.

It is true that the more serious positive thinkers deny the possibility
of including in "positive investigation" the question of *why* and *what
for*. But as a matter of fact the positive standpoint is not the only
possible one. The usual mistake of positivism consists in its not seeing
anything *except itself*—it either considers everything as possible to
it, or considers as generally impossible much that is entirely possible,
*but not for* positive inquiry.

Humanity will never cease to search, however, for answer to the
questions *why*, and *wherefore*.

The positivistic scientist finds himself in the presence of nature
almost in the position of a savage in a library of rare and valuable
books. For a savage a book is *a thing* of definite size and weight.
However long he may ask himself what purpose this strange thing serves,
he will never discover the truth from its appearance; and *the contents
of the book* will remain for him the *incomprehensible noumenon*. In
like manner the contents of nature are incomprehensible to the
positivistic scientist.

But if a man *knows* of the existence of the contents of the book—

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

the *noumenon* of life—if he knows that a mysterious meaning is hidden
under visible phenomena, there is the possibility that in the long run
he will discover the contents.

For success in this it is necessary to grasp the *idea* of the inner
contents, i.e., the meaning of the thing in itself.

The scientist who discovers little tablets with hieroglyphics, or
wedge-shaped inscriptions in an unknown language, deciphers and reads
them after great labor. And in order to accomplish this he needs only
one thing: it is necessary for him to know that these little signs
*represent an inscription*. As long as he regards them simply as an
ornament, as the outside embellishment of little tablets, or as an
accidental tracing without meaning—up to that time their meaning and
significance will be closed to him absolutely. But let him only assume
the existence of that meaning and the possibility of its comprehension
will be already within sight.

No secret cipher exists which cannot be solved without the aid of any
key. *But it is necessary to know that it is a cipher*. This is the
first and necessary condition. Lacking this it is impossible to
accomplish anything.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The idea of the existence of the visible and the hidden sides of life
was known to philosophy long ago. *Phenomena* were regarded as only one
aspect of the world, and as being infinitely small compared to the
hidden aspect—*seeming*, not existing really, arising in consciousness
at the moment of its contact with the real world. Another side,
*noumena*, was recognized as really existing in itself, but inaccessible
for our receptivity.

But there is no greater error than to regard the world as *divided* into
phenomena and noumena—to conceive of phenomena and noumena apart from
one another, and susceptible of being separately known. This is
philosophic illiteracy, which shows itself most clearly in the dualistic
*spiritistic* theories. The division into phenomena and noumena exists
only in our minds. The "phenomenal world" is simply our incorrect
perception of the world.

As Carl DuPrel has said, "*The world beyond is this world, only
perceived strangely*." It would be more accurate to say, that *this
world is the world beyond perceived strangely*.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

Kant's idea is quite correct, that the study of the phenomenal side of
the world will not bring us any nearer to the understanding of
"things-in-themselves." The "thing-in-itself"—that is the thing as it
exists in itself, *independently of us*. The "phenomenon of the
thing"—that is the thing in such semblance as we perceive it.

The example of a book in the hands of an illiterate savage shows us
quite clearly that it is sufficient not to know about the existence of
the noumenon of a thing (the contents of the book in this case) in order
that it shall not manifest itself in phenomena. On the other hand, the
knowledge of its existence is sufficient to make possible its discovery
with the aid of the very phenomena which, without the knowledge of the
noumenon, would be perfectly useless.

Just as it is impossible for a savage to attain to an understanding of
the nature of a watch by a study of its phenomenal side—the number of
wheels, and the number of teeth in each gear—so also for the
positivistic scientist, studying the external, *manifesting* side of
life, its secret *raison d’être* and the *aim* of separate
manifestations will be forever hidden.

To the savage the watch will be an extremely interesting, complicated,
but entirely useless toy. Somewhat after this manner a *man* appears to
the scientist-materialist—a mechanism infinitely more complex, but
equally unknown as regards the purpose for which it exists and the
manner of its creation.

We pictured to ourselves how incomprehensible the functions of *a
candle* and of *a coin* would be for a plane-man, studying *two similar
circles* on his plane. In like manner the functions of a man are in
comprehensible to the scientist, studying him as a *mechanism*. The
reason for this is clear. It is because the coin and the candle are not
*two similar circles*, but two different objects, having an entirely
different use and meaning in that world which is relatively higher than
the plane—and man is *not a mechanism*, but something having an aim and
meaning in the world relatively higher than the visible one.

The functions of a candle and of a coin in our world are for the
imaginary plane-man an inaccessible *noumenon*. It is evident that the
phenomenon of a circle cannot give any understanding of the function of
a candle, and its difference from the function of a coin. But
*two-dimensional knowledge* exists not alone on the plane. Materialistic
thought tries to apply it to real life. A curious result

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

follows, the true meaning of which is, unhappily, incomprehensible to
many people. One of such applications is "the economic man"—this is
quite clearly the two-dimensional and flat being moving in two
directions—those of production and consumption—i.e., living upon the
plane of *production-consumption*. How is it possible to imagine man in
general as such an obviously artificial being? And how is it possible to
hope to understand the laws of the life of man, with his complex
spiritual aspirations and his great impulse to *know*, to understand
everything around about him and within himself—by studying the imaginary
laws of the imaginary being upon an imaginary plane? The inventors of
this theory alone possess the secret of the answer to this question. But
the economic theory of human life attracts men as do all simple theories
giving a short answer to a series of complicated questions. And we are
ourselves too entangled in materialistic theories to see anything beyond
them.

\_\_\_\_\_

Positivistic science does not really deny the theory of phenomena and
noumena, it only affirms, in opposition to Kant, that in studying
phenomena we are gradually approaching to noumena. The noumena of
phenomena science considers to be the motion of atoms and the ether, or
the vibrations of electrons; it conceives of the universe as a whirl of
mechanical motion or the field of manifestation of electro-magnetic
energy taking on the "phenomenal tint" for us on their reception by the
organs of sense.

"Positivism" affirms that the phenomena of life and psychic phenomena
are simply the functions of physical phenomena, that without physical
phenomena the phenomena of life, thought and emotion cannot exist and
that they represent only certain complex combinations of the foregoing;
and furthermore that all these three kinds of phenomena are one and the
same thing in substance—and the *higher*, i.e., the phenomena of life
and of consciousness, are only different expressions of the *lower*,
i.e., of one and the same physico-mechanical or electro-magnetic energy.

But to all this it is possible to answer one thing. If it were true it
would have been proven long ago. Nothing is easier than to prove the
energetic hypothesis of life and the psyche. Just *create* 

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

*life and thought* by the mechanical method. Materialism and energetics
are those "obvious" theories which *cannot be true without proofs*,
because they cannot *not* have proofs if they contain even a little
grain of truth.

But there are no proofs at the disposition of these theories; quite the
reverse: the infinitely greater potentiality of the phenomena of life
and the psyche compared with physical phenomena assures us of the exact
opposite.

The simple fact, above shown, of the enormous liberating, unbinding
force of psychic phenomena is sufficient to establish quite really and
firmly the problem of *the world of the hidden*.

And the world of the hidden cannot be the world of unconscious
mechanical motion, of unconscious development of electro-magnetic
forces. The positivistic theory admits the possibility of explaining the
*higher* through the *lower*, the *invisible* through the *visible*. But
it has been shown at the very beginning that this is the explanation of
one unknown by another unknown. There is still less justification for
explaining the *known* through the *unknown*. Yet that "lower" (matter
and motion) through which the positivists strive to explain the "higher"
(life and thought) is *itself unknown*. Consequently it is impossible to
explain and define anything else in terms of it, while the *higher*,
i.e., the *thought*, this is our sole *known*: it is this alone that we
do know, that we are conscious of in ourselves, that we can neither
mistake nor doubt. And if thought can evoke or *unbind* physical energy,
and motion can *never* create or unbind thought (out of a revolving
wheel no thought ever arose) so of course we shall strive to define, not
the higher in terms of the lower, but the lower in terms of the higher.
If the invisible, like *the contents of a book* or *the purpose of a
watch*, defines by itself the visible, so also we shall endeavor to
understand not the visible, but the invisible.

Starting from a false assumption concerning the *mechanicality* of the
noumenal side of nature, positive science, upon which the view of the
world of the intelligent majority of contemporary humanity is founded,
makes still another mistake in regard to cause and effect, or the law of
functions—that is, it mistakes what is cause, and what is effect.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

Just as the two-dimensional plane-man thinks of all phenomena touching
his consciousness as lying on one plane, so the positivistic method
strives to interpret upon one plane all phenomena of different orders,
i.e., to interpret all visible phenomena as the effects of antecedent
visible phenomena, and as the inevitable cause of subsequent visible
phenomena. In other words, it sees in causal and functional
interdependence merely phenomena proceeding upon the surface, and
studies the visible world, or the phenomena of the visible world, not
admitting that causes can enter into this world which are not contained
in it or that the phenomena of this world can possess functions
extending beyond it.

But this could be true only in case there were no phenomena of life and
of thought in the world, or if the phenomena of life and thought were
really *derivatives* from physical phenomena, and did not possess
infinitely greater latent force than they. Then only should we have the
right to consider the chains of phenomena in their physical or visible
sequence alone, as positivistic philosophy does. But taking into
consideration the phenomena of life and thought we shall inevitably
recognize that the chain of phenomena often translates itself from a
sequence purely physical to a biological sequence, i.e., one in which
there is much of the hidden and in-visible to us—or to a psychical
sequence where there is even more of the hidden; but during reverse
translations from biological and psychical spheres into physical
sequences actions proceed often, if not always, from regions which are
hidden from us; i.e., the cause of the visible is the invisible. In
consequence of this we must admit that it is impossible to consider the
chains of sequences in the world of physical phenomena only. When such a
sequence touches the life of a man or that of a human society, we
perceive clearly that it escapes from the "physical sphere" and returns
into it. Regarding the matter from this standpoint we see that, just as
in the life of one man and in the life of a society there are many
streams, at times appearing on the surface and spouting up in boisterous
torrents, and at other times disappearing deep underground, hidden from
view, but only waiting for their moment to appear again on the surface,
so do we observe in the world continuous chains of phenomena and we
perceive how these chains shift from one order of phenomena to another
without a break. We observe how the phenomena of consciousness—thoughts,
feelings, desires—are accompanied by

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

physiological phenomena—creating them perhaps—and inaugurate a series of
purely physical phenomena; and we see how physical phenomena, becoming
the object of sensations of sight, hearing, touch, smell and the like,
induce physiological phenomena, and then psychological. But looking at
life from that side, we see only physical phenomena, and having assured
ourselves that it is the only reality we may not notice the others at
all. Herein appears the enormous power of suggestion in current ideas.
To a sincere positivist any metaphysical argument proving the unreality
of matter or energy seems sophistry. It strikes him as a thing
unnecessary, disagreeable, hindering a logical train of thought, an
assault without aim or meaning on that which in his opinion is firmly
established, alone immutable, lying at the foundation of everything. He
vexedly fans away from himself all "idealistic" or "mystical" theories
as he would a buzzing mosquito.

But the fact is that *thought* and *energy* are different in substance
and cannot be *one and the same thing*, because they are different sides
of one and the same thing. For if we open the cranium of a living man in
order to observe all the vibrations of the cells of the gray matter of
the brain, and all the quivering white fibres, *in spite of everything
there will be merely motion*, i.e., the manifestation of energy, and
thought will remain somewhere beyond the limits of investigation,
retreating like a shadow at every approach. The "positivist," when he
begins to realize this, feels that the ground is quaking underneath his
feet, feels that by his method be will *never* approach to the
*thought*. Then he sees clearly the necessity for a new method. *As soon
as he begins to think about it* he begins quite unexpectedly to notice
things around him which he did not see before. His eyes begin to open to
that which he did not wish to see before. The walls which he had erected
around himself begin to fall one after another, and behind the falling
walls infinite horizons of *possible knowledge*, hitherto undreamed of,
unroll before him.

Thereupon he completely alters his view of everything surrounding him.
He understands that *the visible* is produced by *the invisible*; and
that without understanding the invisible it is impossible to understand
the visible. His "positivism" begins to totter and, if he is a man with
a bold thought, then in some splendid

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

moment he will perceive those things which he was wont to regard as real
and true to be unreal and false, and those things regarded as false to
be real and true.

First of all he will see that *manifested* physical phenomena often hide
themselves, like a stream that has gone underground. Yet they do not
disappear altogether, but continue to exist in latent form in some
minds, in someone's memory, in the words or books of someone, just as
the future harvest is latent in the seeds. And thereafter they again
burst into light; out of this latent state they come into an apparent
one, making a roar, reverberation, motion.

We observe such transitions of the invisible into the visible in the
personal life of man, in the life of peoples, and in the history of
humanity. These chains of events go on continuously, inter-weaving among
themselves, entering one into another, sometimes hidden from our eyes,
and sometimes visible.

I find an admirable description of this idea in the chapter on "Karma"
in *Light on the Path* by Mabel Collins. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

Consider with me that the individual existence is a rope which stretches
from the infinite to the infinite, and has no end and no commencement,
neither is it capable of being broken. This rope is formed of
innumerable fine threads, which, lying closely together, form its
thickness. . . . and remember that the threads are living—are like
electric wires; more, are like quivering nerves. . . .

But eventually the long strands, the living threads which in their
unbroken continuity form the individual, pass out of the shadow into the
shine. . . .

This illustration presents but a small portion—a single side of the
truth: it is less than a fragment. Yet dwell on it; by its aid you may
be led to perceive more. What it is necessary first to understand is not
that the future is formed by any separate acts of the present, but that
the whole of the future is in unbroken continuity with the present, as
the present is with the past. In the plane, from one point of view, the
illustration of the rope is correct.

The passages quoted show us that the idea of karma, developed in remote
antiquity by Hindu philosophy, embodies the idea of the unbroken
consecutiveness of phenomena. Each phenomenon, no matter how
insignificant, is a link of an infinite and unbroken chain,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

extending from *the past* into *the future*, passing from one sphere
into another, sometimes *manifesting* as physical phenomena, sometimes
*hiding* in the phenomena of consciousness.

If we regard karma from the standpoint of our theory of time and space
of many dimensions, then *the connection between distant events* will
cease to be wonderful and incomprehensible. If events most distant from
one another in relation to time *touch one another in the fourth
dimension*, this means that they are proceeding simultaneously as cause
and effect, and the walls dividing them are just an illusion which our
weak intellect cannot conquer. Things are united, not by time, but by an
inner connection, an inner correlation. And time cannot separate those
things which are inwardly near, following one from another. Certain
other properties of these things force us to think of them as being
separated by the ocean of time. But we know that this ocean does not
exist *in reality* and we begin to understand how and why the events of
one millennium can *directly* influence the events of another
millennium.

The hidden activity of events becomes comprehensible to us. We
understand that the events must become hidden in order to preserve for
us the illusion of time.

We know this—know that the events of today were the ideas and feelings
of yesterday—and that the events of tomorrow are lying in someone's
irritation, in someone's hunger, in someone's suffering, and possibly
still more in someone's imagination, in someone's fantasy, in someone's
dreams.

We know all this, yet nevertheless our "positive" science obstinately
seeks to establish correlations between visible phenomena only, i.e., to
regard each visible or physical phenomenon as the effect of some other
physical phenomenon *only*, which is also visible.

This tendency to regard everything upon one plane, the unwillingness to
recognize anything outside of that plane, horribly narrows our view of
life, prevents our grasping it in its entirety—and taken in conjunction
with the materialistic attempts to account for *the higher* as a
function of *the lower*, appears as the principal impediment to the
development of our knowledge, the chief cause of the dissatisfaction
with science, the complaints about the bankruptcy of science, and its
actual bankruptcy in many of its relations.

The dissatisfaction with science is perfectly well grounded, and the
complaints about its insolvency are entirely just, because science

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

has really entered a *cul de sac* out of which there is no escape, and
the official recognition of the fact that the direction it has taken is
entirely the wrong one, is only a question of time.

\_\_\_\_\_

We may say—not as an assumption, but as an affirmation—that the world of
physical phenomena in itself represents the section, as it were, of
another world, existing *right here*, and the events of which are
proceeding *right here*, but invisibly to us. There is nothing more
miraculous or supernatural than life. Consider the street of a great
city, in all its details. An enormous diversity of facts will result.
But how much is hidden underneath these facts of that which it is
impossible to see at all! What desires, passions, thoughts, greed,
covetousness; how much of suffering both petty and great; how much of
deceit, falsity; how much of lying; how many invisible
threads-sympathies, antipathies, interests—bind this street with the
entire world, with all the past and with all the future. If we realize
this imaginatively, then it will become clear that it is impossible to
study the street by *that which is visible* alone. It is necessary to
plunge into the depths. The complex and enormous phenomena of the street
will not reveal its infinite noumenon, which is bound up both with
eternity and with time, with the past and with the future, and with the
entire world.

Therefore we have a full right to regard the visible phenomenal world as
a section of some other infinitely more complex world, manifesting
itself at a given moment in the first one.

And this world of noumena is infinite and incomprehensible for us, just
as the three-dimensional world, in all its manifoldness of function, is
incomprehensible to the two-dimensional being. The nearest approach to
"truth" which is possible for a man is contained in the saying:
*everything has an infinite variety of meanings, and to know them all is
impossible*. In other words, "truth," as we understand it, i.e., *the
finite definition*, is possible only in a finite series of phenomena. In
an infinite series it will certainly become its own opposite.

Hegel has given utterance to this last thought: "Every idea, extended
into infinity, becomes its own opposite."

In this *change of meaning* is contained the cause of the
incomprehensibility

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

to man of the noumenal world. The substance of a thing, i.e., the
*thing-in-itself*, contains an infinite quantity of meanings and
functions of something which it is impossible to grasp with our mind.
And in addition to this it involves a change of meaning of one and the
same thing. In one meaning it represents an enormous whole, including
within itself a great number of things; in another meaning it is an
insignificant part of a great whole. Our mind cannot bind all this into
one; therefore, the substance of a thing recedes from us according to
the measure of our knowledge, just as a shadow flees before us. *Light
on the Path* says:

"*You will enter the light, but you will never touch the flame*."

This means, that *all knowledge* is relative. We can never grasp *all
the meanings* of any one thing, because in order to grasp them all, it
is necessary for us to grasp *the whole world*, with all the variety of
meanings contained in *it*.

The principal difference between the phenomenal and noumenal aspects of
the world is contained in the fact that the first one is *always
limited*, always finite; it includes those properties of a given thing
which we can generally know as *phenomena*: the second, or noumenal
aspect, is always unlimited, *always infinite*. And we can never say
where the hidden functions and the hidden meanings of a given thing end.
Properly speaking, they end nowhere. They may vary infinitely, i.e., may
seem various, ever new from some new standpoint, but they cannot utterly
vanish, any more than they can cease, come to an end.

*All that is highest* to which we shall come in the understanding of the
meaning, the significance, of *the soul* of any phenomenon, will *again*
have another meaning, from another, still higher standpoint, in still
broader generalization—*and there is no end to it!* In this is the
majesty and the horror of infinity.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Let us also remember that the world as we know it does not represent
anything stable. It must change with the slightest change in the foams
of our knowledge. Phenomena which appear to us as unrelated can be seen
by some other more inclusive consciousness as parts of a single whole.
Phenomena which appear to us as similar may reveal themselves as
entirely different. Phenomena which appear

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

to us as complete and indivisible, may be in reality exceedingly
complex, may include within themselves different elements, having
nothing in common. And all these together may be one whole in a category
quite incomprehensible to us. Therefore, beyond our view of things
another view is possible—a view, as it were, from another world, from
"*over there*," from "the other side."

Now "over there" does not mean some other place, but a new method of
knowledge, a new understanding. And should we regard phenomena not as
isolated, but bound together with inter-crossing chains of things and
events, we would begin to regard them not *from over here*, but from
*over there*.
