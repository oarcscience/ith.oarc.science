THE MEANING OF LIFE—this is the eternal theme of human meditation. All
philosophical systems, all religious teachings strive to find and give
to men the answer to this question. Some say that the meaning of life is
in service, in the surrender of self, in self-sacrifice, in the
sacrifice of everything, *even life itself*. Others declare that the
meaning of life is in the delight of it, relieved against "the
expectation of the final horror of death." Some say that the meaning of
life is perfection, and the creation of a better future *beyond the
grave*, or in future lives for ourselves. Others say that the meaning of
life is in the approach to *non-existence*: still others, that the
meaning of life is in the perfection of the race, in the organization of
life on earth; while there are those who deny the possibility of even
attempting to know its meaning.

The fault of all these explanations consists in the fact that they all
attempt to discover the meaning of life *outside of itself*, either in
the future of humanity, or in some problematical existence beyond the
grave, or again in the evolution of the *Ego* throughout many successive
incarnations—always in something *outside* of the present life of man.
But if instead of thus speculating about it, men would simply look
within themselves, then they would see that in reality the *meaning of
life* is not after all so obscure. IT CONSISTS IN KNOWLEDGE. All life,
through all its facts, events and incidents, excitements and
attractions, inevitably leads us TO THE

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> KNOWLEDGE OF
SOMETHING. All life-experience is KNOWLEDGE.

The most powerful emotion in man is his yearning toward the unknown.
EVEN IN LOVE, the most powerful of all attractions, to which everything
is sacrificed, is this yearning toward the unknown, toward the
NEW—*curiosity*.

The Persian poet-philosopher, Al-Ghazzali, says: "*The highest function
of man's soul is the perception of truth*." <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

In the very beginning of this book PSYCHIC LIFE and THE WORLD were
recognized as existing. The world is everything that exists. The
function of psychic life may be defined as *the realization of
existence*.

Man realizes his existence and the existence of the world, a part of
which he is. His relation to himself and to the world is called
knowledge. The expansion and deepening of his relation to himself and to
the world is the expansion of knowledge.

All the soul-properties of man, all the elements of his
psyche—sensations, perceptions, conceptions, ideas, judgments,
reasonings, feelings, emotions, even creation—all these are the
INSTRUMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE which the I possesses.

Feelings—from the simple emotions up to the most complex, such as
esthetic, religious and moral emotion—and creation, from the creation of
a savage making a stone hatchet for himself up to the creation of a
Beethoven, indeed are means of *knowledge*.

Only to our narrow HUMAN view do they appear to serve other purposes—the
preservation of life, the construction of something, or merely pleasure.
In reality all this *conduces* to knowledge..

Evolutionists, followers of Darwin, say that the struggle for existence
and the selection of the fittest created the mind and feeling of
contemporary man—that mind and feeling SERVE LIFE, preserve the life of
separate individuals and of the species—and that *beyond this* they have
no meaning in themselves. But it is possible to answer this with the
same arguments before advanced against the *mechanicality* of the
universe; namely, that if rationality exists, then nothing exists except
rationality. The struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest,
if they truly play such a rôle in the creation of life, are also not
merely accidents, but products of a mind, CONCERNING WHICH WE DO NOT
KNOW; and they also conduce, like everything else, TO A KNOWLEDGE.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

But we do not realize, do not discern the presence of rationality in the
phenomena and laws of nature. This happens because we study always not
the whole but the part, and we do not divine that whole which we wish to
study—by studying the little finger of a man we cannot discover his
reason. It is the same way in our relation to nature: we study always
the little finger of nature. When we come to realize this and shall
understand that EVERY LIFE IS THE MANIFESTATION OF A PART OF SOME WHOLE,
then only the possibility of knowledge of that whole opens to us.

In order to comprehend the rationality of a given whole, it is necessary
to understand the character of the whole and its functions. Thus the
function of man is knowledge; but without understanding "man" as a
whole, it is impossible to understand his function.

To understand our psyche, the function of which is knowledge, it is
necessary to clear up our relation to life.

In Chapter X an attempt was made—a very artificial one, founded upon the
analogy with a world of two-dimensional beings—to define *life* as
motion in a sphere higher in dimensionality in
[comparison](errata.htm#34.md) with ours. From this standpoint every
separate life is as it were the manifestation in our sphere of a part of
one of the rational entities of another sphere. These rationalities look
in upon us, as it were, in these lives which we see. When a man dies,
*one eye of the Universe closes*, says Fechner. Every separate human
life is a moment of the life of some *great being*, which lives in us.
The life of every separate tree is a moment of the life of a being,
"species" or "family." The rationalities of these higher beings do not
exist independently of these lower lives. They are two sides of one and
the same thing. Every *single* human psyche, in some other section of
the world, may produce the illusion of *many* lives.

This is difficult to illustrate by an example. But if we take Hinton's
spiral, passing through a plane, and the point running in circles on the
plane (see [70](to09.htm#img_fig02).md), and conceive of the spiral as the
psyche, then the moving point of intersection of the spiral with the
plane will be *life*. This example illustrates a possible relation
between the psyche and life.

To us, life and the psyche are different and separate from each other,
because we are inept at seeing, inept at looking at things.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And this in turn
depends upon the fact that it is very difficult for us to step outside
the frames of our *divisions*. We see the life of a tree, *of this
tree*; and if we are told that the life of a tree is a manifestation of
some psychic life, then we understand it in such a way that the life *of
this tree* is the manifestation of the psychic life of *this tree*. But
this is of course an absurdity resulting from "three-dimensional
thinking"—the "Euclidian" mind. The life of this tree is a manifestation
of the *psychic life of the species*, or family, or perhaps of the
psychic life of *the entire vegetable kingdom*.

In exactly the same way, our separate *lives* are manifestations of some
great rational entity. We find the proof of this in the fact that our
lives have no other meaning at all aside from that *process of acquiring
knowledge* performed by us. A thoughtful man ceases to feel painfully
the absence of meaning in life only when he realizes this, and begins to
strive consciously for that for which he strove unconsciously before.

This process of acquiring knowledge, representing *our function in the
world*, is performed not by the intellect only, but by our entire
organism, by all the body, by all the life, and by all the life of human
society, its organizations, its institutions, by all culture and all
civilization; by that which we know of humanity and, still more, by that
which we do not know. And we acquire the knowledge of that which we
deserve to know.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

If we declare in regard to the intellectual side of man that its purpose
is knowledge this will evoke no doubts. All agree that the human
intellect together with everything subjected to its functions is for the
purpose of knowledge—although often the faculty of knowledge is
considered as serving only utilitarian ends. But concerning the
emotions: joy, sorrow, rage, fear, love, hatred, pride, compassion,
jealousy; concerning the sense of beauty, esthetic pleasure and artistic
creation; concerning the moral sense; concerning all religious emotions:
faith, hope, veneration, etc., etc.,—concerning all human
activity—things are not so clear. We usually do not see that all
emotions, and *all* human activity serve knowledge. How do *fear*, or
*love*, or *work* serve knowledge? It seems

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

to us that by *emotions* we feel; by work—create. *Feeling* and
*creation* seem to us as something different from *knowledge*.
Concerning work, creative power, creation, we are rather inclined to
think that they *demand* knowledge, and if they serve it, do so only
indirectly. In the same way it is incomprehensible how *religious
emotions* serve knowledge.

Usually *the emotional* is opposed to *the intellectual*—"heart" to
"mind." Some place "cold reason" or [intellect](errata.htm#35.md) over
against feelings, emotions, esthetic pleasure; and from these they
separate the moral sense, the religious sense, and "spirituality."

The misunderstanding here lies in the interpretation of the words
*intellect* and *emotion*.

Between intellect and emotion there is no sharp distinction. Intellect,
considered as a whole, is also emotion. But in every-day language, and
in " conversational psychology" *reason* is contrasted with *feeling*;
*will* is considered as a separate and independent faculty; moralists
consider *moral feeling* as entirely distinct from all these;
religionists consider *spirituality* separately from *faith*.

One often hears such expressions as: reason mastered feeling; will
mastered desire; the sense of duty mastered passion; spirituality
mastered intellectuality; faith conquered reason. But all these are
merely the incorrect expressions of conversational psychology; just as
incorrect as are the expressions "sunrise" and "sunset." In reality in
the soul of man nothing exists save emotions. And the soul life of man
is either a struggle or a harmonious adjustment between different
emotions. Spinoza saw this quite clearly when he said that emotion can
be mastered only by another more powerful emotion, and by *nothing
else*. Reason, will, feeling, duty, faith, spirituality, mastering some
other emotion, can conquer only by force of the *emotional element*
contained in them. The ascetic who kills all desires and passions in
himself, kills them by the *desire* for salvation. A man renouncing all
the pleasures of the world, renounces them because of the delight of
sacrifice, of renunciation. A soldier dying at his post through his
*sense of duty* or habit of obedience, does so because the emotion of
*devotion*, or *faithfulness*, is more powerful in him than all other
things. A man whose moral sense prompts him to overcome passion in
himself, does so because the moral sense (i.e., emotion) is more
powerful than all his other feelings, other emotions. In substance

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

all this is perfectly clear and simple, but it has become confused and
confusing simply because men, calling different degrees of one and the
same thing by diverse names, began to see *fundamental differences*
where there were only *differences in degree*.

Will is the resultant of desires. We call that man *strong-willed* in
whom the *will* proceeds on definite lines, without turning aside; and
we call that man *weak-willed* in whom the line of the will takes a
zig-zag course, turning aside here or there under the influence of every
new desire. But this does not mean that *will* and *desire* are
something opposite; quite the reverse, they are one and the same,
because the will is composed of desires.

*Reason* cannot conquer feeling, because feeling can be conquered only
by feeling. Reason can only give thoughts and pictures, evoking feelings
*which* will conquer the feeling of a given moment. Spirituality is not
opposed to "intellectuality" or "emotionality." It is only THEIR HIGHER
FLIGHT. Reason has no limits: only the human, "Euclidian" mind, the mind
devoid of emotions, is limited.

But what is "reason?"

It is the inner aspect of any given being. In the earth's animal
kingdom, in all animals lower than man, we see *passive reason*. But
with the appearance of *concepts* it becomes active, and part of it
begins to work as intellect. The animal is conscious through his
sensation and emotions. The intellect is present in the animal only in
an embryonic state, as an *emotion of curiosity*, a pleasure of knowing.

In man the growth of consciousness consists in the growth of the
intellect and the accompanying growth of the higher emotions—esthetic,
religious, moral—which according to the measures of their growth become
more and more *intellectualized*, while simultaneously with this the
intellect is assimilating emotionality, ceasing to be "cold." .

Thus "spirituality" is a fusion of the intellect with the higher
emotions. The intellect is spiritualized from the emotions; the emotions
are *spiritualized* from the intellect.

The functions of the rational faculty are not limited, but not often
does the human intellect rise to its highest form. At the same time it
is incorrect to say that the highest form of human knowledge will not be
intellectual, but of a different character; only this higher

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

reason is entirely unrestricted by *logical concepts* and by Euclidian
modes of thought. We are likely to hear a great deal concerning this
from the standpoint of *mathematics*, which as a matter of fact
transcended the reasoning of logic long ago. But it achieved this *by
the aid of the intellect*. A new order of receptivity grows in the soil
of the intellect and of the higher emotions, but it is not created by
them. A tree grows in the earth, but it is not created by the earth. A
seed is necessary. This seed may be in the soul, or absent from it. When
it is there it can be cultivated or it can be choked; when it is not
there it is impossible to replace it with anything else. The soul (if a
soul it may be called) lacking that seed, i.e., inept to feel and
reflect the world of the wondrous, will never put forth the living
sprout, but will always reflect the phenomenal world, and that alone.

At the present stage of his development man comprehends many things by
means of his intellect, but at the same time, he comprehends many things
by means of his emotions. In no case are emotions merely organs of
feeling *for feeling's sake*: they are all organs of knowledge. In every
emotion man knows something that he could not know without its
aid—something that he could know by no other emotion, by no effort of
the intellect. If we consider the emotional nature of man as
self-contained, as serving *life* and not serving *knowledge* we shall
never understand its true content and significance. Emotions serve
knowledge. There are things and relations which can be known only
emotionally, and only through a given emotion.

To understand the psychology of *play*, it is necessary to experience
the emotions of the player; to understand the psychology of *the hunt*,
it is necessary to experience the emotions of the hunter; the psychology
of a man in love is incomprehensible to him who is indifferent; the
state of mind of Archimedes when he jumped out of the bath tub is
incomprehensible to the staid citizen, who would look on such a
performance as a sign of [insanity](errata.htm#36.md); the feelings of the
globe-trotter, delightedly breathing in the sea air and sweeping with
his eyes the wide horizon, is incomprehensible to the sedentary
stay-at-home. The feeling of a believer is incomprehensible to an
unbeliever, and to a believer the feeling of an unbeliever is quite as
strange. Men understand one another so imperfectly because they live
always by *different* emotions. And when they feel similar

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

emotions simultaneously, then and then only do they understand one
another. The proverbial philosophy of the people knows this very well:
"A FULL MAN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND A HUNGRY ONE," it says. "A drunkard is
no comrade for a sober man." "One rogue recognizes another."

In this mutual understanding or in the illusion of mutual
understanding—in this immersion in similar emotions—lies one of the
principal charms of love. The French novelist, de Maupassant, has
written very delightfully about this in his little story *Solitude*. The
same illusion explains the secret power of alcohol over the human soul,
for alcohol creates the illusion of *a communion of souls*, and induces
similar fantasies *simultaneously*, in two or several men.

Emotions are the stained-glass windows of the soul; colored glasses
through which the soul looks at the world. Each such glass assists in
finding in the contemplated object the same or similar colors, but it
also prevents the finding of opposite ones. Therefore it has been
correctly said that a one-sided emotional illumination cannot give a
correct perception of an object. Nothing gives one such a clear idea of
things as the emotions, yet nothing deludes one so much.

Every emotion has a meaning for its existence, although its value from
the standpoint of knowledge varies. Certain emotions are important and
necessary for the life of knowledge and certain emotions hinder rather
than help one to understand.

Theoretically all emotions are an aid to knowledge; all emotions arose
*because* of the knowing of one or another thing. Let us consider one of
the most elementary emotions—say THE EMOTION OF FEAR. Undoubtedly there
are relations which can be known *only through fear*. The man who never
experienced the sensation of fear will never understand many things in
life and in nature; he will never understand many of the controlling
motives in the life of man. (What else but the fear of hunger and cold
forces the majority of men to work?) He will never understand many
things in the animal world. For example, he will not understand the
relation of mammals to reptiles. A snake excites a feeling of repulsion
and fear in all mammals. By this *repulsion* and *fear* the mammal knows
the nature of the snake and the relation of that nature to its own, and
knows it correctly, but *strictly personally*,

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

and only from its own standpoint. But what the snake is in itself the
animal never knows by the emotion of fear. What the snake is *in
itself*—not in the philosophical meaning of the *thing-in-itself* (nor
from the standpoint of the man or animal whom it has bitten or may bite)
but simply from the standpoint of zoölogy—THIS CAN BE KNOWN BY THE
INTELLECT ONLY.

Emotions unite with the different I's of our psyche. Emotions apparently
the same may be united with the very small I's and with the very great
and lofty I's; and so the rôle and meaning of such emotions in life may
be very different. The continual shifting of emotions, each of which
calls itself I and strives to establish power over man, is the chief
obstacle to the establishment of a *constant* I. And particularly does
this interfere when the emotions are manifesting in and passing through
the regions of the psyche connected with a certain kind of
self-consciousness and self-assertion. These are the so-called *personal
emotions*.

The sign of the growth of the emotions is the liberation of them from
the personal element, and their sublimation on the higher planes. The
liberation from personal elements augments the cognizing power of the
emotions, because the more there are of pseudo-personal elements in
emotion the greater the possibility of delusion. Personal emotion is
always *partial*, always *unjust*, by reason of the one fact that it
opposes *itself* to all the rest.

Thus the cognitive power of the emotions is greater in proportion as
there is less of *self-elements* in a given emotion, i.e., more
consciousness that this emotion is not the I.

We have seen before in studying *space* and its laws, that the evolution
of knowledge consists in a gradual withdrawing from oneself. Hinton
expresses this very well. He says that only by *withdrawing from
ourselves* do we begin to comprehend the world as it is. The entire
system of mental exercises with colored cubes invented by Hinton aims at
the training of consciousness to look at things from other than the
pseudo-personal standpoint.

<span class="small">When we study a block of cubes, writes Hinton, (say
a cube consisting of 27 lesser cubes) we first of all learn it by
starting from a particular cube and axis, and learning how 26 others
come with regard to that cube. . . . We learn the block with regard to
this axis, so that we can mentally conceive the disposition of every
cube as it comes regarded from one point of view. Next we suppose
ourselves to be in another</span>

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

cube at the extremity of another axis; and looking from this axis, we
learn the aspect of all the cubes, and so on.

Thus we impress on the feelings what the block of cubes is like from
every axis. In this way we get a knowledge of the block of cubes.

Now, to get the knowledge of humanity, we must study it from the
standpoint of the individuals composing it.

The egotist may be compared with the man who knows a cube from one
standpoint only.

Those who feel superficially with a great many people, are like those
learners who have a slight acquaintance with a block of cubes from many
points of view.

Those who have a few deep attachments are like those who know them well
from only one or two points of view.

And after all, perhaps the difference between the good and the rest of
us, lies rather in the former *being aware*. There is something outside
them which draws them to it, which they see, while we *do not*. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md)

Just as it is incorrect in relation to oneself to evaluate everything
from the standpoint of one *emotion*, contrasting it with all the rest,
so is it correspondingly incorrect in relation to the world and men to
evaluate everything from the standpoint of one's own accidental I,
contrasting oneself of a given moment with the rest.

Thus the problem of correct emotional knowledge consists in the fact
that one shall *feel* in relation to the world and men *from some
standpoint other than the personal*. And the broader the circle becomes
for which a person feels, the deeper becomes the knowledge which his
emotions yield. But not all emotions are of equal potency in liberating
from *self-elements*. Certain emotions from their very nature are
*disruptive*, separative, alienating, forcing man to feel himself as
individualized and separate; such are hatred, fear, jealousy, pride,
envy. These are emotions of a *materialistic order*, forcing a belief in
matter. And there are emotions which are *unitive*, harmonizing, making
man feel himself to be a part of some great whole; such are love,
sympathy, friendship, compassion, love of country, love of nature, love
of humanity. These emotions lead man out of the material world and show
him the truth of the world of the wondrous. Emotions of this character
liberate him more easily from self-elements than those of the former
class. Nevertheless there can be a quite *impersonal* pride—the pride in
an heroic deed accomplished by *another man*. There can even be

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

*impersonal* envy, when we envy a man who has conquered himself,
conquered his *personal* desire to live, sacrificed himself for that
which everyone considers to be right and just, but which we cannot bring
ourselves to do, cannot even think of doing, *because of weakness, of
love of life*. There can be impersonal hatred—of injustice, of brute
force, anger against stupidity, dullness; aversion to nastiness, to
hypocrisy. These feelings undoubtedly elevate and purify the soul of man
and help him to see things which he would not otherwise see.

Christ driving the money-changers out of the temple, or expressing his
opinion about the Pharisees, was not entirely meek and mild; and there
are cases wherein meekness and mildness are not virtues at all. Emotions
of love, sympathy, pity transform themselves very readily into
sentimentality, into weakness; and thus transformed they contribute of
course to *nescience*, i.e., *matter*. The difficulty of dividing
emotions into categories is increased by the fact that all emotions of
the higher order, without exception, can also be personal and then their
action partakes of the nature of this class.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

There is a division of emotions into *pure* and *impure*. We all know
this, we all use these words, but understand little of what they mean.
Truly, what does "pure" or "impure" mean with reference to feeling?

Common morality divides, a priori, all emotions into pure and impure
according to certain outward signs, just as Noah divided the animals in
his ark. All "fleshly desires" fall into the category of the "impure."
In reality indeed, "fleshly desires" are just as pure as is everything
in nature. Nevertheless emotions are pure and impure. We know very well
that there is truth in this classification. But where is it, and what
does it mean?

Only an analysis of emotions from the standpoint of knowledge can give
the key to this.

Impure emotion—this is quite the same thing as impure glass, impure
water, or impure sound, i.e., emotion which is *not* pure, but
containing sediments, deposits, or echoes of other emotions:
IMPURE—MIXED. Impure emotion gives obscure, *not pure* knowledge,

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

just as impure glass gives a confused image. Pure emotion gives a clear
pure image of that for the knowledge of which it is intended.

This is the only possible decision of the question. The arrival at this
conclusion saves us from the common mistake of moralists who divide
arbitrarily all emotion into "moral" and "immoral." But if we try for a
moment to separate emotions from their usual moral frames, then we see
that matters are considerably simpler, that there are no *in their
nature* pure emotions, nor impure *in their nature*, but that each
emotion will be pure or impure according to whether or not there are
admixtures of other emotions in it.

There can be a pure sensuality, the sensuality of the *Song of Songs*,
which initiates into the sensation of cosmic life and gives the power to
hear the beating pulse of nature. And there can be an impure sensuality,
mixed with other emotions good or bad from a moral standpoint but
equally making muddy the fundamental feeling.

There can be pure sympathy, and there can be sympathy mixed with
calculation to receive something for one's sympathy. There can be pure
love of knowledge, a thirst for knowledge for its own sake, and there
can be an inclination to knowledge wherein considerations of *utility*
or *profit* assume the chief importance.

In their outer manifestation pure and impure emotions may differ very
little. Two men may be playing chess, acting outwardly very similarly,
but in one will burn self-love, desire of victory, and he will be full
of different unpleasant feelings toward his rival—fear, envy of a clever
move, spite, jealousy, animosity, or schemes to win, while the other
will simply solve a complex mathematical problem which lies before him,
not thinking about his rival at all.

The emotion of the first man will be impure, if only because it contains
much of the mixed. The emotion of the second will be pure. The meaning
of this is of course perfectly clear.

Examples of a similar division of outwardly similar emotions may be
constantly seen in the esthetic, literary, scientific, public and even
the spiritual and religious activities of men. In all regions of this
activity only complete victory over the pseudo-personal elements leads a
man to the correct understanding of the world and of himself. All
emotions colored by such SELF-ELEMENTS

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

are like concave, convex, or otherwise curved glasses which refract rays
incorrectly and distort the image of the world.

Therefore the problem of emotional knowledge consists in a corresponding
preparation of the emotions which serve as organs of knowledge.

In these evangelical words is expressed first of all the idea of the
purification of the emotions. It is impossible to know through impure
emotions. Therefore in the interests of a correct understanding of the
world and of the self, man should undertake the purification and the
elevation of his emotions.

This last leads to an entirely new view of *morality*. That morality the
aim of which is to establish a system of correct relations toward the
emotions, and to assist in their purification and elevation, ceases in
our eyes to be some wearisome and self-limiting exercise in virtue.
Morality—this is a form of esthetics.

That which is *not moral* is first of all not beautiful, because not
concordant, not harmonious.

We see all the enormous meaning that morality may have in our life; we
see the meaning morality has *for knowledge*, for the reason that there
are emotions *by which we know*, and there are *emotions* by which we
delude ourselves. If morality can actually help us to analyze these,
then its value is indisputable from the standpoint of knowledge.

Current popular psychology knows very well that malice, hatred, anger,
jealousy BLIND a man, DARKEN his reason; it knows that fear DRIVES ONE
INSANE, etc., etc.

But we also know that *every emotion* may serve either knowledge or
nescience.

Let us consider such an emotion—valuable and capable of high
development—as *the pleasure of activity*. This emotion is a powerful
motive force in culture, and of service in the perfection of life and in
the evolution of all higher faculties of man. But it is also the cause
of an infinite number of his delusions and *faux pas* for which he
afterwards pays bitterly. In the passion of activity man is easily
inclined to forget the *aim* that started him to act; to accept

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the activity itself for the aim and even to *sacrifice the aim* in order
to preserve the activity. This is seen with especial clearness in the
activity of various spiritual movements. Man, starting out in one
direction, turns in the opposite one without himself noticing it, and
often descends into the abyss thinking that he is scaling the heights.

There is nothing more contradictory, more paradoxical than the man *who
is enticed away by activity*. We have become so accustomed to "man" that
the strange perversions to which he is sometimes subject fail to startle
us as curiosities.

Violence in the name of freedom; violence in the name of love; the
Gospel of Christianity with sword in hand; the stakes of the Inquisition
for the glory of a God of Mercy; the oppression of thought and speech on
the part of the ministers of *religion*—all these are incarnated
absurdities of which humanity only is capable.

A correct understanding of *morality* can preserve us in some degree
from such perversions of thought. In our life in general there is not
much morality. European culture has gone along the path of intellectual
development. The intellect invented and organized without considering
the moral meaning of its own activity. Out of this arose the paradox
that the crown of European culture is the "dreadnaught."

Many people realize all this, and on account of it assume a negative
attitude to all culture. But this is unjust. European culture created
much other than dreadnaughts that is new and valuable, facilitating
life. The elaboration of the *principles* of freedom and right; the
abolition of slavery (though these are indeed nominal); the victory of
man in many regions where nature presented to him a hostile front; the
methods for the distribution of thought, the press; the miracles of
contemporary medicine and surgery—all these are indisputably real
conquests, and it is impossible not to take them into consideration.
*But there is no morality in them*, i.e., there is no truth but too much
of falsehood. We are satisfied with mere principles as such; we are
content to think that eventually they will be introduced into life, and
we neither marvel nor are disturbed at the thought that we ourselves
(i.e., cultured humanity), developing beautiful principles, continually
deny and controvert them in our lives. The man of European culture
invents with equal readiness a machine gun and

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

a new surgical apparatus. European culture began from the life of the
savage, taking this life as an example as it were and starting to
develop *all its sides* to the uttermost without thinking of their moral
aspects. The savage crushed the head of his enemy with a simple club. We
invented for this purpose complicated devices, making possible the
crushing of hundreds and thousands of heads at once. Therefore such a
thing as this happened: aerial [navigation](errata.htm#37.md), toward which
men had looked forward for millenniums, finally achieved, is used first
of all for purposes of war.

*Morality* should be the co-ordination and the necessity for the
co-ordination of all sides of life, i.e., of the actions of man and
humanity with the higher emotions and the higher comprehensions of the
intellect. From this point of view the statement previously made, that
morality is a form of esthetics, becomes clear. Esthetics—the sense of
beauty—is the *sensation* of the relation of parts to a whole, and the
perception of the necessity for a certain harmonious relation. And
morality is the same. Those actions, thoughts and feelings are not moral
which are not coördinated, which are not harmonious with the higher
understanding and the higher sensations accessible to man. The
introduction of morality into our life would make it less paradoxical,
less contradictory, more logical and—most important—more *civilized*;
because now our vaunted civilization is much compromised by
"dreadnaughts," i.e., war and everything that goes with it, as well as
many things of "peaceful" life such as the death penalty, prisons, etc.

Morality, or moral esthetics in such a sense as is here shown, is
necessary to us. Without it we too easily forget that the *word* has
after all a certain relation to the act. We are interested in many
things, we enter into many things, but for some strange reason we fail
to note the incongruity between our spiritual life and our life on
earth. Thus we create two lives. In one we are preternaturally strict
with ourselves, analyze with great care every idea before we discuss it;
in the other we permit with extreme ease any compromises, and easily
keep from seeing that which we do not care to see. Moreover, we
reconcile ourselves to this division. We do not find it necessary
seriously to introduce into our lives our higher ideals, and almost
accept as a principle the division of the "real" from the "spiritual."
All of the indecencies of our life have arisen as a result of this; all
of those infinite falsifications

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

of our life—falsifications of the press, art, drama, science,
politics—falsifications in which we suffocate as in a fetid swamp, but
which we ourselves create, because we and none other are servants and
ministers of those falsifications. We have no sense of the *necessity*
to introduce our ideals into life, to introduce them into *our daily
activity*, and we even admit the possibility that this activity may go
counter to our spiritual quests, in accordance with one of those
established standards the harm of which we recognize, but for which no
one holds himself responsible because he did not create them himself. We
have no *sense of personal responsibility*, no boldness, and we are even
without the consciousness of their necessity. All this would be very sad
and hopeless if the concept "we" were not so dubious. In reality, the
correctness of the very expression "we" is subject to grave doubt. The
enormous majority of the population of this globe is engaged in effect
in destroying, disfiguring, and falsifying the ideas of the minority.
The majority is without ideas. It is incapable of understanding the
ideas of the minority, and left to itself it must inevitably disfigure
and destroy. Imagine a menagerie full of monkeys. In this menagerie a
man is working. The monkeys observe his movements and try to imitate him
but they can imitate only his visible movements; the meaning and aim of
these movements are closed to them; therefore their actions will have
quite another result. And should the monkeys escape from their cages and
get hold of the man's tools, then perhaps they will destroy all his
work, and inflict great damage on themselves as well. But they will
never be able to create anything. Therefore *a man* would make a great
mistake if he referred to their "work," and spoke of them as "we."
Creation and destruction—or more correctly, the ability to create or the
ability *only* to destroy—are the principal signs of the two types of
men.

Morality is necessary to "man": only by regarding everything from the
standpoint of morality is it possible to differentiate unmistakably the
work of man from the activity of apes. But at the same time delusions
are nowhere more easily created than in the region of morality. Allured
by *his own particular morality* and moral gospel, a man forgets the
*aim* of moral perfection, forgets that this aim consists in knowledge.
He begins to see an aim in *morality itself*. Then occurs the a priori
division of the emotions

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

into good and bad, "moral" and "immoral." The correct understanding of
the aim and meaning of the emotions is lost along with this. Man is
charmed with his "niceness." He desires that everyone else should be
just as nice as he, or as that remote ideal created by himself. Then
appears delight in morality for morality's sake, a sort of moral
sport—the exercise of morality for morality's sake. A man under these
circumstances begins to be afraid of everything. Everywhere, in all
manifestations of life, something "immoral" begins to appear to him,
threatening to dethrone him or others from that height to which they
have risen or may rise. This develops a preternaturally suspicious
attitude toward the morality of others. In an ardor of proselytism,
desiring to popularize his moral views, he begins quite definitely to
regard everything which is not in accord with his morality as hostile to
it. All this becomes "black" in his eyes. Starting with the idea of
utter freedom, by arguments, by compromises, he very easily convinces
himself that it is necessary to fight freedom. He already begins to
admit a censure of thought. The free expression of opinions contrary to
his own seems to him inadmissible. All this may be done with the best
intentions, but the results of it are very well known.

There is no tyranny more ferocious than the tyranny of morality.
Everything is sacrificed to it. And of course there is nothing so blind
as such tyranny, as such "morality."

Nevertheless humanity needs morality, but of a different kind—such as is
founded on the *real* data of superior knowledge. Humanity is
passionately seeking for this, and perhaps will find it. Then on the
basis of this *new morality* will occur a great division, and those few
who will be able to follow it will begin to rule others, or they will
disappear altogether. In any case, because of this new morality and
those forces which it will engender, the contradictions of life will
disappear, and those biped animals which constitute the majority of
humanity will have no opportunity to pose as men any longer.

The organized forms of intellectual knowledge are: *science*, founded
upon observation, calculation and experience; and *philosophy*,

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

founded upon the speculative method of reasoning and drawing
conclusions.

The organized forms of emotional knowledge are: *religion* and *art*.
Religious teachings, taking on the character of different "cults" as
they depart from the original "revelation," are founded entirely upon
the emotional nature of man. Magnificent temples, the gorgeous vestments
of priests and acolytes, the solemn ritual of worship, processions,
sacrifices, singing, music, dances—all these have as their aim the
attuning of man in a certain way, the evoking in him of certain definite
feelings. The same purpose is served by religious myths, legends,
stories of the lives of heroes and saints, prophecies, apocalypses—they
all act upon the imagination, upon the feelings, although they fail to
fulfil their original purpose, which is to transmit ideas, i.e., to
serve knowledge.

The aim of it is to give *God* to man, to give him morality, i.e., to
give him an accessible knowledge of the mysterious side of the world.
Religion may deviate from its true aim, may serve *earthly* interests
and purposes, but its foundation is the search for truth, for God.

Art serves *beauty*, i.e., emotional knowledge of its own kind. Art
discovers beauty in everything, and compels man to feel it and therefore
*to know*. Art is a powerful instrument of knowledge of the noumenal
world: mysterious depths, each one more amazing than the last, open to
the vision of man when he holds in his hands this magical key. But let
him *only think* that this mystery is not for knowledge but for pleasure
in it, and all the charm disappears at once. Just as soon as art begins
to take delight in that beauty which is already *found*, instead of *the
search for new beauty* an arrestment occurs and art becomes a
superfluous estheticism, encompassing man's vision like a wall. The aim
of art is *the search for beauty*, just as the aim of religion is the
search for God and truth. And exactly as art stops, so religion stops
also as soon as it ceases to search for God and truth, thinking it has
found them. This idea is expressed in the precept: *Seek . . . the
kingdom of God and his righteousness*. . . . It does not say, find; but
merely, seek!

Science, philosophy, religion and art are forms of knowledge. The method
of science is experiment; the method of philosophy is speculation; the
method of religion and art is moral or esthetic *emotional* inspiration.
But both science and philosophy, religion and art, begin to serve *true
knowledge* only when in them commence to manifest the sensing and
finding of some inner property in things. In general it is quite
possible to say—and perhaps it will be most true to fact—that the aim of
even purely intellectual systems of philosophy and science consists not
at all in the giving to man of certain data of knowledge, but in the
raising of man to such a height of thinking and feeling as to enable him
to pass to those new and higher forms of knowledge to which art and
religion approach more nearly. It is necessary however to remember that
these very divisions into science, philosophy, religion and art betray
the poverty and incompleteness of each. A complete religion unites in
itself religion, art, philosophy and science; a complete art equally
unites them, while a complete science or a complete philosophy
comprehends religion and art. A religion which contradicts science, and
a science which contradicts religion are both equally false.
