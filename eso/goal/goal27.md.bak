### CHAPTER XXII.

#### EXIT FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW.

#### PART II.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the chapter on "The Image and the
Likeness" we have portrayed the high plane designed by the Divine
Purpose for the people at the closing cycle of the Christian era. Many
after reading this work will say in themselves: This is too far beyond
me. I can never attain it. Then why was it written?—For the same reason
that God caused to be written in the very beginning of our Bible, the
account of the garden of Eden where man walked and talked with God as
with a friend.

It is always necessary that there be an object and an ultimate set
before the mind of man to strive for, and when the object is well
defined, then there may be also well-defined methods for attaining that
object. Even though that object be very high, yet who can limit the
power of the human mind, much less, who can limit the power of God to
lead and to help man to high attainments?

It will be seen in the Everlasting Covenant—the

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ten
Commandments—that God pledges his name to be our power, and if we have
God's power to help us, is there anything impossible to us?—Certainly
not. The only thing that will hinder any one from attaining this
ultimate is lack of faith in God. But you may ask: Who can have that
perfect faith in God? As these apparent obstacles rise up before you, an
absolute criterion to enable you to judge whether or not you can attain
is required. There is such a criterion, and it is this:

After reading these thoughts, if you have an earnest desire to attain
this ultimate, then by Divine Authority we say that you can attain it,
but if you have not this desire, then you do not belong to the first
ripe fruit of the earth, for the words of our Great Master are, "He that
will, let him take the water of life freely." If we look at these words
from the standpoint of human experience, we shall say, then everybody
can attain. But this is not so. It is only those who *will*. Who are
those who are *able* to will?—Jesus answered this question by saying,
"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance:
but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he
hath." That there is an interior meaning to these words is evident on
the face; for how can that be taken away from a man which he has not?
The interior meaning or, if you please, the law of *psychology*
governing here is this:

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

No man can have the *will* to do that which is not in him to do. In
other words, man is possessed of a physical nature and of a spiritual
nature. The ripening of the human ego, called the "ripe fruit," means
the maturing of the spiritual ego to where it is able to take control of
the body and to cause the body to obey the will of this spiritual ego.

Many there are who, when these thoughts are brought before them, will
find within them an active desire to attain the ultimate, but they will
also find another desire stronger than their desire for this attainment,
which will so fully overwhelm their desire for this attainment that
their desire will not amount to a decision in favor of a higher life,
but on the contrary the decision will be to continue living in the old
channels and relations.

This is to say, when these divine truths are brought to the
consciousness of the individual "he that hath"—developed the spiritual
qualities to where they have gained the predominance, the
ascendency—will have the <span class="smallcaps">will</span> to do and
to decide that he will live this life and will strive to attain this
high ultimate. On the other hand, there will be those who will say: It
would be very nice to attain it, but we are of the earth and we have too
many interests to leave them. Thus they will not have enough of the
spiritual qualities to cause them to will to make the effort to attain.
For it must be borne in mind that <span class="smallcaps">will</span> is
that function of the

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

mind that executes the decisions after all has been weighed and
balanced. Then the office of the will is executive—doing and
accomplishing, but guided by the intellect. Therefore it is plain that
to will is to be practical. It means not merely to believe or to desire,
but to do something.

Thus we understand the parable of our Lord, "Whosoever hath \[enough of
spirit to control his actions\], to him shall be given, and he shall
have abundant: but whosoever hath not \[enough to cause him to decide in
favor of the spiritual life\], from him shall be taken away even that
which he hath," namely, all spiritual desire and spiritual
consciousness.

Therefore this fact is presented to you: That whoever desires to attain
and can make the decision to do the very best he knows and leave the
rest with God, *can* attain and *will* attain—provided that decision is
not afterward reversed.

During the centuries that the Christian religion has been the religion
of the Occident, "conversion" has been the line between the Christian
and the non-Christian. We find from reading the experiences of the
apostles given in Acts, Romans and Corinthians, that in their time
conversion was called "receiving the Holy Ghost."

In modern times revivalists have found in order that a man be converted
he must accept Jesus as his Savior; he must in a way enter into covenant
with God, make a solemn promise that he will

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

thenceforth live the Christian life as far as he is able. As soon as the
soul within him unites with the intellect in this covenant, he receives
the Holy Spirit that gives him a consciousness of his acceptance with
God.

We wish to emphasize the thought, that the reception of the Holy
Spirit—the consciousness of the *acceptance* with God—is dependent upon
man's *covenant* with God, which is simply man's promise that thereafter
he will make it the chief object of his life to "seek first the kingdom
of God and his righteousness."

Every converted soul that has made this covenant has been illuminated by
the Spirit, perhaps but for a short time. But just so far as the person
keeps his part of the covenant and follows carefully the leading of the
Spirit, doing as nearly right as he knows (for it is the office of the
Spirit to cause him to know what is right and what is not), so far will
he be led, given knowledge, his mind illuminated on various subjects
and, as Jesus promised, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, will lead him
into all truth and show him things to come.

If the one receiving this Holy Spirit that is received at the time of
conversion, is absolutely obedient to it, it will lead him into a
complete and perfect knowledge of the truth. Here the question arises:
How is it that so much error has crept into the church in regard to the
general beliefs of the people?—The answer to this question is: Instead
of

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

following the leadings of the Spirit, the people have accepted leaders
among men and have followed their dictum, even to the crushing out of
the higher and holier impressions given by the Spirit. True, many
thought that they were doing right and, therefore, they have not been
condemned, only so far as they have jeopardized themselves by error and
by an imperfect life, and have shut the door against God's Spirit so
that it could not illuminate the mind and fulfil its mission—to lead
them into all truth.

Why has this been permitted?—There are two reasons: First, as we have
hitherto shown, it is in the line of the Divine Purpose that man shall
have freedom of choice, within the limits of his own qualities and
inherent ability, in order that he may grow into the Divine Likeness.
Second, it is in the order of the Divine Purpose that generation, labor,
sorrow, and death shall continue until man can grow and develop to a
state where he is able to overcome generation and to enter into life.
The Lord Christ said, "He that is able to receive it, let him receive
it." Who is able?—The first ripe fruit of the earth; they that have
developed to where they have a desire sufficient to make the decision, a
*will* to seek first and all the time "the kingdom of God and his
righteousness," and to make every other consideration of every name and
nature subject to this one purpose—these, and these only are able to
receive it.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

There is at the present time a great Body of people who have received
the Holy Spirit, who have been begotten from above, but who have been
misled through the education of our age, and as we look into the
churches and among men, probably we feel as did Elijah, for after he had
brought down fire to consume the sacrifice and even the water that was
poured upon .it, and he thought that he had restored the true worship to
Israel, he was forced to flee for his life, and he made complaint to God
and said: "The children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown
down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I
only am left; and they seek my life to take it away," but God assured
him that there were still seven thousand in Israel, "All the knees which
have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him."
And at this time, according to the Revelation made to John, God has
reserved not seven thousand, but 144,000, yea, 288,000 souls. Are *you*
one of that company?—You may be if you <span
class="smallcaps">will</span>.

Some years ago after long years of isolation from the world and
continued devotion to know and to do the will of the Father, we felt an
earnest desire to give the truths that the Lord had given us to his
people; but every effort to give the truth to the so-called advanced
thinkers was rejected, and after one of those rebuffs our soul
exclaimed: O God, where are thy people?—Instantly the answer came.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Lord gave us a
vision of the world on which the sunlight was shining. The people were
rushing hither and thither, each one intent on his own interests; but in
the midst of the sunlight there appeared dark, obscure places; and as
the Spirit bade us peer into those places, we saw there hidden away a
few souls upon whom shone a whiter light than the sunlight, and the Lord
said: These are my people.

At another time it was shown us that God's people as a Body were still
in the church, for what the Lord begins to do, he will certainly
accomplish. You who have been begotten of the Spirit, have that in you
which can will to follow the Lord wholly. You can, if you will, now make
a new covenant with God, for, in the language of Jeremiah xxxi. 31, the
time has come for the Lord to make a new covenant with you and with the
house of Israel. Will you take that covenant? Will you now promise to do
God's will just as nearly as you know? Remember God's part of the
covenant is to be your power, and if God is your power, as we said
before, nothing can thwart you. Remember too that that power is not a
physical power, but God by mind created the world, and the manifestation
of God's power is in the mind.

Therefore it is God's part of the covenant to make you know the right,
and if you are faithful to do the will as perfectly as you know, then
you certainly will be led by that Divine Consciousness.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In other words, if
you make this covenant with God, <span class="smallcaps">Yahveh</span>
Elohim, who loves you with a love transcending your imagination, will
send to you an angel from his holy presence, whose business it will be
to be with you and to watch over you, to instruct and to lead and to
help you to do and to accomplish.

But says one: "I have made that covenant, but I am not conscious of the
angels of God; true, sometimes I feel an illumination and a peace and a
joy, but I do not know of any angel-guidance." No, truly you do not
know. And if you knew for a surety that there is a conscious personality
with you, whose business it is to lead and to guide you, it would be
very human for you at once to cease to use your own mind, to cease to
make efforts from yourself and to expect this angel to do all your work
for you. And if you have any overcoming of the appetites, passions or of
the dark forces, you will be indolent, and expect this angel to overcome
for you.

Remember that the words of God are, "He that overcometh shall inherit
all these things." Therefore when God's angel is sent to guide and to
help you, he will not make himself known to you, but he will illuminate
your mind and cause you to know the right; and there will be times when
the angel will stimulate your will to do and to accomplish, and then you
must use all the powers within you to do and to accomplish—to be the
overcomer.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

The difference between the manifestation of the angels of God that are
sent to his people, and the manifestation of the spirits of darkness
that come to the spiritualistic medium is very marked. The spirits of
darkness demand absolute obedience, they demand the surrender of your
highest intellect, of your mental conclusions; they demand absolute
obedience regardless of your own ideas of morality and right; they also
make themselves known and many times claim to be a beloved relative that
has passed over; whoever you love most they will personify. They try to
make you believe that they are the angels of God sent to guide you, but
they are lying spirits.

Remember God's angels cannot be called upon to do this or that for you.
Your mind must be centered on God, on the Father Almighty, Maker of
heaven and earth, <span class="smallcaps">Yahveh</span> Elohim, and as
your mind is centered on God—the highest that you can imagine—if you
want help, you do not call upon the angel that is sent to guide you, but
you call upon God and as the angel is God's messenger, if you have
confidence in God and you are doing all in your power, then it is the
angel's office to add sufficient power to you to enable you to
accomplish. In other words, in place of coming to you as a personality,
God's angel will even prevent you from seeing him or from knowing of his
presence, but many times he will draw so near to you that he will simply
unite his consciousness, his mental power,

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

to yours and for the moment you know as he knows, you feel as he feels,
you perceive the situation as clearly as he perceives it.

Mark you, the angel does not tell you that thus and so is true—only the
dark spirits tell you such things. The angel of God causes you to know
for yourself, then he leaves you and you feel as if you had been dropped
from a high pinnacle; but you have the knowledge that he has imparted to
you, and it is for you, yourself, to use that knowledge to do and to
accomplish and to discriminate between right and wrong, good and evil,
truth and error. You will then realize that *good* is that which *aids*
you to work in accordance with the Divine Purpose, and *evil* is that
which *hinders* you from working in accordance with that purpose.

The standards of good and evil that have been set up in the world by men
must be carefully examined and perhaps some of them laid aside, for, as
we have shown in the first part of this work, we are judged according to
our beliefs and our own soul condemns or justifies us in the proportion
that we act in accordance with our beliefs. Therefore at this point it
will be necessary for you to put your whole mind on God and to desire
wisdom that will enable you to discriminate between good and evil, and
in order that the Spirit may reveal to you what is good and what is
evil.

Here is a delicate point. It is only through great devotion, through
earnest prayer, and a careful

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

life that you will be enabled to set the right standards and to remove
the errors. Your soul must be free from established beliefs, beliefs
that were established during the dark period of man's existence, for the
angel of the Lord has now been sent to you to lead you out from the *old
order into the new*. That which was moral and just and righteous under
the *old order of life* has now passed away; the standards of
righteousness have advanced to higher planes.

However, the standards established by the Lord Christ in that noted
Sermon on the Mount are not changed; not one of the standards of the
Lord Christ's life is changed. Only the standards that you and your
predecessors have set up will be torn down, and they are now being torn
down. Having covenanted your life to God that you may become one of the
first ripe fruit of the earth, you are going through the process of
harvesting, of being cut down, separated from the ground; you no longer
live from the earth, but you live from God. As the Master said, "If ye
abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatsoever ye will, and it
shall be done unto you." This abiding in him was further brought to
light in that noted prayer recorded in John xvii:

"Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me
through their word; that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art
in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us."

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

You are seeking that oneness, and even now you have attained it, so far
as you can believe it, provided you have fulfilled the foregoing
requirements. At this point again read carefully the Sermon on the
Mount, for from this standard God is able to make *you* keep and will
make you able to keep all the statutes, the ordinances, that Christ has
laid down in this wonderful sermon.

Remember that there are not many things for you to keep in mind, but
there are very few. You have decided to do the will of God as perfectly
as you know it, and if you believe God, as he has promised to make you
know his will and has sent his angel to you for that purpose, you need
not be anxious for anything but to do his will.

Keep ever in view your *purpose*, make everything yield to the
accomplishing of that *purpose*, then all things will work together for
your good, for you are called now of God according to his purpose.
(Romans viii. 28.)

So far we think that we have made the way plain before you. We have
shown you how to free yourself from the bondage that hinders you from
going forward, and we have shown you how to place yourself in the hands
of God whose power is unlimited, and who is able to make you know and
give you power to do his will. Henceforth look no more to man. Look no
longer to books. Desire to know only such truths as you need to enable
you to accomplish the Divine Purpose.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

If you keep your eye on that inner consciousness—for remember God speaks
in the soul, though he sometimes illuminates the brain—then when the
impression comes to read the Scriptures or any book, read it carefully,
musingly and prayerfully. Always keep your inner eye upon God; never let
it change, then whatever you read, the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, that
has promised to lead you into all truth, will illuminate your mind, will
enable you to discern between truth and error, so that you cannot be
deceived.

When we say you cannot be deceived, it all depends upon your having
covenanted your life to God, upon your keeping your mind unselfishly
centered upon the Spirit, desiring nothing so much as to know and to do
the will. *When this desire is the absolute, controlling thought of your
mind, nothing can deceive you*. But remember, if you set up an idol in
your heart (see Ezekiel xiv.), if you desire something for yourself, it
matters not *what*, and then look to God in the spirit of devotion, you
will find that the Spirit of God will not respond to you; and if you
persist in living the life in order that you may accomplish something
for yourself, accomplish some purpose that you have set up in your
heart, which is your idol, then evil spirits will come to you,
apparently granting your desire, but taking possession of your soul, and
your last state will be worse than the first.

What has been said in this chapter is preparatory

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

to placing you in the hands of the Father, where you will have no more
absolute need that will not be supplied by the Spirit; but remember that
supply may often come to you through physical means, or through the
mentality of other persons. But you cannot set up the idol in your heart
as to how the things that you need shall come. God may use some low,
even malicious, person to teach you some great and grand truth. Remember
always that it is the knowledge that you want, not the messenger.

If God sends an important message to you by the hand of a devil what
concern is it to you? It is the message that you want. It is the
knowledge that is useful to you, and if a messenger comes with knowledge
that is not useful, that is not in harmony with the Divine Purpose, no
matter if the messenger claims to be the angel of God, no matter if he
comes in a flame of fire, reject the message. Believe God and follow
righteousness and all will be well. For, if you have lived the life up
to this point, God will have fulfilled his part of the covenant, and you
will realize that you have the spirit of truth and you will be able to
discern between truth and error. Just so long as you are faithful to
your part of the covenant, faithful in your devotion to God and Spirit,
so long can you absolutely trust that Spirit of truth that will lead you
into all truth, and enable you to

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

reject all error, and will many times even show you things to come.

The teachers in the church are ever warning their people against error,
and frequently warning them against great and important truths as error,
because the teachers do not believe God. But if you believe God, and
trust him wholly, your eye will ever be single to the knowledge of the
truth; not because you want this, that, or the other, but because you
want only to know and to do the will. Then you will know within
yourself. It will not be a belief, but God will make you know the truth.
But after you have been made to know the truth, if through fear or
through any means whatever, you fail to follow it, to be led by it, then
will the Spirit leave you to go your own way until you repent and seek
God with all your heart again, and find that peace and confidence which
enable you to be obedient to the knowledge of the truth; then you will
be made conscious again that you have the guidance of the Spirit.
