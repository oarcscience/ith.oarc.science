### PREFACE.

Our excuse for offering this book to the world in a time when books have
become a drug on the market, will be found in the following: In the
history of Christianity we believe that knowledge of God and of the
Christ has never been so vague and uncertain as at present. There is in
the intuitive mind, a consciousness that there is something which if
known would put in order and harmonize the *revelation* of the Spirit
and the faith of the Christ with *science*. This consciousness on the
part of the many, is a hunger and an outreaching of the soul for some
one to *put in order*, in a brief and concise form, the great truths
that have been obscured by the beliefs of the world for all the ages
past. This we have tried to do.

If we have been able to present to the mind of the thinker, *first*, a
reasonable idea of God, *second*, if we have been able to remove a
vague, uncertain mystery that shrouds man's relation to God and to bring
him face to face with something that he can take hold of tangibly—not
with his devotional nature only, but with his reason and with the
ordinary consciousness—then we shall feel that we have accomplished
much.

Our effort herein has been to expand the conception of God, the
conception of the universe, and of the immensity of all that is; and to
show that in this immensity

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

there is found a unity, in this unity a mind that has a purpose, and
that this mind has in it all power and is therefore ruling absolutely,
as the vitality and potentiality of all that is, therefore the purpose
in this mind—the object for which all things exist—is being carried out
with absolute certainty, nothing being able to resist it, for all *life*
upon this planet is as a drop taken from the great ocean of life and
must ever remain subject to the law of its Source.

We have herein brought to light the fact that the great work that is
being carried on by the Infinite Mind—his ultimate object—is to form
mind-centers to be acted upon and through, in the control and government
of the world, and that these mind-centers are to be manifested in the
individualized manhood of our race, brought to light in the Revelation
as the first ripe fruit of the earth, who are to be kings and priests
unto God and to reign on the earth.

We have brought to light also the fact that, becoming kings and priests
unto God and reigning on the earth, is placed at man's disposal, and
that there are methods as old as creation by which man may lay hold upon
these universal laws and become master of them and by the knowledge of
these laws become the king of the whole earth, the embodiment of the
mind and will of the planet, the expressor of the mind of God in the
governing of all creation below him.

Finally, it has been our purpose to bring to light that which has been a
mystery to the world—the Christ, who and what he is, and his mission.

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

If we succeed in this, our purpose, we shall, we believe, reveal the
mystery of all religion, the key to all scientific knowledge, and shall
unveil the mystery of life and the means by which men may conquer death
and thus be saved and become the saviors of the people from the cause of
their suffering and death.
