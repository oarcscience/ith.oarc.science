### UNITY

**I SEE NO EVIL**

I see no evil; I behold only the good.  
I have seen the drunkard lying in the gutter, and the saint kneeling in
ecstasy before the high altar of his faith; but I have found no
difference.  
I have perceived that each, in his own tongue, is seeking to express the
One Life.  
I will not separate and divide; I cannot condemn nor censure, for I know
that there is but One in All.  
I know that all came from the One, and all will return to the One.  
I know that all are now in the One, and that each is seeking to express
the One.

*I know and love all*.

 

**I SHALL NEVER DIE**

I shall never die, for the Spirit within me is God and cannot change.

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

My life is hid within the Universe of Love and Light, and that Light
shall live forever.  
Go, fear of death and change; begone from my thought, fear of death and
uncertainty.  
That which is cannot become that which is not; and that which I am can
never change.  
The Spirit of Eternity is enthroned within me, and the Life of Endless
Ages flows through my being.  
From Eternity to Eternity my Life flows along its way of peace and
harmony.  
Time brings but more glory to crown me with its pleasures.

*My life is forever*.

 

**LOVE TO THE WORLD**

My Love goes out to everyone in the world;  
I do not exclude anything, for I love all Nature and everything that
is.  
My Love warms and lightens everything that it touches, and it goes out
into all places.  
The Love flowing through me is a Power to all who come into contact with
it, and all feel and know that I love.  
Love within me is Complete and Perfect.

*Love within me is Complete*.

 

**MY LIFE IS ONE WITH GOD**

My life is in God; it cannot be hurt nor hindered in its expression.  
God lives and expresses through me; His work is complete and perfect in
me now.

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

I know His life to be my life, and I know that my life is complete and
perfect.

*My Life is in God*.

 

**NO MISUNDERSTANDINGS**

There are no misunderstandings.  
All is made clear between the ideas of Good.  
No false sense of separation can come between people, nor disturb the
realization of the Unity of All Life.  
I perceive that I am one with all people, and all are One with me.  
There is no separation.

*There is no separation*.

 

**THE DIVINE PLAN FOR ME**

The Divine Plan for me is Perfect. I am held in the Mind of God as a
Complete and Perfect Expression of Life and Truth.  
No power can hinder nor mar this Inner Image of Reality, for It is
God-given and God-kept.

*God gave and God will keep*.

 

**THE PERSONALITY OF GOD**

The Great Personality of God is my Personality; the Limitless
Knowingness of The Spirit is my Knowingness, and the One Mind is my
mind.  
All, All live in One Infinite Person, and each manifests the One Who is
formed through and in all.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

Man is the Personality of God in manifestation and cannot be left
without the Inner Witness of the Spirit.  
I now realize that the Infinite Personalness of the Spirit is my
Personality, and I rejoice to know the Truth about myself.

*God is my Personality*.

 

**THE RADIATION OF LIFE**

The life of God within me radiates and shines forth from me in a
constant stream of Light to all.  
The One Life flowing through me is Life to all who come near.  
The One Power operating through me is flowing into everything that I
contact.

*Life radiates from me*.

 

**UNITY**

To-day I realize that I am One with the All Good; my God and I are
One.  
I cannot be hid from His face.  
I behold Thee, O Most High, enthroned in my temple of flesh.  
Thy secret place is within me. I feel Thy presence,  
I hear Thy voice, I rejoice in Thy Light.  
To-day my body responds to the Divine Behest: "Be perfect."  
I know of my perfection and wholeness; I am complete and perfect now.  
Let every thought of disease flee from me, and let Thy Light shine.  
O Light Eternal, O Light of my Life, I come into Thy presence with joy
and thanksgiving.

*So be it*.

 

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

**WITHIN THEE IS FULNESS OF LIFE**

Within Thee is fulness of Life.  
Within Thee is complete Joy and everlasting Peace.  
Within Thee is all.  
Thou art in me as I am in Thee, and we are all in all.  
My Life is full and complete within me, and that Life I give to all men
freely;  
And from all I receive again that which I have given,

For it is One in All.

*I am One with the fulness of All Life*.
