### THE MEANING OF THE FALL

The story of the fall typifies race-experience as brought about through
its belief in duality. Man is created perfect; that is, he starts on his

would have no real meaning unless it were backed by the power to
externalize this choice and experience

the effect of it. Man has the ability to choose and to externalize his
choice; for he is a real individuality.
