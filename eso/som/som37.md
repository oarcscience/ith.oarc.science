The Science of Mind, by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes \[1926\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

### MAN'S CREATIVE POWER MARVELOUS

Man's creative power in his world is marvelous; for every time he thinks
he sets the Law in motion. As his thought sets the Law in motion it is
specializing It for some definite purpose; and in this way his word
becomes the law unto the thing which he speaks. Of course man never
really creates, but his use of Creative Power makes his word creative
through the Medium of Mind. This should give to all a sense of freedom
and a realization that there is neither competition nor monopoly. It
leaves each to work out his own salvation, not with fear or even
trembling, but with a calm sense of peace and assurance.
