### THE SUPREME AFFIRMATION

Strange as it may seem, the human thought can affirm only; it can never
deny; for, even at the moment of denial, it really affirms the presence
of that which it denies.

We speak of denials and affirmations as though they were opposed to each
other, but such is not the case. Fear and faith are but different ways
of expressing positive beliefs about something. Fear is a positive
belief that we will experience something that we do not wish to have
happen, while faith is a positive belief that we will experience
something that we do wish to have happen.

The nature of Being is such that real denial is impossible; for there is
but One Mind in the Universe, and It is always "yea and amen."

We are constantly affirming our way through life; and since affirmation
is the only mental action possible, it behooves us to find the greatest
affirmation and use it.

The Supreme Affirmation is, "I AM"; and, as such, It was given to Moses.
This affirmation is constantly with us, and every time we speak we use
it in some form. We must be careful to use it only as an upbuilding
force.
