### INSPIRATION

**A SONG OF JOY**

There is a Song upon my lips to-day; it sings of the glad heart and the
happy ways of Life.  
I will listen to my song, for it carols to me the glad tidings of Great
Joy, of Love and Life.

It tells me of the Wondrous Journey of the Soul and the Boundless Life
in which my life is hid.

*I am filled with joy*.

 

**BORN OF ETERNAL DAY**

Child of All Good, you are born of Eternal Day.  
There is no evening of the Soul, for it shall live forever.  
It is Deathless and Perfect, Complete and One with the Everlasting.  
No thought of to-morrow can disturb the calm of him who knows that Life
is one Eternal Day.  
No fear can enter where Love reigns, and Reason keeps faith with Hope.  
The thoughts of the to-morrows and the yesterdays are swallowed up in
the great realization of the Perfect Here and the Complete Now.

*To-day I completely accept my wholeness*.

**I ARISE AND GO FORTH**

I arise and go forth into the Dawn of the New Day, filled with faith and
assurance in the All Good.  
I arise, I arise, I sing with joy!  
I proclaim the One Life: "In all and through all."  
I arise, I arise, I shout with gladness that is within me.  
I declare this day to be Complete, Perfect and Eternal.

*I respond to Life*.

 

**INSPIRATION**

Come, Thou Great and Infinite Mind and inspire me to do great deeds.  
Acquaint me with Thy knowledge and in Thy wisdom make me wise.  
I would be taught of Thee, Inner Light, and inspired by Thy presence.  
I will listen for Thy Voice and it will tell me of great things to be
done.  
I will walk in Thy Paths and they will lead me into All Good.  
I will be inspired from On High.  
O Wonderful Presence, flooding me, filling me with Thy Light,  
Thou dost inspire me!

*I feel the inspiration of Spirit*.

 

**THE DAWN HAS COME**

Out of the darkness of the long night the Dawn has come.  
I rise to meet the new day, filled with confidence and strength.  
I arise and go forth into the dawn, inspired and refreshed by the Living
Spirit within me.  
O Day, you shall never die; the sun shall never set upon your perfect
glory.

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

For the Lamp of the Soul has been re-kindled with the oil of Faith,  
And Love has cleansed the windows of Life with the spirit of gladness.  
They shall nevermore grow dim with fear, for Perfect Love casteth out
all fear.  
I am renewed in strength through knowing Good.

*My light has come*.

 

**I AM COMPLETE IN THEE**

Almighty God, Everlasting Good, Eternal Spirit, Maker of all things and
Keeper of my Life, Thou art All.  
Infinite Presence within, in Whom all live; Joy Supreme, flooding all
with gladness, I adore Thee.  
Eternal Peace, undisturbed and quiet, I feel Thy calm.  
O Thou Who dost inhabit Eternity and dost dwell within all Creation, Who
Dost live through all things and in all people, hear Thou my prayer.  
I would enter Thy gates with joy and live at peace in Thy House.  
I would find a resting place in Thee, and in Thy presence live.  
Make me to do Thy will and from Thy wisdom teach me the ways of Truth.  
Compel me to follow Thee and let me not pursue the paths of my own
counsel.  
O Eternal and Blessed Presence, illumine my mind and command my will
that my Soul may be refreshed and that my live may be renewed.  
As deep cries unto deep, so my thought cries unto Thee and Thou dost
answer.  
I am renewed and refreshed; my whole being responds to Thy love, and I
am complete in Thee.  
All my ways are guarded and guided, and I shall live with Thee
eternally.

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

O Lover of my Soul and Keeper of my Spirit, none can separate us, for we
are One.  
So shall Thy Wisdom guide me, Thy Presence dwell within me, Thy Love
keep me and Thy life envelop me now and forevermore.

*I rest in Thee*.
