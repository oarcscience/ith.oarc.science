### THE CALL

This I saw, or else some inner presence made it known to me;  
The Universe is filled with life; the air, the sky, the sea  
Teem with intelligence, with majesty and might;  
And deep within me, some subtle inner sight  
Beholds and sees, comprehends and knows the All,  
Nor fears nor falters, but answers the Divine Call  
To be as one beyond the bounds of time and space,  
To overcome the bondage of the human race,  
And leap, with trust undaunted, free,  
Into the deeps of that Infinite Sea  
Whose waters, calm, are ready to receive  
Those, who in simple faith, believe.
