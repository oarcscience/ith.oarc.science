# *Part II:* The Lessons

## Lesson One: Introduction

In presenting these lessons in Mental Science to the public, it is my
desire to make it possible for any one, who cares to take the time to
study them, to demonstrate the truths that will be discussed. It is,
perhaps, hard to set down in writing a complete teaching in Mental
Science that will not appear difficult to understand; but this could be
said as well of any science, and the Science of Mind is no exception to
the general rule.

**SCIENCE**

Science is knowledge of facts built around some proven principle. All
that we know about any science is that certain things happen under
certain conditions. Take electricity as an example; we know that there
is such a thing as electricity; we have never seen it, but we know that
it exists because we can use it; we know that it operates in a certain
way and we have discovered the way it works. From this knowledge we go
ahead and deduce certain facts about electricity; and, applying them to
the general principle, we receive definite results. No one has ever seen
the power or the energy that we call electricity; and the only proof we
have that it really exists is that from it we receive light, heat and
motive power.

No one has ever seen any of the great causes that lie back of the
manifestations of life, and perhaps no one ever will; but we know that
such principles exist because we can use them.

**HOW LAWS ARE DISCOVERED**

The discovery of a law is generally made more or less by accident, or by
some one who, after careful thought and observation, has come to the
conclusion that such a principle

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

must exist. As soon as a law is discovered experiments are made with it,
certain facts are proved to be true, and in this way a science is
gradually formulated; for any science consists of the number of known
facts about any given principle. As more and more facts are gathered and
proven, the science expands and gradually becomes accepted by all and
used by those who understand it. In this way all of our sciences have
been evolved until to-day we have the use of powers and unseen forces of
which our ancestors never even dreamed.

**PROOF OF MIND**

This is true of the Science of Mind. No one has ever seen Mind or
Spirit, but who could possibly doubt their existence? Nothing is more
self-evident than that we live; and since we live, we must have life;
yet who has ever seen this life? The only proof of life we have is that
we live; and the only proof we have of Mind is that we can think; so we
are perfectly justified in believing that we have a mind and that we
live.

**WHERE OUR THOUGHTS GO**

As we watch the processes of thought we find that we think consciously,
and we also find that something happens to our thoughts after we have
thought them; for instance, they become memory. This proves that we have
a deeper aspect of mind, which is called subjective, lying just below
the threshold of the conscious. This subjective mind is the place where
our thoughts go and from whence they eventually return to us again as
memory. Observation proves this to be true; for it always happens this
way.

Observation has proven that the subjective mind is the seat of memory
and that it contains mental pictures, or impressions, of all that has
ever happened to the individual. As these mental impressions come to the
surface of the conscious mind they are called memories.

Moreover observation has shown that the subjective mind is the builder
of the body. It has proven that it is not only the seat of memory; it is
also the avenue through which Instinctive

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Man works. We mean
by Instinctive Man that part of the individual which came with him when
he was born--that inner something which makes him what he is. For
instance, we do not have to consciously think to make the body function;
so we say that the inner, or the Instinctive, Man, does this for us.
This is true of most of the functions of the body; they appear to be
automatic; they came with us and are nature's way of working through us.
So we say that in the unconscious or the sub-conscious or the
subjective, there is a silent process forever working away and always
doing its duty, carrying on all of the unconscious activities of the
body without effort on our part.

**SUGGESTION BECOMES MEMORY**

It has been observed that suggestions, planted in the subconscious,
become memories, and eventually tend to externalize in the body. From
this it has been deduced that the sub-conscious mind is the builder of
the body and is the creative factor in man. It has also been proven that
certain types of thought produce certain kinds of results. This shows
that the subjective mind takes our suggestions and tends to act upon
them, no matter what the suggestion may be.

While the Instinctive Man, or the Natural Man, must be perfect, it is
known that the thoughts of the conscious man may hinder instinctive
action, through adverse suggestion. That is, conscious thought, acting
as memory, may build a false condition in the body, which condition we
call disease. Conscious thought may also erase this memory and thereby
heal the disease.

Through observations such as these, a science of the subjective mind has
gradually been formulated, many facts have been put together; and,
to-day, these facts constitute what we call the science of the
subjective life in its relationship to mental healing.

**MENTAL MEDIUM THROUGH ALL**

It has also been proven that thought operates in such a manner as to
make it possible to convey mental impressions

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

from one person to another, showing that there is a mental medium
between all people. When we think of it, how could we talk with each
other unless there were some kind of a medium through which we talked?
We could not; and so we know that there really is such a medium. While
there is a place where our bodies begin and leave off, as form, there
does not appear to be a place where our thought leaves off. Indeed, the
observations made and the facts gathered show that the medium between
men's minds is omnipresent; that is, it seems to be everywhere present.
Radio also shows this, for messages are sent out through some kind of a
universal medium, and all that we can say of it is that we know the
medium is there. So it is with Mind; all that we can say is that
everything happens just as though it were there. We have a perfect
right, then, to say that such a medium exists.

This opens up a far-reaching theory, for it leads to the conclusion that
we are surrounded by a Universal Mind which is the Medium of the
communication of our thoughts. Perhaps this is the Mind of God! Who
knows? That It is there, we cannot doubt.

**READING THOUGHT**

Other observations have shown even more wonderful possibilities. It is
known that certain people can read our thoughts, even when we are not
aware of the fact, showing that thought operates through a medium which
is universal, or always present. This also shows that the medium is
subjective; for it retains our thoughts and transmits them to others.
This leads to the conclusion that what we call our subjective mind is
really the use that we, as individuals, make of something which is
universal. Perhaps, just as radio messages are operative through a
universal medium, our thoughts are operative through the medium of a
Universal Mind. Indeed, this has been believed for thousands of years by
some of the deepest thinkers.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

**MENTAL LAW**

As we think of the medium of radio transmission in terms of law, so we
should think of the Mental Medium in terms of law; for it must be the
law of mental action. While we might think of it as the Mind of God, we
surely could not think of it as the Spirit of God; for the Mental Medium
is automatic, while the Spirit must be Self-Knowing. We could not call
the Universal Medium of Mind God, any more than we could call
electricity God. It is but one of the many attributes of God or the
Universe of Life. It is the avenue through which God operates as Law.

**THE WORD OF GOD AS LAW**

Since man has a self-conscious mind, a subconscious mind and a body, we
know that he is threefold in his nature. First, he is conscious mind or
spirit; next, he is subconscious mind or mental law; and then, he is
body. The conscious mind controls the subconscious; and in its turn, the
subconscious controls the body.

It is evident that man comes from God, Life or Nature, whichever we
choose to call It. It is also evident that we can get from Life only
that which is in It. Man must partake of the Divine Nature if he comes
from It or is made out of It; for what is true of the Whole must also be
true of any of Its parts. Something cannot come from nothing; something
must come from something; for nothing comes from nothing and nothing is
the result; but man is something, else he could not declare himself; and
since he is something, he must be made from, or come out of, something;
and that something must be what we call God.

**THREEFOLD NATURE OF GOD**

If we study the true nature of man, then, we shall have delved into the
real nature of God, or First Cause, from which man springs; and as we
have found that man is threefold in his nature, so we must also deduce
that God is threefold in His

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature; that is,
God is Spirit, or Self-Knowingness; God is Law and action; and God is
Result or Body. This is the inner meaning of the teaching of "the
Trinity." But let us elaborate: God, as Self-Knowing Spirit, means the
Divine Being Whom we have always thought of and believed in; the Being
to Whom we have prayed and Whom we have adored. God, as Law, means the
way in which the Spirit works; and Law in this sense, would be the
servant of the Spirit. God, as Body, means the manifestation of the
Spirit. We might put it in another form and say, there is the Thing, the
way that It works and the result of Its work. Still another form would
be to say, Cause, Medium and Effect.

**TRINITY OF BEING**

A trinity of being appears to run through all Nature and all Life; for
instance, there is electricity, the way it works and its result, which
is light or motive power. There is the seed, the creative medium of the
soil and the plant. Turn it as we may, we are confronted with the
necessity of a trinity of being. There must always be the thing, what it
does and the way that it operates. Always a trinity runs through life
and through everything in it. But through the Trinity of God and man
there runs a Self-Conscious Spirit, and this is what distinguishes man
from the brute, or from a purely mechanical creation; and is the only
thing that could make God a Self-Knowing Power.

**CONSCIOUS MIND IN GOD AND MAN**

In God and in man there is a power that, while it may not transcend law,
yet consciously uses it for definite purposes. In God this knowledge
must be complete, but in man it is, of course, but dimly perceived.
Jesus, the wisest Man who ever lived, said that God and man are One in
real nature, and no doubt this understanding was what gave Him His
marvelous power.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

**UNITY**

It is well to remember that the enlightened in every age have taught
that back of all things there is One Unseen Cause: In studying the
teachings of the great thinkers we find that a common thread runs
through all--the thread of Unity. There is no record of any deep
thinker, of any age, who taught duality. One of the great teachings of
Moses was, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One Lord"; <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and the saying, "I AM that I AM," <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) was old when Moses was yet unborn; for it
had been inscribed over the temple entrances for generations. We may go
back much farther than Moses and find the same teaching, for it crops
out from the literatures and sayings of the wise of all ages. Jesus
taught this when He said, "I and the Father are One," <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) and in the saying, "The Father that dwelleth
in me." <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

This teaching of Unity is the chief cornerstone of the Sacred Scriptures
of the East as well as of our own Sacred Writings. It is to-day the
mainspring of the teachings of the modern philosophies, such as
Christian Science, Divine Science, The Unity Teachings, The New Thought
Movement, The Occult Teachings, The Esoteric or Inner Teachings, and
even of much that is taught under the name of Psychology. Without this
basic teaching of Unity these movements would have but little to offer.
Science has found nothing to contradict this teaching, and it never
will, for the teaching is self-evident.

**WORSHIP OF GOD**

That there is a God or First Cause no one can doubt. That the Being Whom
we call God really exists from eternity to eternity is self-evident. In
every age people have worshipped some kind of Deity. It is true that as
the evolution of man has progressed the idea of God has expanded, and
the more that people have realized of life, and of nature and her laws,
the clearer has been the concept of Deity, for this is the logical
result of an unfolding mentality.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

**MANY GODS**

The first stages of human thought brought out the idea that there were
many gods, the natural outcome of a life which experienced many kinds of
misfortune and difficulties. As there were many gods so there were many
devils or evil powers; but as the understanding of man grew he began to
realize that there could not be so many powers, since the Cause back of
everything must be a Unity, else It could not exist. More than one power
would indicate a universe divided against itself, and this kind of a
universe could not hold together. However, it has taken a long time to
come to this conclusion, and in the stages between many weird ideas have
been formulated and believed in. At first there were many gods and many
devils; but as thought progressed, this was narrowed down to One God and
one devil or evil power. Duality has been believed in since time
immemorial, and, indeed, is still believed in by many. By duality we
mean a belief in more than One Power back of all things.

**BELIEF IN DUALITY--ITS RESULTS**

The belief in duality has robbed theology of power and has polluted
philosophy with untruths; it has divided science against itself and has
made countless thousands go through life with saddened hearts.

**DUALITY IN THEOLOGY**

The belief in duality has given rise in theology to the idea of a God
and a devil, each with equal power to impose upon man a blessing or a
curse, and men have worshiped a devil just as truly as they ever
worshiped God. Even to-day this monstrous thought is robbing men of
their birthright to happiness and a sense of security. Even to-day, and
openly, men still teach that there is an evil power in the universe,
that there is damnation to the souls of those who do not fall down and
worship--they know not what. But the time is rapidly coming when such
teachings will be thrown on the scrap heap

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

and numbered among the delusions of a frantic mentality. It has been the
habit of many religious teachers of all times to hold the crowd in awe
before a mighty throne of condemnation and utter destruction, till the
poor, ignorant population have rent the air with their lamentations of
complete despair. This, indeed, was a good method to compel the
attention with the hope of salvation through some sacred rites to be
performed by those whom God had appointed. In justice to such an awful
performance, we would better give to these religious teachers the
benefit of the doubt and say that they themselves have believed in the
atrocious teachings which they have so unhesitatingly given out.

Be this as it may, the time has now come for a clearer understanding of
the true nature of the Deity, in Whom we all believe, and Whom we all
seek to know and to understand. That there is a God no sane person would
deny; that there could be a God of vengeance and hate, having all the
characteristics of a huge man in a terrible rage, no person can well
believe and keep his sanity. We will say, then, and without mincing
matters in the least, that the most we had better believe about such a
God is that there is no such being.

**DUALITY IN PHILOSOPHY**

As the belief in duality has robbed theology of its greater message, so
it has robbed much of the philosophy of the ages of a greater truth; for
in philosophy the belief in duality has created a confusion that is
almost as great as that in theology. It has made a philosophy of good
and evil in which men have come to believe. True philosophy in every
age, however, has perceived that the Power back of all things must be
One Power; and the clearer the thought of Unity, the greater has been
the philosophy. It has shone forth as a beacon light toward which weary
souls have traveled, hoping to find reality. To the great philosophers
of all times we owe the advancement of the world; for they have been the
great way-showers and helpers of mankind. In reverence, we humbly bow
before them as Messengers of the Most High; for God has spoken through
their lips and has told us that we are not creatures

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of the dust but that we are Divine Beings, made in the image of
Perfection and with an endless destiny.

**DUALITY AND SCIENCE**

The belief in duality has robbed science, in that it has created Spirit
and matter; i.e., a dual universe. However, modern science is rapidly
giving out a different idea of the universe; for with the passing of
matter into a hypothetical and theoretical ether there is but little
left on which to hang any belief in materialism. We now are told that
all matter is in a constant state of flow; that it all comes from one
source; and that it will eventually return to that source.

**AN AWAKENING**

The world is waking up to the fact that things are not at all what they
appear to be; that matter and form are but the one substance appearing
and disappearing; and that form is simply used to express something
which is formless, but self-conscious life. What this life is, science
does not attempt to explain. This has been left to theology, and whether
or not it has been delegated to those competent to handle the problem
time alone will tell.

**PHILOSOPHY LEADS MAN'S THOUGHT**

Philosophy has always transcended science and always will; for
philosophy deals with causes while science deals with effects. A
scientist observes the result of nature's work while a philosopher
speculates as to its cause. Many things which philosophy has taught for
thousands of years are to-day being demonstrated by science. The two
should really go hand in hand; for one deals with causes and the other
with effects. True philosophy and true science will some day meet on a
common basis; and, working together, will give to the world a theology
of reality. Then, indeed, will "God go forth anew into Creation."

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

**A DEEP INQUIRY**

The deep thinkers of antiquity as well as the philosophers of all ages
have meditated long and earnestly on the nature of the Divine Being.
Knowing that there could be but One Ultimate Reality back of all things,
they have pondered deeply upon the nature of that Reality; and it is a
significant fact that all of the greatest thinkers have come to about
the same conclusion.

**THE GREAT DIFFICULTY**

The difficulty that has beset the path of true philosophy has been the
necessity of explaining a multiplied Creation with a Unitary Cause.
Nothing is more evident than that we live in a world of constant change.
Things and forms come and go continuously; forms appear only to
disappear; things happen only to stop happening; and it is no wonder
that the average person, unused to trying to discover causes, is led to
feel and to believe that there is a multiple cause back of the world of
things.

The philosophers of all times have had to meet the difficulty of
explaining how One Cause could manifest Itself in a multiplicity of
forms without dividing or breaking up the One. This has not been easy,
yet, when understood, the explanation becomes very apparent.

**THE VOICE OF GOD IN CREATION**

The argument has been something after this manner: The Ultimate Cause
back of all things must be One, since Life cannot be divided against
Itself; the Infinite must be One, for there could not be two Infinites.
Whatever change takes place must take place within the One; but the One
must be Changeless; for, being One and Only, It cannot change into
anything but Itself. All seeming change, then, is really only the play
of Life upon Itself; and all that happens must happen by and through It.
How do these things happen through It? By some inner action upon Itself.
What would be the nature of this

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

inner action? It could not be physical, as we understand physics, but
would have to be by the power of the inner Word of Life; that is, the
Voice of God, God standing for the First great and Only Cause of all
that Is.

**THE WORD OF GOD**

It is impossible to conceive of anything other than the Word of God
being that which sets power in motion. This is why the Scriptures
announce that, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God
and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was
not anything made that was made." <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) God
speaks and it is done.

It is evident that First Cause must be Self-Existent; that is, It must
be Causeless. Nothing came before That Which was First; and, while it
may be a little hard to understand this, yet we can all grasp the fact
that whatever the Being is Whom we call God, It must be Self-Existent.

**SPIRIT KNOWS ITSELF**

God speaks and it is done; but if God speaks, His Word must be Law. The
Word of God is also the Law of God. God is Word, God is Law and God is
Spirit; this is self-evident. We arrive at the conclusion that God, as
Spirit, is Self-Conscious Life. That Spirit is conscious is proven by
the fact that we have evidence of this consciousness strewn through all
time and space. God must know that God Is. This is the inner meaning of
the teaching of the "I AM," handed down from antiquity. "The Spirit is
the Power that knows Itself," is one of the oldest sayings of time.

**LAW, SERVANT OF THE WORD**

Spirit knows Itself, but the Law is the servant of the Spirit and is set
in motion through Its Word. It is known that all law is some form of
universal force or energy. Law does not know itself; law only knows to
do; it is, therefore, the servant

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

of the Spirit. It is the way that the Spirit works; and is the medium
through which It operates to fulfill Its purpose.

Did God make law? As it is not possible to conceive a time when law did
not operate, it is impossible to conceive that it was ever created;
therefore, law must be coexistent and coeternal with Spirit. We might
say that law is one of the attributes of Spirit.

The Spirit operated through law which is some part of Its own Nature;
therefore, all action must be some action of Spirit as Law. The Word of
Spirit sets Its purposes in motion through the law; and since the law
must be as Infinite as the Spirit, we could not think of a time when it
was not, or a time when it would cease to be; neither can we imagine the
law ever failing to operate when set in motion.

We have, then, an Infinite Spirit and an Infinite Law; Intelligence and
the way that It works; God, working through Law, which is unfailing and
certain.

**FORMS OF SPIRIT OR CREATION**

Next, we come to the forms of Spirit, which forms we call matter. But
what is matter? Science tells us that matter is eternal and
indestructible; that, at first, it is an invisible cosmic stuff; and
that it gradually takes form through some law working within it. The
worlds were formed by the power of His Word. We know that right now
worlds are being formed in the vast reaches of space, and worlds are
also ceasing to be; that is, they are gradually losing their form. In
this way Creation is eternally going on. This proves a definite
purposefulness, a definite law set in motion to work out this
purposefulness, and a definite form as the result of the operation of
this purposefulness. In other words, it shows that there is an
Intelligence inherent in the universe which knows what It is doing, and
how to do it, and which knows why It does it; and that there is a law
obeying Its will. It also shows that there is something upon which It
operates. This "something" we will call matter in its unformed state.
Perhaps this is "the ether" of science; it is impossible to say; but
surely there is something upon which the Spirit works.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

The teaching of the great thinkers of all times is that we live in a
threefold universe of Spirit, Soul and Body--of Intelligence, Substance
and Form.

**MEANING OF CREATION**

With this in mind, we shall be better able to realize that Creation does
not mean making something out of nothing, but means the passing of
Substance into form through a law which is set in motion by the Word of
Spirit. Creation is eternally going on; for we could not imagine a time
when the activity of Spirit would cease. It is "the same yesterday,
to-day and forever." <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

The whole action of Spirit must be within Itself, upon the Law, which is
also within Itself, and upon the Universal Stuff, or matter, which is
also within Itself. The three must in reality be One; hence, "The
Trinity."

**THE WORD ALONE IS CONSCIOUS**

One of the main facts to bear in mind is, that, of the three attributes
of Spirit, the Word alone is conscious of Itself. The Law is force, and
matter is simply stuff ready to take form. Since law or energy is proven
to be timeless, that is, not added to or taken from; and since matter is
known to be of the same nature, we have a right to suppose that both
matter and law are coexistent and coeternal with Spirit. But Spirit
alone is Conscious. Law, of itself, is only a force, and matter has no
mind of its own. Law is not a thinker but is a doer, while matter cannot
think but is thought upon.

**THE THOUGHT OF GOD**

Just what is meant by the Word of God? This must mean the Inner
Consciousness, or Self-Knowingness, of Spirit; the Thought of God. The
word "thought" seems to mean more to us than any other word; it seems to
cover the meaning better,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

for we know that thought is an inner process or consciousness.

The Thought of God must be back of all that really exists, and, as there
are many things that really exist, there must be many thoughts in the
Mind of the Infinite. This is logical to suppose; for an Infinite Mind
can think of an infinite number of ideas. Hence the world of
multiplicity or many things. But the world of multiplicity does not
contradict the world of Unity; for the many live in the One.

**ETERNAL CREATION**

There may be confusion in the minds of men but not in the Thought of
God; and so we have a universe expressing the limitless Ideas of a
Limitless Mind, and without confusion. We have, then, a Cosmic World,
and an infinite and endless Creation. This is the inner meaning of those
mystic words, "World without end." Creation always was and always will
be. Things may come and things may go, but Creation goes on forever; for
It is the Thought of God coming into expression. This is, indeed, a
wonderful concept, for it means that there will always be a
manifestation of the Divine Ideas. We need not worry about whether it
will ever cease; it cannot cease so long as God exists; and since God
will be forever, there will forever be some kind of manifestation.

**THE UNIVERSE IS ALIVE**

The universe is alive with action and power, with energy and life. We
touch it only in parts, but from these parts we do catch a glimpse of
the nature of the Whole. "He hath not left Himself without a
witness." <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) Modern science is revealing
many things that the great thinkers of the ages have announced. One of
them is that matter is in a constant state of flow; it is like a river
flowing in, out and on; it is operated upon by an unseen force or law
and takes its form through some agency which science supposes to be the
Will and Purpose

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

of Spirit. This we call the Word. All things were made by the Word.

**CONCLUSION**

To sum up: There is a power in the universe which acts as though It were
Intelligent and we may assume that It is. There is an activity in the
universe which acts as law. We know this to be true. And there is a
formless stuff in the universe, forever taking form, and forever
changing its form; this also is self-evident. We have every right, then,
to assume that there is a threefold nature of Being which we will call
Spirit, Soul and Body. We will think of the Spirit as the great Actor,
the Soul as the medium of Its action, and the Body as the result of this
action. We will think of Spirit as the only Conscious Actor, the only
Power that knows Itself. We will think of Soul as a blind force, obeying
the Will of Spirit; and we will think of Body as the effect of the
Spirit, working through law, thus producing form. We will say that
neither the Law nor the stuff from which form comes has any conscious
intelligence, but must, because of its nature, take the form of the
Word. This simplifies the whole matter and enables us to see that in the
entire universe One Power Alone really acts, the Power of the Word of
God.

The chart in lesson one of this series is an attempt to portray the
Threefold Nature of the Universe; to show how the Spirit, acting through
Law, becomes Form; for this is the inner meaning of Creation.
