### Lesson Two: Recapitulation

Man reënacts the Divine Nature on all three planes; he is self-knowing
in his conscious mind, creative through his subconscious mind, and has a
body. He reënacts the Trinity of Being.

Man is in perfect unity with the Whole. His conscious mind is his
understanding of God; his subjective mind is the use that he makes of
the Universal Creative Medium; and his body is one with the Body of God.

There is but One Mind in the Universe, and man uses It. Man is an
identity in the Universe; he is a center of God-Consciousness. At first
he is ignorant of this and misuses his power, consequently bringing upon
himself misfortune and sickness.

Man's thought operates through the medium of Universal Creative Mind. As
he thinks within himself, he thinks upon Creative Mind and sets Law in
motion. Since there is but One Mind a person may think for himself, or
for some one else, and cause the Law to operate as he directs.

The use of Creative Mind is like the use of the creative soil. Man never
creates; he simply uses a Creative Law.

Objective, conscious and self-knowing mind, all have the same meaning;
they mean that part of man which knows that it exists.

Subjective, subconscious, unconscious, soul and consciousness have the
same meaning; they mean the inner creative medium.

Body, effect and outward conditions all respond to the inner thought.

The Spirit of man, which is his self-knowingness, is the only part of
him which has volition or self-choice; all else is automatic law.

Man's conscious thought, acting through law, may change any condition in
his experience, provided he can clearly conceive of that condition as
being changed. There is no limit to

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the Law. The limit is not in the Law but in man's ability to embody the
Truth and constructively use the Law.

Remember, there is but One Mind and One Law which all people use,
consciously or unconsciously, constructively or destructively; One
Spirit, One Mind, One Law, One Substance, but many forms. There is only
One Ultimate Reality, but within this One there are many experiences.
Man is within the One and draws from It any and all experiences in which
he believes.

As man thinks he subjectifies thought and sets Law in motion through the
Medium of the Universal Mind. *This Law works automatically until It is
consciously changed.*

Man uses a Power which is Infinite as compared with the power of his
conscious thought.

Divine Principle means Universal Subjective Law; It is the Medium of all
thought and action.

Freedom and bondage, sickness and health, poverty and riches, heaven and
hell, good and bad, big and little, happiness and misery, peace and
confusion, faith and fear and all conditions that appear as opposites,
are not really opposing powers, but are the way that the One Power is
used.

Man has within himself the key to every situation, but he must come to
realize his relation to the Whole. That relationship is one of Perfect
Unity.
