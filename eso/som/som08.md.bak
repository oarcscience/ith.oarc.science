### Lesson One: The Nature of Being

The circle in Chart No. I signifies Universal Life, because it is
without beginning and without end. We have divided it into three parts,
calling one Spirit, one Soul and the other Body; not because the nature
of Being is three distinct things, but because It is a Unity with three
distinct attributes, i.e., Spirit, Soul and Body.

**SPIRIT**

We treat of Spirit as the Active and the only Self-Conscious Principle.
We define Spirit as the First Cause or God; the Absolute Essence of all
that is. It is also called the great, or the Universal, I AM. When Moses
asked God who he should tell the Children of Israel had sent him, the
answer was, "Thus shalt thou say, I AM hath sent me unto you." <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) The reason why "I AM" was given is
because this is an absolute statement. Spirit is Conscious Mind, and is
the Power Which knows Itself; It is conscious of Its own Being. The
Spirit is Self-Propelling; it is Absolute and All. It is Self-Existent,
and has all life within Itself. It is the Word, and the Word is
volition. It has choice because It is Volition; It is will because It
chooses; It is Free Spirit because It knows nothing outside Itself, and
nothing different from Itself.

Spirit is the Father-Mother God because It is the principle of Unity
back of all things. The masculine and feminine principles both come from
the One. Spirit is all Life, Truth, Love, Being, Cause and Effect; and
is the only Power in the Universe that knows Itself.

**SOUL**

The Soul of the Universe, not as opposed to the Spirit, but as the
principle just beneath It, has always been taught as the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

receptive medium into which the Spirit lets fall the forms of Its
thought. It is subjective to the Spirit; that which is subjective is
always impersonal, neutral, plastic, passive and receptive. Wherever you
find subjective law you will find something that is compelled to receive
and to act upon; consequently the Soul of the Universe has been called a
"blind force, not knowing, only doing," and "The servant of the Eternal
Spirit throughout the ages." It is the medium of the thought, power and
action of the Spirit.

**TWO WAYS OF REASONING**

There are but two processes of reasoning known to the human mind; one is
inductive and the other is deductive. Inductive reasoning is an inquiry
into the truth; it is a process of analysis. Deductive reasoning is that
process of reasoning which follows an already established premise. It is
from the whole to a part. Here is an example of inductive reasoning: I
look about and say, "John Smith is good; Mary Jones is good; my
neighbors are good; consequently, God must be good." This is a process
of analysis which leads to the conclusion that the Cause back of all
things must be Good. Deductive reasoning would operate this way: "God is
Good; consequently, Mary Jones, John Smith and my neighbors must be
good"; because God is Good they cannot be otherwise.

Since inductive reasoning is an analysis, which is always an inquiry
into truth, it follows that God can reason only deductively. That which
is Infinite does not have to inquire into the Truth; consequently, there
can be no inductive process of reasoning, either in the Spirit or the
soul of the Universe. There cannot be any inductive reasoning in the
Spirit, because It already knows all things. There cannot be any
inductive reasoning in the Soul of the Universe, because It is the
Creative Medium, and, if It could reason inductively, It could reject
certain thoughts, because It could analyze; and soul or subjectivity can
never reject; but is bound by its own nature to accept. It is
impersonal, and neither knows nor cares who uses it. It is plastic,
because It is immaterial. It is formless, having no mind of Its own. It
has been called the Universal Feminine

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

or Holy Womb of Nature, because It is receptive and creative. It is
Karmic Law, because It is subjective to the self-knowing mind. It is the
medium of all Karmic Law and of all race suggestion.

**BODY**

The Universe has been called the Great Trinity, or Triune Unity of
Spirit, Soul and Body. The body is the result, the effect, the
objectification of Spirit. Soul is the Immaterial, plastic and receptive
medium; It is primordial or Cosmic Stuff; It is unmanifest form. Body is
the result of Spirit working through Soul or Law. There is but one Body
of the Universe; It is both visible and invisible; and within this one
body are all of the lesser bodies, all of the manifest Universe,
including the body of man. "But now are they many members yet but One
Body." <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

Spirit is the Absolute Being; and is the only power in the universe
which has self-knowingness, volition, choice or will. The soul has no
will; It has no purpose to execute other than the purpose that is given
It. Soul is the servant of the Spirit, while body is the result of the
union of Spirit with Soul. There is the Power, the way that It works and
the result of Its operation; the Word, the law, and the effect;
Intelligence, substance, and form; the Active Principle, the passive
receptivity, and the relative condition. The Spirit of the Universe
cannot change; the Soul of the Universe cannot change; the Body of the
Universe cannot help changing.

**THE CHANGELESS**

The Spirit cannot change because there is nothing for It to change into,
Spirit being All; this is axiomatic. The Soul of the Universe cannot
change; for it is simply Universal Substance and Law; and we know that
energy and substance are indestructible and eternal. The Soul of the
Universe cannot change; but, as stated above, the body of the universe
is forever changing; and this is what constitutes the eternal activity
of Spirit within Itself.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

Creation does not mean making something out of nothing. If by Creation
we mean making something out of nothing, there is no such thing; but if
we mean the passing of Spirit into form, then Creation is eternally
going on.

It is necessary to understand that the only Active Principle is
Spirit--Self-Conscious, Self-Knowing Life, and that all else is subject
to Its will. The Spirit is conscious of Its own Thought, Its own Desire
and manifestation; and It is conscious that Its desire is satisfied;
consequently, It is conscious of that which It manifests; but It is not
conscious of any effort or process in Its manifestation.

It is necessary that Soul and Body should exist, because Spirit, without
manifestation, would construct only a dream world, never coming into
Self-Realization. Since Spirit must be manifested, in order to be
Spirit, there must be a way in which It manifests, and there must be a
manifestation; hence, Soul and Body.

**CAUSE AND EFFECT**

If all Cause is existent in Spirit, and if the Law which executes the
volition of Spirit is entirely subconscious, or subjective to the Will
of the Spirit, and if the body is only an effect, it follows that both
cause and effect are spiritual. Involved within the seed, which the
Spirit drops into the Creative Medium, is everything necessary to unfold
the seed into form. This is why the Spirit never thinks of methods or
processes; for that which the Spirit involves must evolve.

**UNITY AND MULTIPLICITY**

From Unity--which is the One back of all things, through the One Law,
which is the medium of the One--multiplicity is manifested, but it never
contradicts Unity. When we realize that we are dealing with an Infinite
Intelligence, and with an Infinite Law within this Intelligence, we see
that there can be no limit placed upon Creation. We think of the world
as we see it, but we see it from the viewpoint of only one plane. We see
it as matter, which we have divided into eighty or ninety

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

odd elements; but we discover that all of these elements come from one
substance. Suppose we should view it from ten different planes, what
would happen? We should see ten times as much as we now see. The present
hypothesis of science is that the ether is more solid than matter; and
this means that there could be a form within the very form that one's
body now occupies in space; there might even be a million bodies, each
within the other; and each would be just as real as the one that we now
think we occupy. The Universe, as we see it, is not even a fractional
part of the Universe that actually is. "Eye hath not seen," <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) because it sees only on one plane, i.e.,
in part.

**IMMORTALITY**

From the standpoint of immortality, we may have a body within a body to
infinity; and when this body is rendered useless, and is no longer a fit
instrument through which to function, another one may be already there.

The physical disappearance of Jesus after His resurrection was the
result of the spiritualization of His consciousness. This so quickened
His mentality that His body disintegrated; and His followers could not
see Him because He was on another plane. Planes are not places; they are
states of consciousness.

Is it apparent that the Spirit can know nothing outside Itself; that
whatever the Spirit knows must be a definite mental image, concept, or
idea, in the Consciousness of the Spirit? Is it clear that as the
Self-Consciousness of Spirit knows within Itself, It knows upon Itself
as Law? Is it clear that the Law can never say, "I will not," but can
only act? And is it clear that as the Spirit lets fall the forms of Its
thought into the Soul, or Subjectivity of the Universe, these thoughts
must manifest as things?

**FORMS**

Let us take a look at these forms. As we look at the many millions of
forms, and see that they are all of different shape

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and color, and yet we know that they all came from One Stuff, are we not
compelled to accept the fact that there is a specific cause, or concrete
mental image, back of every idea or thing, a Divine Mental Picture? In
the subjective world there must be a correspondent of everything in the
objective world; and since the subjective world is a receptive or
plastic substance, this correspondence can find its initial starting
point only in real Intelligence. Therefore, Intelligence is ultimately
all there is in the universe.

**ALLNESS** **OF TRUTH**

By a process of axiomatic reasoning, we arrive at the conclusion that
Spirit knows nothing outside Itself. The Truth is that which Is; and
being that which Is, It must be Infinite and All. Being Infinite or All,
the Truth can have nothing outside Itself, other than Itself, or unlike
Itself, by which to divide Itself; consequently, the Spirit is
Indivisible, Changeless and Complete within Itself. Itself is all that
is--both Cause and Effect, the Alpha and the Omega.

**VOLITION**

There is but one volitional factor in the Universe, and this is Spirit
or the Self-Knowing Mind. God did not make God; this is self-evident;
hence God is Self-Existent. God did not make Law; Law is coeternal with
God. God did not make Substance; this, also is coexistent and coeternal
with God. But God did make, and does make, and is making, and will
continue to make, from eternity to eternity--forms. We live in a
universe of Infinite Substance and numberless forms wherein nothing is
moved unless Intelligence moves it.

Mind is dual in its aspect; it is conscious, as the active principle of
conscious intelligence, and subconscious, as the passive principle of
impersonal receptivity. Body is the result of the knowing of Spirit
through Soul. Matter, of itself, has no intelligence, no volition, no
power. Since the Law is but a Universal Potential Possibility through
which anything might happen, and since it is set in motion by the Word,
it follows that

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

every word specializes its own law and carries its own mathematics along
with it.

It follows that everything that the Spirit thinks must take form. The
Spirit, being Self-Conscious Life, knows and cannot stop knowing. To
suppose that it could stop knowing would be to suppose that It could
stop being. Since It cannot stop knowing, It must be forever setting in
motion the Law of Its own Being, which Law must be forever projecting
the forms of Its thoughts, there by producing things. Creation is always
beginning, but never ending. The slightest thought of Intelligence sets
in motion a power in the Law to produce a corresponding thing.

When we speak of every thought dropped into the Creative Medium, do we
think of God's thought and man's as the same? We think of each as
thought; but, whereas man thinks both inductively and deductively, God
thinks only deductively. "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he," <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) i.e., as he lets fall the forms of his
thought.

God is not conscious of matter, as we are. God is conscious of Himself
as form, but not as size. God is conscious of Himself as definite
purposefulness, but not as space. God is conscious of Himself as
definite outline, but not as limitation. God is conscious of Himself as
many, but not as division.

Would there be any difference between a conscious thought, for the
purpose of a direct manifestation, and one that might be thought with no
idea of the form that would be manifested? There would be a great
difference. Trained thought is far more powerful than untrained. If this
were not true, the thoughts of the metaphysical practitioner could not
neutralize those that caused his patient his patient to be sick. We know
a little right thought puts to rout that which is wrong. The day that
you say to yourself, "My thought is powerful," you would better be
careful. *Every thought must manifest according to its intensity*.

Ponder over the meaning of the words in Chart No. I. Think what
Self-Existent Life is--Life within Itself; get an understanding of the
Law which is the Servant of it, and what

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

matter is, until you begin to feel your own self as part of this great
scheme of Existence.

**ONLY ONE MIND**

There is no such thing as your mind, my mind, his mind, her mind and
God's Mind; there is just Mind in which we all live, move and have our
being. There is Mind and nothing but Mind. We think of Conscious Mind
and Spirit as One and the Same.

Things are ideas. What else could they be? There is nothing out of which
to make things, except ideas. In the beginning we behold nothing
visible; there is only an infinite possibility, a Limitless Imagination,
a Consciousness; the only action of this Consciousness being idea.

That which we call our subjective mind is, in reality, our identity in
Infinite Mind; in other words, it is the result of our mental attitudes.
It is our mental atmosphere or center in universal Subjective Mind, in
which are retained all the images, impressions, inherited tendencies and
race suggestions as far as we accept them.

We see, then, that this is the Medium through which everything comes to
us.

There is One First Cause, having three aspects: Spirit, Soul and Body,
i.e., Cause, Medium and Effect; the Father, Son and Holy Ghost;
Masculine Activity, Feminine Activity and Result.

We should not think of three Gods, but of the Triune Nature of the One
God, the One Cause. We think of Spirit as Absolute, Self-Conscious
Intelligence. We think of Soul as Receptive to Intelligence; and of the
Intelligence as always acting upon It. Spirit and Soul intersphere each
other; i.e., both have Omnipresence. The Spirit of the Universe
permeates the Soul of the Universe, eternally impregnating It with
ideas. The Soul of the Universe is the "Holy Womb of Nature," producing
the forms which appear in the physical Universe.

The Body of the Universe is the result of the thought of Spirit,
operating through the medium of Soul. This Trinity is called the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. The Father

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

is Absolute, Positive Intelligence; the Son is the Offspring of the
Father; the holy Ghost is "the Servant of The Eternal Spirit throughout
the Ages." Spirit is Absolute Intelligence, operating through the Soul
of Receptive Intelligence, impregnating It with "The Divine Ideas."

Neither the Spirit nor the Soul of the Universe can change. That which
changes is the Body of the Universe. Planets may appear and disappear as
do people and things; but the Substance from which things are formed is
Changeless.

**INDIVIDUALITY**

Individuality emerges from the Universal. Psychology teaches the
personification of this individuality, which is true as far as it goes;
but Metaphysics universalizes individuality by unifying it with the
Whole.

There is a Universal Nature of Man, inherent within him, which causes
the manifestation of his personality, i.e., The Spirit of God.

The next chart will be about man, and when that is explained you will
begin to see the way out of your difficulties if you have any.

Troward; "Creative Mind," by Ernest S. Holmes; "The Axioms of Truth," by
Burnell; "Philosophy of Plotinus," by Dean Inge.
