### EVOLUTION

All emerge from that One Whose Being is ever present and Whose Life,
robed in numberless forms, is manifest throughout all Creation.

Creation is the logical result of the outpush of Life into
self-expression. It is the coming forth of Spirit into manifestation,
the externalization of an internal idea, through the objectification of
a subjective image.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

The One encompasses and flows through the All, spilling Itself into
numberless forms and shapes. These forms and shapes, propelled by a
Divine Urge which brings them into being, seek still further expression
because of the dynamic power with which they are equipped.

This is the real meaning of evolution; for evolution is the result of
intelligence and not its cause.

Each evolving thing has, within itself, an impulse implanted by the
Divine; and since the Divine is Limitless and Perfect, It must and will,
ultimately, bring all Creation to a state of perfect manifestation.

That which, to the human eye, appears as imperfect, is imperfect only
because the human eye sees imperfectly or in part; i.e., the human does
not see the real idea back of the external image.

There is a philosophy which states that there is a "Becoming God," and
which attempts to prove this assertion through evolution; but this
philosophy is inconsistent with the ultimate nature of Reality; for, if
ultimate Reality were in a state of "becoming,' from what source would
It gather Its impulse to become, and from whence would It draw Its power
to express Itself?

A "becoming" or evolving God, or First Cause, is not consistent with
true philosophy; while, on the other hand, an unfolding God, or First
Cause, is consistent with Reality.

It is one thing to say that God is unfolding through His Idea of Himself
but quite another thing to say that He is gradually becoming conscious
of Himself. One is true while the other is false.

A "becoming" God implies a state of imperfection, or a state of being
which does not recognize its perfection, at the very root of all being.
An unfolding God implies a forever-out-pouring Spirit and a
forever-manifesting Deity, or First Cause.

The unfoldment of this First Cause is what we call evolution. Since this
unfoldment is not yet complete, i.e., since the idea is still in an
unfolding state, it appears as though we lived in an imperfect universe.

To a few, who have been able to see behind the veil of matter, the
perfect idea has been apparent; and these few have

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

given to the world its greatest code of law, morals and ethics. These
few have been the great mystics of the race, and to them the world owes
a debt which can be paid only to the degree that the world comes to
understand their teachings.

Evolution is the time and the process through which an idea unfolds to a
higher state of manifestation; and since ideas are Divine Realities,
evolution will forever go on.
