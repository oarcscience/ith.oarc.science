## *Part IV:* Daily Meditations for Self-help and Healing

In these short meditations I have tried to set forth some ideas which my
experiences in mental healing have given me. I have found that a few
brief statements, mentally affirmed, followed by a silent meditation,
have been most effective in the healing work.

Most of the meditations have been written in the first person in order
that those using them may be able to do so just as they are written.

It is not claimed that there is any occult power in these words, but
that words similar to these are effective in inducing a greater
realization of life. They contain thoughts which I have found to be most
helpful.

Try them, my good reader, and see if they will not bring to life a
deeper meaning and a greater joy. Whatever brings to the mentality a
greater realization of life has, within itself, a healing power. I
believe that these meditations will help all who take the time to use
them.

First, decide which meditation you wish to use; then become quiet and
composed. The body should be relaxed but the mentality should be active.
Then, carefully read the meditation several times, phrase by phrase,
endeavoring to realize the meaning of the words and trying to enter into
the atmosphere of the thought. After having done this, meditate upon the
words, following that meditation until you feel a sense of realization.
