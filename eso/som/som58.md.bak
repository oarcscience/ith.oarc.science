### SPIRIT OF GOD WITHIN

**ARISE, MY SPIRIT**

Arise, my Spirit, arise and shine.  
Let Thy light illumine my path, and let Thy wisdom direct my way.  
Compel my will to do Thy bidding, and command my Soul to look to Thee.  
I will follow Thee, my Spirit, and will learn of Thee all that I need to
know.  
I will sit in the Silence and listen and watch, and  
I will see Thy light and hear Thy voice.  
II will follow Thee and will not depart from Thee,  
for in Thee alone is Peace.

*Arise and shine*.

 

**BIRTHLESS** **AND DEATHLESS**

The Spirit within me is Birthless and deathless;  
It was not born and It cannot die.  
I have no fear of death, for I perceive that  
Death is an illusion and not the Truth.  
I was born of the Spirit, and I live in the Spirit,  
And shall continue to live in and by the Spirit.

*The Spirit within me lives forever*.

 

**COMMAND MY SOUL**

Spirit within me, command my Soul to do Thy bidding;  
Compel me to follow the course of Truth and Wisdom.  
Control my inward thoughts and my outward ways,  
And make me to understand Thy Laws.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

Command my Soul to turn to Thee for guidance and light;  
To turn to Thee for wisdom and knowledge.  
Let the paths of my Life be made straight and sure;  
Let the Journey of my Soul find its completion in Thee.

*Command my Soul to do Thy bidding*.

 

**DESPAIR GIVES WAY TO JOY**

Despair gives way to joy at the thought of Thee, Indwelling Good.  
I cannot be sad when I think of Thee.  
My sorrow is turned to gladness and my shame to rejoicing.  
My tears are wiped away and the sunlight of the Spirit shines through
the clouds of depression and lights the way to Heaven.

*Thy Joy has made me glad*.

 

**FREE SPIRIT WITHIN ME**

Free Spirit within me, Unbound and Perfect, teach me Thy ways and make
known to me Thy Limitless Completion.  
O Spirit of Life, control my every action and thought.  
Compel me to follow Thy light that I too may be free and complete.  
I will follow Thy footsteps and learn of Thee all the wondrous secrets
of Life.  
I will follow Thy light into the Perfect Day.

*Free spirit within me*.

 

**FULLNESS OF LIGHT**

The Light of Life is full within me and around me.  
It shines forth into the Perfect Day.

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

O Light within, lighting my path to peace,  
I adore and love You and I let You shine.  
Go forth and bless all who come to You, Light within.  
My Light radiates to all and through all.

*My light has come*.

**HE WHO INHABITS ETERNITY**

He Who inhabits Eternity keeps watch over me and mine.  
"He Who neither slumbers nor sleeps" forever keeps watch over all.  
I will rest in the assurance of Love and Protection.  
O Thou Great Overshadowing Presence,

I am conscious of Thy care; I am aware of Thy loving kindness. I rest in
Thee.

*Be still and know*.

 

**I LISTEN**

I will listen for Thy voice, Inner Presence.  
It will guide me and acquaint me with all knowledge.  
Thy voice is sweet and tender; it is always kind and gentle.  
O Lover of my Soul, how I adore Thee! How I love Thee!  
How I love Thy voice; it thrills me with gladness and joy.  
It fills me with peace and calm, and it soothes me.  
It quiets me and gives me wonderful rest.  
I listen, O Divine Speaker, I listen to Thee alone.

*I listen for Thy voice*.

 

**JOY HAS COME TO LIVE WITH ME**

Joy has come to live with me. How can I be sad?  
I do so love Thy presence, which is Joy within me.

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

It makes me glad, and I sing, for I am so filled with Thy Spirit that I
cannot be depressed nor unhappy.  
I am filled with the joy of the Spirit, and I overflow with the gladness
of life.  
Thou art a Happy Companion to travel with me through Life, wonderful
Joy, Thou art so radiant and beaming.  
It is impossible to be sad in Thy presence.  
I shall give myself to Thee and remain with Thee, for Thou art complete
and satisfying.  
I find fulfillment in Thee and joy forevermore.

*I am filled with the Spirit of Joy*.

 

**KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM**

All Wisdom and Knowledge is from within.  
And my God, Who is All-Knowing, is also within.  
I am guided and guarded along Life's road into the All Good.  
My Mind is instructed from On High,  
And my Wisdom cometh from afar.

*The Spirit within me is All Wisdom*.

 

**MY THOUGHT IS IN THEE**

My thought is in Thee, Inner Light.  
My words are from Thee, Inner Wisdom.  
My understanding is of Thee, Inner God.  
I cannot be hid from Thee, my Inspiration and my Life.

*My thought is in Thee*.

 

**O LOVE DIVINE**

O Love Divine within me, I am overpowered by Thy Presence.  
I am speechless, for words cannot utter the things that Thou hast
revealed to me.

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

Why dost Thou love me so, and why clasp me so close to Thy Eternal
Heart?  
O Blessed Presence, I know, for Thou hast claimed me as Thine own.  
I shall nevermore walk apart from Thee.

*The love of God is within me*.

 

**PEACE STEALS THROUGH THE SOUL**

Peace steals through the waiting Soul, and the comfort of the Spirit
comes into the stillness of the heart.  
Peace, like an ocean of Infinite Life, reflects itself through me and
calms every turbulent feeling.  
I am at peace and rest in the knowledge of the All Good which is at
hand.

*I rest in peace*.

 

**STAND FORTH AND SPEAK**

Stand forth and speak, Spirit within me.  
Proclaim Thy presence, announce Thy course.  
Declare through me Thy wondrous works and  
Let the children of men hear Thy voice.  
Behold, He maketh all things new.  
The Spirit within speaks words of Truth and Life to all.  
The Spirit within me is God.

*I speak the Truth*.

 

**SUBTLE ESSENCE OF SPIRIT WITHIN ME**

Subtle Essence of Spirit within me, flowing through me;  
Elixir of Life in my veins purifying me with Thy marvelous Life,

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

I let Thy Spirit cleanse me from all false thought and ideas;  
I let Thy Life flow through me in a complete and Perfect Whole.

*I feel the presence of Spirit within me*.

 

**THE CHRIST WITHIN**

My Life is "hid with Christ in God";  
The Inner Man is the image and likeness of the Spirit of God.  
I let that Inner Man come forth into expression in my life;  
He will guide my feet into all Truth and Wisdom.  
The Christ within me is free from all worry, and cannot be hindered by
any opposing force.  
My Christ within me is now perfect.

*My Christ is within me*.

 

**THE EVERLASTING ARMS**

His Arms enfold me, His Strength upholds me,  
His Presence fills me with Life and Joy.  
I shall nevermore be sad nor depressed, for I know that I do not walk
Life's path alone.  
There is One Who goes with me and tells me all the things that I should
know.  
There is a Presence with me guiding me into the Perfect Way.

*I rejoice in knowing that I am not alone*.

 

**THE MANTLE OF LOVE**

Like a cloak His Love is wrapped around me. Like a warm garment It
shelters me from the storms of life.  
I feel and know that an Almighty Love envelops me in Its close embrace.

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

O Love Divine, My Love, how wonderful Thou art. I am open to receive Thy
great blessing.

*Love envelops me*.

 

**THE VOICE OF TRUTH**

The Voice of Truth speaks to me and through me.  
The Voice of Truth guides me and keeps me on the Path of the Perfect
Day.  
I will listen to the Inner Voice and It will tell me what to do in the
hour of need.  
I shall be told everything that I ought to know when the time of need
arrives, and I shall not be misled.  
The Voice of Truth cannot lie, but always speaks to me from On High.  
Nothing enters but This Voice, for it is the Voice of God.

*God speaks to me*.

 

**THE WITNESS OF TRUTH**

There is a Witness within me who knows the Truth and who will not let me
enter into falsehood.  
My Inner Guide keeps me on the Pathway of Life and directs me at all
times to that which is right and best.  
I shall never be without this witness of the Spirit, for I believe in It
and accept It as the Great Companion of the Soul.

*The Spirit within me is perfect now*.

 

**THROUGH THE LONG NIGHT WATCHES**

Through the long night watches Thou hast been with me.  
In the dark places of human ignorance Thy hand hath guided me,

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

Thy light hath lighted the pathway of desolation to a land of plenty.  
I have perceived Thee from afar, and my soul hath yearned to Thee, O
Thou Mighty One!  
The Spirit within me hath urged me on to the goal, and I have not been
misled.  
I have been guided and guarded through the long journey, and Thy
Presence hath been made known to me.  
I awake from the dream and reenter the house of my Lord clothed with
Peace and robed in colors of Light.

*The Spirit of Truth watches over me*.

 

**THY STRENGTH IS SUFFICIENT**

O Spirit of man and God within me, Thy Power is great, and Thy Knowledge
goes beyond the range of human experience.  
Thy Wisdom excels that of all else, and beside Thee there is none
other.  
In Thy Strength do I daily walk and live;  
In Thy Presence do I always rest in peace and joy.  
Spirit within me and without, Powerful Thou art, and Great;  
Wonderful is Thy Might, and Complete is Thy Understanding.  
I let Thy Mighty Strength flow through me,  
And out into all the paths of my human endeavors.

*Life from within expresses through me*.

 

**WAITING ON THEE**

In waiting on Thee there is fulness of Life.  
I wait on Thee, my Inner Lord; I listen for Thy voice.  
I hear Thy word; I do Thy will; again I wait on Thee.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

And listening, I hear Thee say: "Be perfect, be complete; live, love, be
glad."

*Sit thou in the stillness and let thy Lord speak*.

 

**WHOSE RIGHT IT IS TO COME**

He has come Whose right it is.  
He has made His home within me, and will nevermore depart from me.  
I shall walk no more alone, for One walks with me  
Who knows the path of Life, and Whose feet will never falter nor fail.  
My Inner Light shines through the mist of human beliefs  
And frees me from the bondage of fear and limitation.  
I shall walk with You, my Friend, and shall learn of You the ways of
Life and Freedom.  
We shall travel together from this day, and none can part us,  
For we are united in the perfect bonds of an everlasting unity.

*I walk with Thee*.
