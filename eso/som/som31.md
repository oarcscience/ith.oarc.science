### THE GARDEN OF EDEN

The Garden of Eden typifies man's original state of perfection before he
began to have experience. The Tree of Knowledge means the Life Principle
which can be used both ways. It bore the fruit of the knowledge of both
kinds of experience, good and evil, freedom and limitation. Man must
choose which kind of fruit he will eat. "Choose ye this day whom ye will
serve." <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) Man makes his choice
consciously but generally in ignorance. The serpent typifies the Life
Principle viewed from the materialistic viewpoint; it casts man from his
perfect state through his belief in duality and separation. Man chose to
depart from Good, and man alone must choose to return to It. God lets
him alone; for he is a free agent and may do as he wills with himself.
When man decides to return to his Father's House, he will find that his
Father is still there. "Act as though I am and I will be." "Onlook the
Deity and the Deity will onlook thee." "Be firm and ye shall be made
firm." "As though hast believed so be it done unto thee." <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) "Ask and it shall be given unto you;
seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened unto you." <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) God's Creation is Perfect and we must
wake to the fact and know that we are now in the Kingdom of Heaven.
