**PEACE BE UNTO THEE, STRANGER**

eace be unto thee, stranger, enter and be not afraid.  
I have left the gate open and thou art welcome to my home.  
There is room in my house for all.  
I have swept the hearth and lighted the fire.  
The room is warm and cheerful and you will find comfort and rest
within.  
The table is laid and the fruits of Life are spread before thee.  
The wine is here also, it sparkles in the light.  
I have set a chair for you where the sunbeams dance through the shade.  
Sit and rest and refresh your soul.  
Eat of the fruit and drink the wine.  
All, all is yours, and you are welcome.
