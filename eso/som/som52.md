**DIVINE COMPANIONSHIP**

**A SONG OF HOPE**

My Life is in Thee, O Inner Presence.  
I look upon Thee and hope springs forth into realization.  
O Hope within me, undying evidence of Good,  
Thou dost completely hold me in Thy loving embrace,  
And from this fond caress assurance shall be born, and confidence and
love.

*My hope is in Thee*.

**BE STILL AND KNOW**

"Be still and know that I am God."  
I am still in Thy Presence.  
I am quiet and peaceful, for I put my trust in Thee.  
A great stillness steals over me and a great calm quiets my whole being,
as I realize Thy Presence.  
The heart knows of Thee, O Most High within.  
It is still in Thy Presence, and it puts its whole confidence in Thee
alone.

*In Thy Presence I am still*.

 

**CAST ASIDE ALL DOUBT**

Cast aside all doubt, O Soul of mine, and be unafraid, for Thy power is
from On High.  
He Who sitteth in the heavens shall be Thy champion;  
Thou need not fear; Come forth, O Spirit, from within and express
Thyself through me and let not my doubts hinder Thy approach.  
My faith shall go forth to meet Thee, and my confidence shall embrace
Thee.  
My waiting thought shall bid Thee welcome to my house of Love,  
And Joy shall accompany us through the ages yet to come.

*I lay aside all fear and doubt*.

 

**DIVINE COMPANIONSHIP**

I have an Inner Friend who walks and talks with me daily.  
He is not afar off, but is within me, a constant companion.  
I shall never become lonely, for my Friend is always near.  
I have but to speak and He answers.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

Before ever my lips spoke He told me of His love.  
O my kind Friend, how dear to me is Thy presence.

*The Spirit within me is my Friend*.

 

**HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW**

"His eye is on the sparrow and I know He watches me."  
This is a blessed thought, for it means that we cannot wander from His
Presence, nor depart from His care.  
Always He will watch over us and comfort us.  
Forever we shall sit in His house and ceaselessly He will care for us.  
The All-Seeing Eye cannot overlook any one, and all, all shall be kept
in His care.

*All are kept in His care*.

 

**HOPE CANNOT DIE**

Hope cannot die. Eternal Hope is forever warm and fresh within me; the
deathless Hope built upon the rock of sure knowledge.  
O Hope Sublime, O Life Supreme, behold I come to Thee as a tired child,
and Thou dost rekindle within me the fires of Faith.  
Strong, swift and sure, Faith springs forth into action and my entire
Being rises to meet the Dawn.

*Hope, Faith and Love are in me*.

 

**I AM NOT ALONE**

I am not alone, for a Presence goes with me and daily accompanies me on
my travels.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

Always I shall find this Divine Companion with me.  
He will not desert nor allow me to go alone.  
He will always be with me and near me, and will always provide for every
want.

*My life is hid with Christ in God*.

 

**I WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN**

I have discovered a Secret Place within, where the thought goes into a
mountain high above the din of the world.  
I have found in this mountain a Place of Peace and rest,  
A Place of joy and comfort to the heart.  
I have found that the Secret Place of God is within my own Soul.

*I will listen for Thy Voice*.

 

**THE JOY OF THE SOUL**

My Soul within me rejoices at the realization of Life.  
I am made glad as I behold my inner Light;  
I cannot be sad nor depressed, for the All Good has claimed me as Its
own.  
O Soul within me, rejoice and become glad, for Thy Light has come and
Thy Day of Salvation is at hand.  
Be still within me and behold Him Who sitteth On High.  
Reflect to me Thy revelation and flood me with Thy marvelous Light.

*I rejoice in my Life within me*.
