### BODILY PERFECTION

 

**COME, AND LET ME HEAL YOU**

Come to me and I will heal you.  
The inner power of Life within me is God, and it can heal anything.  
I will to heal and help all who come to me.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

I know that the realization of Life and Love within me heals all who
come into Its presence.  
I love the thought that I silently bless all who enter my atmosphere.  
It is not I, but The Father Who dwelleth in me; He doeth the works.

*I heal all who come near me*.

 

**HE IS MIGHTY WITHIN ME TO HEAL**

God within me is mighty to heal.  
He healeth me of all my diseases and cures me of all.  
God within is now healing me of all my infirmities, sickness and pain
and is bringing comfort to my soul.  
God is my life; I cannot be sick.  
I hear the voice of Truth telling me to arise and walk, for I am healed.

*I am healed*.

 

**I DO NOT INHERIT DISEASE**

There is no inherited tendency to disease, nor ill health.  
I am born of Pure Spirit and am free from the belief in material
existence.  
False ideas cannot be transmitted from one to another, and I am free
from all race-suggestion.  
My Life is from Above, and I remember that I was always Perfect and
Complete.  
An Inner Light shines forth and frees me from the bonds of all false
belief.

*I came from the Spirit.*

**NO CONGESTION**

There is no congestion nor stoppage of action.  
Life, flowing through me, is Perfect and Clear;  
It cannot be stopped, retarded nor hindered.  
I feel the One Life flowing through me now.  
It eliminates all impure secretions and washes me clean from all
suggestion of false deposits in the flesh.  
I am Clean, Pure and Perfect, and my Word eliminates all else.

*There is no congestion*.

 

**NO FALSE GROWTH**

"Every plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted
up."  
There is no false growth and nothing for one to feed on. I am free from
all thought of, or belief in, anything false or fearsome.  
I cast out all fear and with it all manifestation of Fear.  
A false idea is neither person, place nor thing, and has no one to
believe in it nor experience it.  
I am now One with The Perfect Life of Complete Wholeness.

*My Word casts out all fear*.

 

**NO WEARINESS**

There is no weariness.  
Mind and Spirit do not become tired nor weary, and I am Mind and
Spirit.  
The flesh cannot become weary, since it has no mind of its own.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

I am free from all illusions of weariness.  
My whole being responds to the thought of Life.  
I am alive with the Great Vitality of the Spirit.

*I am alive with spirit*.

 

**PERFECT HEALING**

My hearing is perfect.  
It is God in me hearing His own voice.  
I hear That Voice, and no belief in inaction can hinder that hearing.  
There are no impaired organs.  
Every idea of the body is now complete and perfect and functions
according to the Divine Law.  
I open my ears to hear.  
I am receptive to Truth and can understand it.

*Open my ears that I may hear.*

 

**PERFECT VISION**

There is One Vision and One ability to see, One perfect seeing.  
My eyes are open and I see and behold one Perfect Life.  
No suggestion of imperfect vision can enter my thought.  
I perceive that all people can see, and that the One, looking through
all, sees and cannot be limited in vision.  
I am one with that complete ability to see, to know and understand the
Truth.  
I do open my eyes and do see.  
Nothing in me can hinder this Word from operating through me and
manifesting through my eyes.

*Open my eyes that I may see*.

 

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

**THE ALL-SEEING EYE**

The Eye of the Spirit cannot be dimmed, neither can it be impaired in
Its ability to see.  
My eyes are the Vision of my Indwelling Lord; they are the Windows of my
Inner Spirit and are always open to the Vision of Truth.  
I see with the Vision of the Spirit, and that ability cannot be weakened
nor lost; it is forever effective.  
My word which I now speak is the Law of Perfect Sight and my eyes are
open and I see.

*Spirit sees through me*.

 

**THE HEALING OF THE FLESH**

My flesh is the Manifestation of the Spirit in my body.  
It is kept perfect through the Law of God.  
"In my flesh shall I see God."  
The mantle of flesh is perfect and complete here and now.  
It is one with the Body of God, and cannot be sick, nor suffer.

*My flesh is perfect*.

 

**THERE IS NO PAIN**

There is no pain nor inflammation.  
All fear is swept away in the realization of Truth.  
I am free from every belief in pain.  
The Spirit cannot pain, and I am Pure Spirit and cannot be hurt nor
harmed.

*I am free from all pain*.
