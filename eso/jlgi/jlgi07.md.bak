### CHAPTER V

### STRUGGLE WITH THE PHARISEES—FLIGHT TO CÆSAREA—THE TRANSFIGURATION

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> Galilean springtime, during which
the dawn of the Kingdom of Heaven seemed to rise upon the attentive
multitudes, lasted two years. Now, however, the sky darkened, sinister
flashes appeared, forerunners of catastrophe. The storm burst upon the
small family at Galilee like one of those tempests which sweep the lake
of Gennesareth, and in their wild fury engulf the fishermen's frail
barques. Jesus was in no way surprised at the consternation and terror
of his disciples, he fully expected it. It was impossible that his
preaching and increasing popularity should not stir the religious
authorities of the Jews, and just as impossible that the struggle should
not be a complete one between these authorities and himself. On the
contrary, from this conflict alone could light flash forth.

At the time of Jesus the Pharisees formed a compact body of six thousand
men. Their name Perishin means "separate" or "distinguished." Of a lofty
and often heroic though narrow and haughty patriotism, they represented
the party of national restoration; their existence dating back from the
Maccabees. They acknowledged both an oral and a written tradition. They
believed in angels, a future life and resurrection, but the glimpses of
esoterism which came to them from Persia

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

they buried beneath the darkness of a gross material interpretation.
Strict observers of the law, though quite opposed to the spirit of the
prophets who placed religion in the love of God and of men, they made
piety consist of rites and ceremonies, fasts and public penance. On
great occasions they were to be seen in the open streets, their faces
covered with soot, praying aloud with contrite mien, and ostentatiously
distributing alms. In contradistinction to all this they lived in
luxury, eagerly intriguing after authority and power. None the less were
they the chiefs of the democratic party, holding the people under their
control.

The Sadducees, on the other hand, represented the
[sacerdotal](errata.htm#9.md) and aristocratic party. They were composed of
families whose pretension it was to have exercised priesthood by
hereditary right ever since the time of David. Extreme in their
conservatism they rejected oral tradition, accepted nothing but the
letter of the law, and denied the existence of the soul and a future
life. They ridiculed alike the stormy practices of the Pharisees and
their extravagant beliefs. For them, religion consisted entirely in
sacerdotal ceremonies. Under the Seleucides they had deprived the
pontificate of power, as they were in complete accord with the pagans,
and were even imbued with Greek sophistry and refined Epicurism. Under
the Maccabees the Pharisees had been ejected from the pontificate,
though, under Herod and the Romans, they had apparently regained this
position. The Sadducees were stern and hard-hearted as men, and lovers
of good cheer as priests, possessed of one faith, that of their own
superiority, and of one idea, the determination to maintain the power
tradition had handed down to them.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

In such a religion what could Jesus find, Jesus the initiate, inheritor
of the prophets, the Seer of Engaddi, seeking in social order the image
of the divine, in which justice reigns over life, science over justice,
and love and wisdom over all three? … In the temple, instead of supreme
science and initiation, he found materialistic and agnostic ignorance,
playing on religion as on a power-giving instrument, in other words,
priestly imposture.… In schools and synagogues, instead of the bread of
life, and the dew from heaven falling upon men's hearts, he saw an
interested morality under the veneer of formal worship, *i. e.*
hypocrisy.… Far above, enthroned in a nimbus of glory, sat almighty
Cæsar, the apotheosis of evil and the deification of matter, the sole
god of the then world, only possible master of the Sadducees and
Pharisees, whether they wished it so or not. In adopting the idea from
Persian esoterism as did the prophets, was Jesus wrong in naming this
reign the dominion of Satan or Ahrimanes, *i. e.* the rule of matter
over spirit, in place of which he wished to substitute that of spirit
over matter? Like all great reformers, he attacked not men, who as
exceptions, might be excellent, but doctrines and institutions which
mold the majority of mankind. The challenge must be delivered, and war
declared against the existing powers.

The struggle began in the synagogues of Galilee and continued beneath
the porticos of the temple at Jerusalem, to which Jesus made lengthened
visits, preaching and replying to his opponents. In this as throughout
his whole career, he acted with that mixture of prudence and boldness,
meditative reserve and impetuous action, which characterized his
wonderfully well-balanced

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

nature. He did not take the offensive against his opponents, but waited
and replied to their attack, which never tarried, for, from the very
beginning of his ministry, the Pharisees had been jealous of him by
reason of his popularity and his healing of the sick. They quickly
suspected him to be their most dangerous enemy. Accosting him with that
mocking urbanity, that cunning malevolence, veiled beneath a mask of
hypocritical gentleness, in which they were past-masters, in their rôle
as learned doctors and men of importance and authority, they asked what
reasons he had for having dealings with publicans and sinners? Why did
his disciples dare to pluck ears of corn on the Sabbath day? Such
conduct constituted a grave violation of their regulations. With
magnanimous gentleness, Jesus replied in words at once tender and
courteous. He tried on them his gospel of love, spoke of the love of
God, who rejoice) more over one repentant sinner than over many just
persons. He related to them the parables of the lost sheep and of the
prodigal son. In embarrassed astonishment they held their peace. Uniting
again, they returned to the charge, reproaching him for healing the sick
on the Sabbath day. "Hypocrites!" replied Jesus, a flash of indignation
illumining his eyes, "do not you on the Sabbath day remove the chain
from your own oxen's neck and lead them away to the watering-trough? May
not therefore the daughter of Abraham be delivered this same day from
the chains of Satan?" No longer knowing what to reply, the Pharisees
accused him of casting out devils in the name of Beelzebub. With quite
as much wit as logical acumen, Jesus replied that the devil does not
cast himself out, adding that sin against the Son of Man will be
forgiven, but not sin against the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy Ghost,
signifying thereby that he attached slight importance to insults against
himself personally, but that a denial of the Good and the True, when
once established, constitutes intellectual perversity the supreme vice
and an irremediable evil. This was a declaration of war. He was called
Blasphemer! Agent of Beelzebub! which accusations he answered by the
expressions: Hypocrites! Generation of vipers! From this time the
struggle continually increased in bitterness. Jesus gave evidence of a
close incisive logic, his words lashed like whips and pierced like
arrows. He had changed tactics; instead of defending himself, he
attacked and replied to charges by other charges more vigorous still,
showing no pity for hypocrisy, the one vice at the root of all others.
"Why transgress ye the law of God by reason of your traditions? God
commanded, Honor thy father and thy mother; you dispense with honoring
parents, if, as alternative, money flows into the temple. With your lips
you serve Isaiah, but your devotion is devoid of heart."

Jesus ever kept perfect control over himself, though the enthusiasm and
greatness of the struggle daily increased. The more he was attacked, the
more emphatically did he proclaim himself as the Messiah. He began to
utter threats against the temple, to foretell the misfortunes that
Israel would undergo, to appeal to the heathen, and to say that the Lord
would send other laborers into his vineyard. Thereupon the Pharisees of
Jerusalem became anxious. [Seeing](errata.htm#10.md) they could neither
impose silence on him nor find any effective retort, they too changed
tactics. Their idea now was to ensnare him, so they sent deputations
whose object it was to induce him to utter heretical sayings which would
warrant the Sanhedrim in laying hands on him as a blasphemer,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

in the name of the law of Moses, or of having him condemned as a rebel
by the Roman governor. Hence the insidious question concerning the woman
taken in adultery, and the coin stamped with Cæsar's image. Ever
penetrating the designs of his enemies, Jesus, with profound psychology
and skilful strategy, disarmed them by his replies. Finding it
impossible to effect their object by these means, the Pharisees
attempted to intimidate him by annoying him at every turn. Worked upon
and excited by them, the majority of the people began to turn away from
Jesus when they saw that he was not restoring the kingdom of Israel.
Everywhere, even in the smallest of hamlets, he met suspicious and wily
countenances, spies, and treacherous emissaries to track and dishearten
him. Some came and said to him, "Depart from here, for Herod (Antipas)
is bent on killing thee." He replied proudly, "Go tell that fox; it
cannot be that a prophet die out of Jerusalem!" Nevertheless, he was
often obliged to cross the sea of Tiberias and take refuge on the
eastern bank in order to escape these snares. Nowhere was he now free
from danger. Meanwhile John the Baptist was put to death by order of
Antipas in the fortress of Makerous. It is said that Hannibal, on seeing
the head of his brother Hasdrubal, killed by the Romans, exclaimed: "Now
I recognize the fate of Carthage." Jesus could recognize his own fate in
the death of his precursor. He had had no doubt of this ever since his
vision at Engaddi; had begun his work, knowing the inevitable end, and
yet this news, when brought by the sorrow-stricken disciples of the
prophet of the wilderness, struck Jesus as a death-warning. He
exclaimed: "They did not recognize him, but have done with him

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

as they wished, thus shall the Son of Man stiffer at their hands."

The twelve were troubled and anxious; Jesus was hesitating on his
pathway. He did not wish to let himself be taken, but rather, once his
work finished, to offer himself of his own free will, and die as a
prophet at the hour he himself should choose. Already hunted down during
the whole of the past year, accustomed to escape from the enemy by
making marches and countermarches, disheartened with the people, whose
apathy, after days of enthusiasm, he was keenly conscious of, Jesus
determined once more to escape with his disciples. Reaching the summit
of a mountain, he turned around to cast one final lingering look on his
beloved lake, on whose banks he had wished the dawn of the Kingdom of
Heaven to shine. His eyes wandered over those towns lying by the
water-side, or rising tier upon tier along the mountain-side, half
buried in their verdant oases, and now glittering with white beneath the
golden veil of twilight; those beloved towns in which he had sown the
words of life, and which now abandoned him. A presentiment of the future
came over him. With prophetic vision he saw this splendid country
changed into a wilderness beneath the vengeful hand of Ishmael, and
those words, devoid of anger, though full of sorrow and bitterness, fell
from his lips: "Woe unto thee, Capernaum; woe unto thee, Chorazin; woe
unto thee, Bethsaida!" Then turning towards the heathen world,
accompanied by his disciples, he took the path leading along the Jordan
valley from Gadara to Cæsarea Philippi.

Sad and long was the route of the fugitive band across the mighty plain
of reeds and the marshes of the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

upper Jordan under the burning Syrian sun. The nights were passed
beneath the tents of shepherds, or with such Essenes as were living in
the small hamlets of this abandoned country. The anxious disciples
proceeded with downcast eyes; the master, filled with sorrow, remained
plunged in silent meditation. He was reflecting on the impossibility of
the triumph of his doctrine by preaching to the people, and on the
unremitting plottings of his enemies. The final struggle was becoming
imminent, he had reached a terrible difficulty; how was he to escape? On
the other hand, his thoughts dwelt with anxiety on his spiritual family
now scattered abroad, and especially on the twelve apostles, who, in
faith and trust, had left everything—family, profession, and fortune—to
follow him, and who, in spite of all, would soon be heartbroken and
deceived in their mighty hope of a triumphant Messiah. Could he leave
them to themselves? Had the truth sufficiently penetrated their souls?
Would they believe in him, and in his doctrine, at all events? Did they
know who he was? Dominated by this thought, he one day asked them: "Whom
say men that I, the Son of Man, am?" They replied: "Some say that thou
art John the Baptist, some Elias, and other Jeremias, or one of the
prophets." Then Jesus said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?" Simon
Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God." <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

In the mouth of Peter, and the thought of Jesus, these words have not
the signification the Church at a later date wished to give them: "Thou
art the Elect of Israel announced by the prophets." In the Hindoo, the
Egyptian, and the Greek initiation, the term "Son of

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God" signified "a
consciousness identified with divine truth, a will capable of
manifesting it." According to the prophets, this Messiah must be the
greatest of these manifestations. He would be the Son of Man, *i. e.*,
the Elect of earthly Humanity; the Son of God, *i. e.*, the Envoy of
heavenly Humanity, and as such having in himself the Father or Spirit,
who, by Humanity, reigns over the universe.

At this affirmation of the faith of the apostles Jesus felt an immense
joy. So his disciples had understood him; he would live in them, and the
bond between heaven and earth would be re-established. Jesus said to
Peter, "Happy art thou, Simon Barjona, for flesh and blood hath not
revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." By this reply
Jesus gives Peter to understand that he considers him as an initiate, as
he himself was, and also possessed of a deep insight into truth. This is
the true, the only revelation, this is "the stone on which the Christ
wishes to build his Church, and against which the gates of hell shall
not prevail." Jesus relies on the Apostle Peter only in so far as he
shall have this intuition. A moment later, the apostle reverting to the
ordinary, fear-stricken Peter, the Master treats him in quite a
different fashion. Jesus had announced to his disciples that he was
about to be put to death at Jerusalem, and Peter protested with the
words, "Be it far from thee, Lord, this shall not be unto thee!" But
Jesus, as though seeing a temptation of the flesh in this impulse of
sympathy, attempting to shake his mighty resolution, turned sharply
round to the apostle and said: "Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an
offense unto me, for thou savorest not the things that be of God, but
those that be of men" (Matt. xvi. 21-23).

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the Master's
imperious gesture seemed to say, "Forward through the desert!"
Intimidated by his solemn voice and stern look, the apostles bowed their
heads in silence, and resumed their journey over the stone hills of the
Gaulonitide. This flight, by which Jesus brought his disciples out of
Israel, resembled a march towards the problem of his Messianic destiny,
the key to which he was seeking.

They reached the gates of Cæsarea. That town, which had become pagan
since the time of Antiochus the Great, was sheltered within a verdant
oasis near the Jordan's source, at the foot of Hermon's snowy peaks. It
had its amphitheater, and was resplendent with costly palaces and
Grecian temples. Jesus crossed it, and continued to the spot at which
the Jordan in a clear bubbling stream issues from a mountain cavern,
like the stream of life springing from the profound bosom of nature.
There was erected a small temple dedicated to Pan; and in the grotto, on
the banks of the stream, numerous columns, marble nymphs, and pagan
divinities. The Jews held in horror these tokens of idolatrous worship;
Jesus contemplated them with an indulgent smile. In them lie recognized
the imperfect effigies of the divine beauty, whose radiant models he
bore within his own soul. He had not come to utter maledictions against
paganism, hut to transform it; not to scatter anathema on earth and its
mysterious powers, but to point out to it the way to heaven. His heart
was large enough, and his doctrine sufficiently vast, to embrace all
people, and to say to men of every religion: "Raise your heads, and
learn that you all have one same father." And yet, there he was at the
extreme limit of Israel, hunted like a wild beast, stifled between two
peoples who rejected him

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

alike. In front, the heathens who did not yet understand him, and on
whom his words fell powerless; behind, the Jews, a people which stoned
his prophets, and stopped its ears, so as not to hear its Messiah; while
all the time the Pharisees and Sadducees were watching their prey. What
superhuman courage, what unprecedented power of action would be needed
to crush all these obstacles, to penetrate beyond heathen idolatry and
Jewish harshness right to the heart of that suffering humanity he loved
with every fiber of his being, and induce it to listen to his
resurrection message! Then suddenly his mind went back to bygone times,
descending once again the stream of the Jordan, Israel's sacred river,
passing from the temple of Pan to that of Jerusalem, measuring the
distance which separated ancient paganism from the universal prophetic
thought, and, regaining its source, as an eagle its nest, returned from
the anguish of Cæsarea to the vision of Engaddi! And now, from the
depths of the Dead Sea, he sees this terrible phantom of the cross once
more spring forth! … Had the hour of the great sacrifice at length come?
Jesus, like all men, possessed two consciousnesses; the earthly one
lulled him with illusions, saying: "Who knows? Perhaps I shall escape
this destiny." The other, the divine one, repeated implacably: "The path
of victory passes through the gate of anguish." Must he choose this
latter voice?

At all important epochs in his life we see Jesus withdraw to the
mountain to pray. Had not the Vedic sage said, "Prayer upholds heaven
and rules the Gods?" Jesus knew this greatest of all forces. Usually he
admitted of no companion in this mountain solitude when he descended
into the inmost elements of his being.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

This time, however, he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee,
James and John, to spend the night on the summit of a lofty mountain.
Legend states this to have been Mount Tabor. There, between the Master
and three of the greatest initiates among the disciples, the mysterious
scene related in the Gospels under the name of the *Transfiguration*
took place! According to Matthew, the apostles saw the Master's form,
luminous and apparently diaphanous, appear in the transparent penumbra
of the Eastern night. His face shone like the sun, and his garments
became brilliant as the light; at his side appeared two figures, which
they took for those of Moses and Elijah. As, trembling, they emerged
from their strange prostration, which seemed to them at once a
profounder sleep and a more intense waking state, they saw the Master
alone by their side, restoring them to full consciousness by his touch.
The transfigured Christ they had contemplated in this dream was never
effaced from their memory (Matt. xvii. 1-8).

But what had Jesus himself seen and passed through during that night
which preceded the most decisive act of his prophetic career? A gradual
effacing of earthly things, beneath the ardor of prayer, a rapturous
ascent from sphere to sphere, he seemed by degrees to be returning along
the depths of his consciousness into some previous existence, an
altogether spiritual and divine one. Far in the distance were suns,
worlds, earths, vortices of suffering incarnations; now he was conscious
of one homogeneous atmosphere, one fluid substance, one intelligent
light. Within this radiance legions of celestial beings form a moving
vault, a firmament of ethereal bodies, white as snow, whence beam

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

forth gentle flashes of light. On the shining cloud where he was
standing six men in priestly robes, and mighty of stature, raise aloft,
with joined hands, a dazzling Chalice. These are the six Messiahs who
have already appeared on earth; the seventh is himself, and this Cup
signifies the Sacrifice he must undergo, by incarnating himself on earth
in his turn. Beneath the cloud is heard the roar of thunder; there yawns
a black abyss; the circle of generations, the pit of life and death, the
terrestrial hell. The Sons of God with suppliant gesture raise the Cup,
the very firmament of heaven is silent, as Jesus, in token of assent,
extends his arms in the form of a cross as though he wished to embrace
the whole universe. Then the Sons of God bow down their faces to the
earth, a band of female angels, with outspread wings and downcast eyes,
carry off the incandescent Chalice towards the vault of light. The
hosanna resounds, with ineffably melodious strains, throughout the
heavens.… But he, without even listening to it, plunges into the pit.…

This is what had taken place long ago among the Essenes, in the bosom of
the Father, where the mysterious rites of Eternal Love are celebrated
and the revolutions of the constellations pass, light as waves. This is
what he had sworn to accomplish, this is the reason of his birth and the
purpose of his past struggles. And now, once more this mighty oath bound
him down at the end of his task.

Terrible oath, dreaded chalice! Still, it must be drained to the dregs.
After all this rapturous bliss he awoke in the depths of the pit, on the
brink of martyrdom. No further doubt was possible; the time was at

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

hand. Heaven had spoken and Earth cried aloud for help.

Retracing his steps, Jesus once again descended the valley of the
Jordan, and proceeded by slow stages along the road to Jerusalem.
