### PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION, 1890.

<span class="smallcaps">Seven</span> years have passed since this essay
was written, and the MSS. pages have been lent to many friends and
students of mystic lore and occult meanings. It is only at the earnest
request of these kindly critics that I have consented to publish this
volume. The contents are necessarily of a fragmentary character, and
have been collected from an immense number of sources; the original
matter has been intentionally reduced to the least possible quantity, so
as to obtain space for the inclusion of the utmost amount of ancient,
quaint and occult learning. It is impossible to give even an approximate
list of works which have been consulted; direct quotations have been
acknowledged in numerous instances, and (perhaps naturally) many a
statement might have been equally well quoted from the book of a
contemporary author, a mediæval monk, a Roman historian, a Greek poet,
or a Hindoo Adept: to give the credit to the modern author would not be
fair to the ancient sage, to refer the reader to a Sanskrit tome would
be in most cases only loss of time and waste of paper. My great
difficulty has been to supply information mystic enough to match the
ideal of the work, and yet not so esoteric as to convey truths which
Adepts have still concealed.

I must apologise for the barbarous appearance of foreign words, but it
was not found practicable to supply Sanskrit, Coptic, Chaldee and Greek
type, so the words have had

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

to be transliterated. Hebrew and Chaldee should of course be read from
right to left, and it was at first intended so to print them in their
converted form, but the appearance of Hebrew in English letters reversed
was too grotesque; ADNI is a representation of the Aleph, daleth, nun,
yod, of "Adonai," but INDA would have been sheer barbarity: in the case
of Hebrew words I have often added the pronunciation.

The "Secret Doctrine" of H. P. Blavatsky, a work of erudition containing
a vast fund of archaic doctrine, has supplied me with valuable
quotations. If any readers desire a deeper insight into the analogies
between numbers and ideas, I refer them in addition to the works of
Eliphaz Lévi, Athanasius Kircher, Godfrey Higgins, Michael Maier, and
John Heydon; I have quoted from each of these authorities, and Thomas
Taylor's "Theoretic Arithmetic" has supplied me with a great part of the
purely arithmetical notions of the Pythagoreans, the elucidation of
which was mainly due to him. In conclusion, I request my readers,—
