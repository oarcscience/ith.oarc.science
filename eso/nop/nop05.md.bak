### PART II.

### PYTHAGOREAN VIEWS ON NUMBERS.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> foundation of Pythagorean Mathematics
was as follows:

The first natural division of Numbers is into EVEN and ODD, an EVEN
number being one which is divisible into two equal parts, without
leaving a monad between them. The ODD number, when divided into two
equal parts, leaves the monad in the middle between the parts.

All even numbers also (except the dyad—two—which is simply two unities)
may be divided into two equal parts, and also into two unequal parts,
yet so that in neither division will either parity be mingled with
imparity, nor imparity with parity. The binary number two cannot be
divided into two unequal parts.

Thus io divides into 5 and 5, equal parts, also into 3 and 7, both
imparities, and into 6 and 4, both parities; and 8 divides into 4 and 4,
equals and parities, and into 5 and 3, both imparities.

But the ODD number is only divisible into uneven parts, and one part is
also a parity and the other part an imparity; thus 7 into 4 and 3, or 5
and 2, in both cases unequal, and odd and even.

The ancients also remarked the monad to be "odd," and to be the first
"odd number," because it cannot be divided into two equal numbers.
Another reason they saw was that the monad, added to an even number,
became an odd number, but if evens are added to evens the result is an
even number.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

Aristotle, in his Pythagoric treatise, remarks that the monad partakes
also of the nature of the even number, because when added to the odd it
makes the even, and added to the even the odd is formed.

Hence it is called "evenly odd." Archytas of Tarentum was of the same
opinion.

The Monad, then, is the first idea of the odd number; and so the
Pythagoreans speak of the "two" as the "first idea of the indefinite
dyad," and attribute the number 2 to that which is indefinite, unknown,
and inordinate in the world; just as they adapt the monad to all that is
definite and orderly. They noted also that in the series of numbers from
unity, the terms are increased each by the monad once added, and so
their ratios to each other are lessened; thus 2 is 1 + 1, or double its
predecessor; 3 is not double 2, but 2 and the monad, sesquialter; 4 to 3
is 3 and the monad, and the ratio is sesquitertian; the sesquiquintan 6
to 5 is less also than its forerunner, the sesquiquartan 5 and 4, and so
on through the series.

They also noted that every number is one half of the total of the
numbers about it, in the natural series; thus 5 is half of 6 and 4. And
also of the sum of the numbers again above and below this pair; thus 5
is also half of 7 and 3, and so on till unity is reached; for the monad
alone has not two terms, one below and one above; it has one above it
only, and hence it is said to be the "source of all multitude."

"Evenly even" is another term applied anciently to one sort of even
numbers. Such are those which divide into two equal parts, and each part
divides evenly, and the even division is continued until unity is
reached; such a number is 64. These numbers form a series, in a duple
ratio from unity; thus 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. "Evenly odd," applied to an
even number, points out that like 6, so, 14, and 28, when divided into
two equal parts, these are found to be indivisible into equal parts. A
series of these numbers is formed by doubling the items of a series of
odd numbers, thus:

1, 3, 5, 7, 9 produce 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Unevenly even numbers may be parted into two equal divisions, and these
parts again equally divided, but the process does not proceed until
unity is reached; such numbers are 24 and 28.

Odd numbers also are susceptible of being looked upon from three points
of view, thus:

"First and incomposite"; such are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, 31; no
other number measures them but unity; they are not composed of other
numbers, but are generated from unity alone.

"Second and composite" are indeed "odd," but contain and are composed
from other numbers; such are 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 33, and 39. These have
parts which are denominated from a foreign number, or word, as well as
proper unity, thus 9 has a third part which is 3; 15 has a third part
which is 5; and a fifth part 3; hence as containing a foreign part, it
is called second, and as containing a divisibility, it is composite.

The Third Variety of odd numbers is more complex, and is of itself
second and composite, but with reference to another is first and
incomposite; such are 9 and 25. These are divisible, each of them that
is second and composite, yet have no common measure; thus 3 which
divides the 9 does not divide the 25.

Odd numbers are sorted out into these three classes by a device, called
the "Sieve of Eratosthenes," which is of too complex a nature to form
part of a monograph so discursive as this must be.

Even numbers have also been divided by the ancient sages into Perfect,
Deficient and Superabundant.

Superperfect or Superabundant are such as 12 and 24.

Deficient are such as 8 and 14.

Perfect are such as 6 and 28; equal to the number of their parts; as
28—half is 14, a fourth is 7, a seventh is 4, a fourteenth part is 2,
and the twenty-eighth is 1, which quotients added together are 28.

In Deficient numbers, such as 14, the parts are surpassed

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

by the whole: one seventh is 2, a half is 7, a fourteenth is 1; the
aggregate is 10, or less than 14.

In Superabundant, as 12, the whole surpasses the aggregate of its parts;
thus the sixth is 2, a fourth is 3, a third is 4, a half is 6, and a
twelfth is 1; and the aggregate is 16, or more than 12.

Superperfect numbers they looked on as similar to Briareus, the
hundred-handed giant: his parts were too numerous; the deficient numbers
resembled Cyclops, who had but one eye; whilst the perfect numbers have
the temperament of a middle limit, and are the emulators of Virtue, a
medium between excess and defect, not the summit, as some ancients
falsely thought.

Evil is indeed opposed to evil, but both to one good. Good, however, is
never opposed to good, but to two evils.

The Perfect numbers are also like the virtues, few in number; whilst the
other two classes are like the vices—numerous, inordinate, and
indefinite.

There is but one perfect number between 1 and 10, that is 6; only one
between 10 and 100, that is 28; only one between 100 and 1000, that is
496; and between 1000 and 10,000 only one, that is 8128.

Odd numbers they called Gnomons, because, being added to squares, they
keep the same figures as in Geometry: see Simplicius, liber 3.

A number which is formed by the multiplication of an odd and an even
number together they called Hermaphrodite, or "arrenothelus."

In connection with these notes on parity and imparity, definite and
indefinite numbers, it is to be noted that the old philosophers were
deeply imbued with the union of numerical ideas with Nature—in its
common acceptation, and also to the natures, essences or substrata of
things.

The nature of good to them was definite, that of evil indefinite; and
the more indefinite the nature of the evil, the worse it was. Goodness
alone can define or bound the indefinite. In the human soul exists a
certain vestige of

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

divine goodness (Buddhi); this bounds and moderates the indefiniteness
and inequality of its desires.

It may be demonstrated that all inequality arises from equality, so that
obtaining, as it were, the power of a mother and a root, she pours forth
with exuberant fertility all sorts of inequality; and did space and time
allow, it could be also shown that all inequality may be reduced to
equality.

Iamblichus, in his treatise on the Arithmetic of Nicomachus, throws
another light on numbers; he says some are like friends, they are
Amicable numbers, as 284 and 220.

Pythagoras, being asked what a friend was, said ἐτερος εγω = "another
I." Now this is demonstrated to be the case in these numbers; the parts
of each are generative of each other, according to the nature of
friendship.

Ozanam, a French mathematician, A.D. 1710, gives examples in his
"Mathematical Recreations" of such Amicable Numbers. He remarks that 220
is equal to the sum of the aliquot parts of 284; thus 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 +
142 = 220: and 284 is equal to the sum of the aliquot parts of 220; thus
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284.

Another such pair of numbers are 17,296 and 18,416.

Very curious speculations as to the relation between Numbers and
marriage, and the character of offspring from it, are to be found
scattered through the writings of the Philosophers. Plato, in his
"Republic," has a passage concerning a geometric number, which, divinely
generated, will be fortunate or unfortunate. Nicomachus also speaks of
this same number, and he calls it the Nuptial Number; and he passes from
it to state that from two good parents only good offspring can come;
from two bad parents only bad; and from a good and a bad parent only
bad; whence he warns the Republic against wedlock in a confused or
disorderly manner, from which, the progeny being depraved, discord will
result. Simplicius, in his commentary on the 2nd Book of Aristotle, "On
the Heavens," remarks that Pythagoras and his followers claimed to have
heard the Music of the Spheres, to have heard an harmonic sound produced
by the motion of the planets, and from the sound

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

to have calculated by numbers the ratio of distance and size of the Sun,
Moon, Venus and Mercury. To this Aristotle objected, but perhaps the
difficulty might be solved: in this sublunary sphere all things are not
commensurate, nor is everything sensible to every body alike. Animals
can be scented, and their presence definitely known, by dogs when at
great distances from them, and when man is in complete ignorance of
their existence. Some of the ancients thought the soul had three
vehicles—the terrestrial body, an aerial one in which it is punished,
and an ethereal one, luminous and celestial, in which the soul abides
when in a state of bliss. It may be that some one, by purification of
the senses, by hereditary magical power, or by probity, or by the sacred
operations of his religion, may perceive, with a terrestrial body laid
aside, things imperceptible to us, and hear sounds inaudible to us still
in bondage; or with mantle partly unfolded, some adept or truth-seeker
may perceive, with eyes upraised, sights invisible to mortals, whilst
yet his ears are deaf to the sounds beyond us both. For why do we see
the stars, while yet we hear not their motion:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why come not angels from the realms of glory  
To visit earth, as in the days of old?  
Is heaven more distant  
Or has earth grown cold?
