### SOME HINDOO USES OF NUMBERS.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> ancient India, in the Sanscrit
language, certain words were used as equivalent to the low numbers: for
One they said Moon or Earth: for Two they used many words of things in
pairs such as eye, wing, arm: for Three they used Rama, fire or guna,
for they knew of 3 Ramas, 3 kinds of fire and 3 gunas or qualities: for
4 they used Veda, age or ocean: for 6 they used Seasons: for 7 they used
Sage or vowel: for 12 they said Sun or Zodiac; and for 20 they used
nails, meaning those of hands and feet. Edward B. Tylor.
