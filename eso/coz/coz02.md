### INTRODUCTION

### By L. O.

IT has been believed by many, and not without good reason, that these
terse and enigmatic utterances enshrine a profound system of mystical
philosophy, but that this system demands for its full discernment a
refinement of faculty, involving, as it does, a discrete perception of
immaterial essences.

It has been asserted that the Chaldæan Magi <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3) preserved their occult learning among their
race by continual tradition from Father to Son. Diodorus says: "They
learn these things, not after the same fashion as the Greeks: for
amongst the Chaldæans, philosophy is delivered by tradition in the
family, the Son receiving it from his Father, being exempted from all
other employment; and thus having their parents for their teachers, they
learn all things fully and abundantly, believing more firmly what is
communicated to them." <span id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4)

The remains then of this oral tradition seems to exist in these Oracles,
which should be studied in the light of the Kabalah and of Egyptian
Theology. Students are aware that the Kabalah <span
id="fr_5"></span>[‡](#fn_5) is susceptible

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

of extraordinary interpretation with the aid of the Tarot, resuming as
the latter does, the very roots of Egyptian Theology. Had a similar
course been adopted by commentators in the past, the Chaldæan system
expounded in these Oracles would not have been distorted in the way it
has been.

The foundation upon which the whole structure of the Hebrew Kabalah
rests is an exposition of ten deific powers successively emanated by the
Illimitable Light, which in their varying dispositions are considered as
the key of all things. This divine procession in the form of Three
Triads of Powers, synthesized in a tenth, is said to be extended through
four worlds, denominated respectively Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah and
Assiah, a fourfold gradation from the subtil to the gross. This
proposition in its metaphysical roots is pantheistic, though, if it may
be so stated, mediately theistic; while the ultimate noumenon of all
phenomena is the absolute Deity, whose ideation constitutes the
objective Universe.

Now these observations apply strictly also to the Chaldæan system.

The accompanying diagrams sufficiently indicate the harmony and identity
of the Chaldæan philosophy with the Hebrew Kabalah. It will be seen that
the First Mind and the *Intelligible Triad*, Pater, Potentia, or Mater,
and Mens, are allotted to the Intelligible World of Supramundane Light:
the "First Mind" represents the archetypal intelligence as an entity in
the bosom of the Paternal Depth. This concentrates by reflection into
the "Second Mind " representative of the Divine Power in the Empyræan
World which is identified with the second great Triad of divine powers,
known as *the Intelligible and at the same time Intellectual Triad:* the
Æthereal World comprises the dual third Triad denominated
*Intellectual:* while the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

fourth or Elementary World is governed by Hypezokos, or Flower of Fire,
the actual builder of the world.

Chaldæan Theology contemplated three great divisions of supra-mundane
things:--the First was *Eternal*, without beginning or end, being the
"Paternal Depth," the bosom of the Deity. The Second was conceived to be
that mode of being having beginning but no end; the Creative World or
Empyræum falls under this head, abounding as it does in productions, but
its source remaining superior to these. The third and last order of
divine things had a beginning in time and will end, this is the
transitory Ethereal World. Seven spheres extended through these three
Worlds, *viz*., one in the Empyræum or

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

verging from it, three in the Ethereal and three in the Elementary
Worlds, while the whole physical realm synthesized the foregoing. These
seven spheres are not to be confounded with the Seven material Planets;
although the latter are the physical representatives of the former,
which can only be said to be material in the metaphysical sense of the
term. Psellus professed to identify them but his suggestions are
inadequate as Stanley pointed out. But Stanley, although disagreeing
with Psellus, is nevertheless inconsistent upon this point, for although
he explains the four -Worlds of the Chaldæans as successively noumenal
to the physical realm, he obviously contradicts this in saying that one
*corporeal* world is in the Empyræum.

Prior to the supramundane Light lay the "Paternal Depth," the Absolute
Deity, containing all things "*in potentia*" and eternally immanent.
This is analogous to the Ain Suph Aur of the Kabalah, three words of
three letters, expressing three triads of Powers, which are subsequently
translated into objectivity, and constitute the great Triadic Law sunder
the direction of the Demiurgus, or artificer of the Universe.

In considering this schema, it must be remembered that the supramundane
Light was regarded as the primal radiation from the Paternal Depth and
the archetypal noumenon of the Empyræum, a universal,
all-pervading--and, to human comprehension--ultimate essence. The
Empyræum again, is a somewhat grosser though still highly subtilized
Fire and creative source, in its turn the noumenon of the Formative or
Ethereal World, as the latter is the noumenon of the Elementary World.
Through these graduated media the conceptions of the Paternal Mind are
ultimately fulfilled in time and space.

In some respects it is probable that the Oriental mind     day is not
much altered from what it was

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

thousands of years ago, and much that now appears to us curious and
phantastic in Eastern traditions, still finds responsive echo in the
hearts and minds of a vast portion of mankind. A large number of
thinkers and scientists in modern times have advocated tenets which,
while not exactly similar, are parallel to ancient Chaldæan conceptions;
this is exemplified in the notion that the operation of natural law in
the Universe is controlled or operated by conscious and discriminating
power which is co-ordinate with intelligence. It is but one step further
to admit that forces are entities, to people the vast spaces of the
Universe with the children of phantasy. Thus history repeats itself, and
the old and the new alike reflect the multiform truth.

Without entering at length into the metaphysical aspect, it is important
to notice the supremacy attributed to the "Paternal Mind." The
intelligence of the Universe, poetically described as "energising before
energy," establishes on high the primordial types or patterns of things
which are to be, and, then inscrutably latent, vests the development of
these in the *Rectores Mundorum*, the divine Regents or powers already
referred to. As it is said, "Mind is with Him, power with them."

The word "Intelligible" is used in the Platonic sense, to denote a mode
of being, power or perception, transcending intellectual comprehension,
*i.e.*, wholly distinct from, and superior to, ratiocination. The
Chaldæans recognised three modes of perception, *viz*., the testimony of
the various senses, the ordinary processes of intellectual activity, and
the intelligible conceptions before referred to. Each of these
operations is distinct from the others, and, moreover, conducted in
separate matrices, or vehicula. The anatomy of the Soul was, however,
carried much farther than this, and, although in its ultimate radix

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

recognised as identical with the divinity, yet in manifested being it
was conceived to be highly complex. The Oracles speak of the "Paths of
the Soul," the tracings of inflexible fire by which its essential parts
are associated in integrity; while its various "summits," "fountains,"
and "vehicula," are all traceable by analogy with universal principles:
This latter fact is, indeed, not the least remarkable feature of the
Chaldæan system. Like several of the ancient cosmogonies, the principal
characteristic of which seems to have been a certain adaptability to
introversion, Chaldæan metaphysics synthesize most clearly in the human
constitution.

In each of the Chaldæan Divine Worlds a trinity of divine powers
operated, which synthetically constituted a fourth term. "In every
World," says the Oracle, "a Triad shineth, of which the Monad is the
ruling principle." These "Monads " are the divine Vice-gerents by which
the Universe was conceived to be administered. Each of the four Worlds,
*viz*., the Empyræan, Ethereal, Elementary and Material, was presided
over by a Supreme Power, itself in direct *rapport* with "the Father"
and "moved by unspeakable counsels." These are clearly identical with
the Kabalistic conception of the presidential heads of the four letters
composing the Deity name in so many different languages. A parallel
tenet is conveyed in the Oracle which runs: "There is a Venerable Name
projected through the Worlds with a sleepless revolution." The Kabalah
again supplies the key to this utterance, by regarding the Four Worlds
as under the presidency of the four letters of the Venerable Name, a
certain letter of the four being allotted to each World, as also was a
special mode of writing the four-lettered name appropriate thereto; and,
indeed in that system it is taught that the order of the Elements, both
macrocosmic and microcosmic, on every plane,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

is directly controlled by the "revolution of the name." That Name is
associated with the Æthers of the Elements and is thus considered as a
Universal Law; it is the power which marshals the creative host, summed
up in the Demiurgus, Hypezokos, or Flower of Fire.

Reference may here be made to the psychic anatomy of the human being
according to Plato. He places the intellect in the head; the Soul
endowed with some of the passions, such as fortitude, in the heart;
while another Soul, of which the appetites, desires and grosser passions
are its faculties, about the stomach and the spleen.

So, the Chaldæan doctrine as recorded by Psellus, considered man to be
composed of three kinds of Souls, which may respectively be called:

First, the Intelligible, or divine soul,

Second, the Intellect or rational soul, and

Third, the Irrational, or passional soul.

This latter was regarded as subject to mutation, to be dissolved and
perish at the death of the body.

Of the Intelligible, or divine soul, the Oracles teach that "It is a
bright fire, which, by the power of the Father, remaineth immortal, and
is Mistress of Life;" its power may be dimly apprehended through
regenerate phantasy and when the sphere of the Intellect has ceased to
respond to the images of the passional nature.

Concerning the rational soul, the Chaldæans taught that it was possible
for it to assimilate itself unto the divinity on the one hand, or the
irrational soul on the other. "Things divine," we read, "cannot be
obtained by mortals whose intellect is directed to the body alone, but
those only who are stripped of their garments, arrive at the summit."

To the three Souls to which reference has been made, the Chaldæans
moreover allotted three distinct

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

vehicles: that of the divine Soul was immortal, that of the rational
soul by approximation became so; while to the irrational soul was
allotted what was called "the image," that is. the astral form of the
physical body.

Physical life thus integrates three special modes of activity, which
upon the dissolution of the body are respectively involved in the web of
fate consequent upon incarnate energies in three-different destinies.

The Oracles urge men to devote themselves to things divine, and not to
give way to the promptings of the irrational soul, for, to such as fail
herein, it is significantly said, "Thy vessel the beasts of the earth
shall inhabit."

The Chaldæans assigned the place of the Image, the vehicle of the
irrational soul, to the Lunar Sphere; it is probable that by the Lunar
Sphere was meant something more than the orb of the Moon, the whole
sublunary region, of which the terrestrial earth is, as it were, the
centre. At death, the rational Soul rose above the lunar influence,
provided always the past permitted that happy release. Great importance
was attributed to the way in which the physical life was passed during
the sojourn of the Soul in the tenement of flesh, and frequent are the
exhortations to rise to communion with those Divine powers, to which
nought but the highest Theurgy can pretend.

"Let the immortal depth of your Soul lead you," says an Oracle, "but
earnestly raise your eyes upwards." Taylor comments upon this in the
following beautiful passage: "By the eyes are to be understood all the
gnostic powers of the Soul, for when these are extended the Soul becomes
replete with a more excellent life and divine illumination; and is, as
it were, raised above itself."

Of the Chaldæan Magi it might be truly said that they "among dreams did
first discriminate the truthful

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

vision!" for they were certainly endowed with a far reaching perception
both mental and spiritual; attentive to images, and fired with mystic
fervours, they were something more than mere theorists, but were also
practical exemplars of the philosophy they taught. Life on the plains of
Chaldæa, with its mild nights and jewelled skies, tended to foster the
interior unfoldment; in early life the disciples of the Magi learnt to
resolve the Bonds of proscription and enter the immeasurable region. One
Oracle assures us that, "The girders of the Soul, which give her
breathing, are easy to be unloosed," and elsewhere we read of the
"Melody of the Ether" and of the "Lunar clashings," experiences which
testify to the reality of their occult methods.

The Oracles assert that the impressions of characters and other divine
visions appear in the Ether. The Chaldæan philosophy recognized the
ethers of the Elements as the subtil media through which the operation
of the grosser elements is effected--by the grosser elements I mean what
we know as Earth, Air, Water and Fire--the principles of dryness and
moisture, of heat and cold. These subtil ethers are really the elements
of the ancients, and seen at an early period to have been connected with
the Chaldæan astrology, as the signs of the Zodiac were connected with
them. The twelve signs of the Zodiac are permutations of the ethers of
the elements--four elements with three variations each; and according to
the preponderance of one or another elemental condition in the
constitution of the individual, so were his natural inclinations deduced
therefrom. Thus when in the astrological jargon it was said that a man
had Aries rising, he was said to be of a fiery nature, his natural
tendencies being active, energetic and fiery, for in the constitution of
such a one the fiery ether predominates. And these ethers were

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

stimulated, or endowed with a certain kind of vibration, by their
Presidents, the Planets; these latter being thus suspended in orderly
disposed zones. Unto the Planets, too, colour and sound were also
attributed;, the planetary colours are connected with the ethers, and
each of the Planetary forces was said to have special dominion over, or
affinity with, one or other of the Zodiacal constellations. Communion
with the hierarchies of these constellations formed part of the Chaldæan
theurgy, and in a curious fragment it is said: "If thou often invokest
it" (the celestial constellation called the Lion) "then when no longer
is visible unto thee the Vault of the Heavens, when the Stars have lost
their light the lamp of the Moon is veiled, the Earth abideth not, and
around thee darts the lightning flame, then all things will appear to
thee in the form of a Lion!" The Chaldæans, like the Egyptians, appear
to have had a highly developed appreciation of colours, an evidence of
their psychic susceptibility. The use of bright colours engenders the
recognition of subsisting variety and stimulates that perception of the
mind which energizes through imagination, or the operation of images.
The Chaldæan method of Contemplation appears to have been to identify
the self with the object of contemplation; this is of course identical
with the process of Indian Yoga, and is an idea which appears replete
with suggestion; as it is written, "He assimilates the images to
himself, casting them around his own form." But we are told, "All divine
natures are incorporeal, but bodies are bound in them for your sakes."

The subtil ethers, of which I have spoken, served in their turn as it
were for the garment of the divine Light; for the Oracles teach that
beyond these again " A solar world and endless Light subsist! " This
Divine Light was the object of all veneration. Do not think

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

that what was intended thereby was the Solar Light we know: "The
inerratic sphere of the Starless above" is an unmistakable expression
and therein "the more true Sun " has place: Theosophists will appreciate
the significance of "the more true Sun," for according to *The Secret
Doctrine* the Sun we see is but the physical vehicle of a more
transcendent splendour.

Some strong Souls were able to reach up to the Light by their own power:
"The mortal who approaches the fire shall have Light from the divinity,
and unto the persevering mortal the blessed immortals are swift." But
what of those of a lesser stature? Were they, by inability, precluded
from such illumination? "Others," we read, "even when asleep, He makes
fruitful from his own Strength." That is to say, some men acquire divine
knowledge through communion with Divinity in sleep. This idea has given
rise to some of the most magnificent contributions to later literature;
it has since been thoroughly elaborated by Porphyry and Synesius. The
eleventh Book of the *Metamorphoses* of Apuleius and the *Vision of
Scipio* ably vindicate this; and, although no doubt every Christian has
heard that "He giveth unto his beloved in sleep," few, indeed, realise
the possibility underlying that conception.

What, it may be asked, were the views of the Chaldæans with respect to
terrestrial life: Was it a spirit of pessimism, which led them to hold
this in light esteem? Or, should we not rather say that the keynote of
their philosophy was an immense spiritual optimism? It appears to me
that the latter is the more true interpretation. They realised that
beyond the confines of matter lay a more perfect existence, a truer
realm of which terrestrial administration is but a too often travestied
reflection. They sought, as we seek now, the Good, the Beautiful and the
True, but

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

they did not hasten to the Outer in the thirst for sensation, but with a
finer perception realised the true Utopia to be within.

And the first step in that admirable progress was a return to the simple
life; hardly, indeed, a return, for most of the Magi were thus brought
up from birth. <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6) The hardihood
engendered by the rugged life, coupled with that wisdom which directed
their association, rendered these children of Nature peculiarly
receptive of Nature's Truths. "Stoop not down," says the Oracle, "to the
darkly splendid World, For a precipice lieth beneath the Earth, a
descent of seven steps, and therein is established the throne of an evil
and fatal force. Stoop not down unto that darkly splendid world, Defile
not thy brilliant flame with the earthly dross of matter, Stoop not down
for its splendour is but seeming, It is but the habitation of the Sons
of the Unhappy." No more beautiful formulation of the Great Truth that
the exterior and sensuous life is death to the highest energies of the
Soul could possibly have been uttered: but to such as by purification
and the practice of virtue rendered themselves. worthy, encouragement
was given, for, we read, "The Higher powers build up the body of the
holy man."

The law of Karma was as much a feature of the Chaldæan philosophy as it
is of the Theosophy of today: from a passage in *Ficinus*, we read, "The
Soul perpetually runs and passes through all things in a certain space
of time, which being performed it is presently compelled to pass back
again through all things and unfold a similar web of generation in the
World, according to Zoroaster, who thinks that as often as the same
causes return, the same effects will in like manner return."

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

This is of course the explanation of the proverb that "History repeats
itself," and is very far from the superstitious view of fate. Here each
one receives his deserts according to merit or demerit, and these are
the bonds of life; but the Oracles say, "Enlarge not thy destiny," and
they urge men to "Explore the River of the Soul, so that although you
have become a servant to body, you may again rise to the Order from
which you descended, joining works to sacred reason!"

To this end we are commended to learn the Intelligible which exists
beyond the mind, that divine portion of the being which exists beyond
Intellect: and this it is only possible to grasp with the flower of the
mind. "Understand the intelligible with the extended flame of an
extended intellect." To Zoroaster also was attributed the utterance "who
knows himself knows all things in himself;" while it is elsewhere
suggested that "The paternal Mind has sowed symbols in the Soul." But
such priceless knowledge was possible only to the Theurgists Who, we are
told, "fall not so as to be ranked with the herd that are in subjection
to fate." The divine light cannot radiate in an imperfect microcosm,
even as the Clouds obscure the Sun; for of such as make ascent to the
most divine of speculations in a confused and disordered manner, with
unhallowed lips, or unwashed feet, the progressions are imperfect, the
impulses are vain and the paths are dark.

Although destiny, our destiny, may be " written in the Stars" yet it was
the mission of the divine Soul to raise the human Soul above the circle
of necessity, and the Oracles give Victory to that Masterly Will, which

"Hews the wall with might of magic,  
Breaks the palisade in pieces,  
Hews to atoms seven pickets . . .  
Speaks the Master words of knowledge! "

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

The means taken to that consummation consisted in the training of the
Will and the elevation, of the imagination, a divine power which
controls consciousness: Believe yourself to be above body, and you are,"
says the Oracle; it might have added "Then shall regenerate phantasy
disclose the symbols of the Soul."

But it is said "On beholding yourself fear!" *i.e.*, . the imperfect
self.

Everything must be viewed as ideal by him who would understand the
ultimate perfection.

Will is the grand agent in the mystic progress; its rule is all potent
over the nervous system. By Will the fleeting vision is fixed on the
treacherous waves of the astral Light; by Will the consciousness is
impelled to commune with the divinity: yet there is not One Will, but
three Wills--the Wills, namely, of the Divine, the Rational and
Irrational Souls--to harmonize these is the difficulty.

It is selfishness which impedes the radiation of Thought, and attaches
to body. This is scientifically true and irrespective of sentiment, the
selfishness which reaches beyond the necessities of body is pure
vulgarity.

A picture which to the cultured eye beautifully portrays a given
subject, nevertheless appears to the savage a confused patchwork of
streaks, so the extended perceptions of a citizen of the Universe are
not grasped by those whose thoughts dwell within the sphere of the
personal life.

The road to the *Summum Bonum* lies therefore through self-sacrifice,
the sacrifice of the lower to the higher, for behind that Higher Self
lies the concealed form of the Antient of Days, the synthetical Being of
Divine Humanity.

These things are grasped by Soul; the song of the Soul is alone heard in
the adytum of God-nourished Silence!
