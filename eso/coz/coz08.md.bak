# ORACLES FROM PORPHYRY.

1\. There is above the Celestial Lights an Incorruptible Flame always
sparkling; the Spring of Life, the Formation of all Beings, the Original
of all things! This Flame produceth all things, and

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

nothing perisheth but what it consumeth. It maketh Itself known by
Itself. This Fire cannot be contained in any Place, it is without Body
and without Matter. It encompasseth the Heavens. And there goeth out
from it little Sparks, which make all the Fires of the Sun, of the Moon,
and of the Stars. Behold! what I know of God! Strive not to know more of
Him, for that is beyond thy capacity, how wise soever thou art. As to
the rest, know that unjust and wicked Man cannot hide himself from the
Presence of God!

No subtilty nor excuse can disguise anything front His piercing Eyes.
All is full of God, and God is in All!

2\. There is in God an Immense Profundity of Flame! Nevertheless, the
Heart should not fear to approach this Adorable Fire, or to be touched
by it; it will never be consumed by this sweet Fire, whose mild and
Tranquil Heat maketh the Binding, the Harmony, and the Duration of the
World. Nothing subsisteth but by this Fire, which is God Himself. No
Person begat Him; He is without Mother; He knoweth all things, and can
be taught nothing.

He is Infallible in His designs, and His name is unspeakable, Behold
now, what God is! As for us who are His messengers, *We are but a Little
Part of God*.
