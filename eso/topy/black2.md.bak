ONE

  
As we have said, Sigils have a functional purpose: they serve as a
direct means to make what you want to happen more likely to happen.
Butter they are quite different from systems based on faith and false
promises. They cannot guarantee anything; they can only help release
thee potential that already exists within. And as it is a system for
thee Individual there is no right or wrong way - what is right for one
person may be entirely inappropriate for another. Therefore thee method
is one that must be developed personally, so that thee Sigil as
performed by you is something wholly ov your own making, reflecting your
own personalities and experiences. We offer only guidance and
encouragement, not instructions and rules to obey. We leave those to
thee Controllers, thee ones who seek to generate uniformity ov thought,
and who strive to create a passive and compliant populace thinking along
rigid and con-ditioned lines, unable to take responsibility for their
own lives and actions.  
  
We are sickened by thee negative attitudes ov right and wrong that are
promulgated in thee mass media: that if you do this you cannot do that;
if you think this you cannot think that. It is a system that destroys
thee Individual; destroys thee ability to think, to question, to force
thee hand ov chance; destroys thee will to live according to who you
really are and not according to who they say you are. Sigils break down
this con-ditioning, awaken thee possibility ov change and experiment,
give back thee joy ov a life rich in experience and challenge.  
  
Sigils are as much about learning as anything else. Not only learning
thee method that works for you, butter also learning who it is you
really are, what it is you really want. A result ov this is that it may
take some time before you discover thee method ov working that is best
for you, and you may find that thee results ov your Sigils are not as
expected. This is not thee result ov getting it wrong, it is thee
natural response caused by thee first steps on a road ov discovery. For
example, things may not happen in thee order you had expected, or they
may take a different form. Thee identity ov thee people involved may be
unexpected. Butter if you examine thee results ov your work closely and
honestly you will find that these differences - these moves away from
thee pre-conceived - reflect thee true aim hidden within thee Sigil,
thee underlying qualities ov it. Thee reason for this is that your
conscious image is not thee real object ov your desire; thee conscious
wish, after all, being subject to thee con-ditioned responses thee Sigil
is designed to break down. Thee results are often more expansive than
you could have dreamed, more radical than you would have consciously
dared hope. Put simply, what you expect is not always what you really
want. And what you think you want is not always what you really want.  
  
Our concern is with thee Individual in thee modern world. Accordingly
our methods are designed to meet thee circumstances that prevail today.
They are not Occult in thee way that word is usually understood, only
thee intuitive use ov that which we already know directed with purpose.
It is a maximisation ov thee powers ov thee brain, a joining together ov
conscious and unconscious will so that through thee use ov Sigils thee
Individual can move towards a desired goal free from thee constraint ov
confused ideals and personal contradictions. Unlike much that is called
Occult we do not rely on dogma, mystification, references to orthodoxy,
or thee mimicking ov previously effective butter now redundant rituals
rules and experiences. We believe that thee strength needed is already
living in each ov us. It is simply that we need to tune in to thee right
channels, see clearly, and act on that vision. And that vision must be
fiercely personal, not thee dictate ov some other who tries to impose
their will on thee Individual, or some corporate view that leaves
nothing to chance and tells us that dissent from thee common ground is a
sin.  
  
A great deal ov energy is wasted on arguing over thee validity ov much
that falls under thee general heading ov "Occult" - whether things are
real or imagined. Much ov thee evidence to date is confusing, partial or
fabricated to meet a given need. This is thee result research being
misdirected, and thee will to understand being compromised. It is better
by far to accept "occult" experiences as they occur, to recognise and
interpret them personally without trying to fit them into a pre-defined
system. Thee Sigil strengthens basic human skills, re-awakens thee
intuitive understanding ov thee relationships between events, breaks
down linear modes ov thought that offer only tunnel vision and answers
that are defined in thee question itself. Thee Temple believes that thee
best judge ov truth is experience, combined with an attitude that
engenders a discriminating eye hampered neither by prejudice nor fear.
Thee Sigil is thee internal working ov thee brain, externalised; thee
manifestation ov inclusive will directed outward to positive action.
