TWO

  
  
In Thee Grey Book we discuss thee Sigil ov three liquids which
encoumpassesthee essence ov thee practical methods we employ; butter it
should be rememberedthat everything we say is only a guide to further
experimentation and nota dictate to be followed blindly in faith. Thee
Temple is not about instruction,thee giving ov set patterns and modes ov
behaviour to follow, for that wayno-one learns anything, there is no
progress, no interchange of ideas andl-ov-e. To slavishly follow ideas
set out on a plate is to abdicate responsibility,to lose one's
individuality in favour ov an easy, butter doubtlessly wrong,answer.  
  
This may seem hard to those who feel uneasy about how to proceed, who
areused to doing just what they are told and no more, butter that is
thee point.Thee Temple is about getting rid ov those attitudes which
ultimately leadto indifference, getting rid ov thee fear ov experiment
and genuine exploration;instead our methods create in thee Individual a
precise knowledge ov theirown existence, desires, and capabilities in
thee most creative and positivelight possible. And they force thee
acceptance ov an attitude ov livingthat will reflect that knowledge in a
directly practical way. It is onlyby embracing their individuality that
thee Individual can truly coum tothee understanding and fulfilment ov
their goals. Anything else is pointless,a waste ov energy, a
misdirection ov purpose.  
  
So what we are saying is that while thee basic format is one that can
beused by anyone, it is also one that requires absolutely thee direct
andpersonal input of thee Individual to be wholly and perfectly
effective.Specific details can and should be arrived at by you. And they
can includeor exclude anything that we have said: intent is all; and an
ability tofocus on thee goal.  
  
Nonetheless, we recognise that guidance can be useful. And neither do
weforget that Sigils, in one form or another, have been practised
throughouthistory. In order to illustrate what we mean, and to encourage
your ownexperimentation, we include here examples from both historical
and presentday sources.  

**Thee following is quoted from a book by Austin Osman
Spare(1886-1956):**

Sigils are used to enable two things to occur. l) Effective
communionwith subconscious levels. 2) The lodging of a desire or wish at
subconsciouslevels without the conscious mind being involved or aware.  
  
My formula and Sigils for sub-conscious activity are a means of
inspiration,capacity or genius, and a means of accelerating evolution.
An economy ofenergy and a method of learning by enjoyment.  
  
For the construction of Sigils the ordinary alphabet is used. The
desirefor super-human strength could be formulated as follows: "I
desirethe strength of my tigers." In order to Sigilise this desire, put
downon a piece of paper all the letters of which the sentence is
composed, omittingall repetitions. The resulting sequence of letters,
IDESRTHNGOFMY, is thencombined and incorporated into your Sigil. ( This
sequence of letters iscalled a glyph.) The wish, thus Sigilised, must
then be forgotten; thatis to say, the conscious mind must desist from
thinking about it at anytime other than the magickal time, for the
belief becomes true and vitalby striving against it in the consciousness
and by giving it (the Sigil)form. Not by the striving of faith.  
  
By virtue of the Sigil you are able to send your desire into the
subconscious(the place where all dreams meet.) All desire, whether for
pleasure or knowledgethat cannot find natural expression, can by Sigils
and their formulae findfulfilment via the subconscious.

EXPERIENCE IS BY CONTACT  
THE GREAT EXPERIENCE: SEDUCE THYSELF TO PLEASURE

**I AM THE POWER OF MY DESIRE**

  The energising of such a Sigil must occur at a special time. At
themoment of orgasm the wish must be imperatively formulated. It is not
inthe actual Sigil that the power resides (this is merely the vehicle of
thedesire) but in the intent with which it is despatched at the moment
of exhaustion.Any glyph, personal or traditional, may be used as a
Sigil. If personal,it must be the specific vehicle of the desire and
designed for no otherpurpose; if traditional, it must have received a
new direction which therebyconsecrates it to its secret purpose. Powers
of visualisation, and self-disciplineand concentration are qualities
necessary.
