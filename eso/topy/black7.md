SIX

  
Because Sigils exploit thee power ov sexual release and ov dream states
and thee unconscious, we believe it essential that all Individuals make
an effort to increase their awareness in these areas. One way to do this
is to keep a private diary in which to record, in as much detail as
possible, all dreams and sexual activity. Thee focus ov attention
brought about by doing this will inevitably increase one's sensitivity
and Psychick strength, which in turn will strengthen one's Sigils. We
also recommend that you keep for yourself a record ov all Sigils, and ov
anything you feel happened as a result, or is in some way connected.
Again, include as much detail as you can, such as your objective, your
feelings and observations, thee quality ov orgasm, fantasies employed
etc., and anything else that seems relevant to thee work (no matter how
seemingly co-incidental) that caught your attention.
