### Chapter IX

### PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECT OF THE COMPLETE

### BREATH

Scarcely too much can be said of the advantages attending the practice
of the Complete Breath. And yet the student who has carefully read the
foregoing pages should scarcely need to have pointed out to him such
advantages.

The practice of the Complete Breath will make any man or woman immune to
Consumption and other pulmonary troubles, and will do away with all
liability to contract "colds," as well as bronchial and similar
weaknesses. Consumption is due principally to lowered vitality
attributable to an insufficient amount of air being inhaled. The
impairment of vitality renders the system open to attacks from disease
germs. Imperfect breathing allows a considerable part of the lungs to
remain inactive, and such portions offer an inviting field for bacilli,
which invading the weakened tissue soon produce havoc. Good healthy lung
tissue will resist the germs, and the only way to have good healthy lung
tissue is to use the lungs properly.

Consumptives are nearly all narrow-chested. What does this mean? Simply
that these people were addicted to improper habits of breathing, and
consequently their chests failed to develop and expand. The man who
practices the Complete Breath will have a full broad chest and the
narrow-chested man may develop his chest to normal proportions if he
will but adopt this mode of breathing. Such people must develop their
chest cavities if they value their

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

lives. Colds may often be prevented by practicing a little vigorous
Complete Breathing whenever you feel that you are being unduly exposed.
When chilled, breathe vigorously a few minutes, and you will feel a glow
all over your body. Most colds can be cured by Complete Breathing and
partial fasting for a day.

The quality of the blood depends largely upon its proper oxygenation in
the lungs, and if it is under-oxygenated it becomes poor in quality and
laden with all sorts of impurities, and the system suffers from lack of
nourishment, and often becomes actually poisoned by the waste products
remaining uneliminated in the blood. As the entire body, every organ and
every part, is dependent upon the blood for nourishment, impure blood
must have a serious effect upon the entire system. The remedy is
plain—practice the Yogi Complete Breath.

The stomach and other organs of nutrition suffer much from improper
breathing. Not only are they ill nourished by reason of the lack of
oxygen, but as the food must absorb oxygen from the blood and become
oxygenated before it can be digested and assimilated, it is readily seen
how digestion and assimilation is impaired by incorrect breathing. And
when assimilation is not normal, the system receives less and less
nourishment, the appetite fails, bodily vigor decreases, and energy
diminishes, and the man withers and declines. All from the lack of
proper breathing.

Even the nervous system suffers from improper breathing, inasmuch as the
brain, the spinal cord, the nerve centers, and the nerves themselves,
when improperly nourished by means of [the](errata.htm#16.md) blood, become
poor and inefficient instruments for generating, storing.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

and transmitting the nerve currents. And improperly nourished they will
become if sufficient oxygen is not absorbed through the lungs. There is
another aspect of the case whereby the nerve currents themselves, or
rather the force from which the nerve currents spring, becomes lessened
from want of proper breathing, but this belongs to another phase of the
subject which is treated of in other chapters of this book, and our
purpose here is to direct your attention to the fact that the mechanism
of the nervous system is rendered inefficient as an instrument for
conveying nerve force, as the indirect result of a lack of proper
breathing.

The effect of the reproductive organs upon the general health is too
well known to be discussed at length here, but we may be permitted to
say that with the reproductive organs in a weakened condition the entire
system feels the reflex action and suffers sympathetically. The Complete
Breath produces a rhythm which is Nature's own plan for keeping this
important part of the system in normal condition, and, from the first,
it will be noticed that the reproductive functions are strengthened and
vitalized, thus, by sympathetic reflex action, giving tone to the whole
system. By this, we do not mean that the lower sex impulses will be
aroused; far from it. The Yogis are advocates of continence and
chastity, and have learned to control the animal passions. But sexual
control does not mean sexual weakness, and the Yogi teachings are that
the man or woman whose reproductive organism is normal and healthy, will
have a stronger will with which to control himself or herself. The Yogi
believes that much of the perversion of this wonderful part of the
system comes from a

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

lack of normal health, and results from a morbid rather than a normal
condition of these organs. A little careful consideration of this
question will prove that the Yogi teachings are right. This is not the
place to discuss the subject fully, but the Yogis know that sex-energy
may be conserved and used for the development of the body and mind of
the individual, instead of being dissipated in unnatural excesses as is
the wont of so many uninformed people. By special request we will give
in this book one of the favorite Yogi exercises for this purpose. But
whether or not the student wishes to adopt the Yogi theories of
continence and clean-living, he or she will find that the Complete
Breath will do more to restore health to this part of the system than
anything else ever tried. Remember, now, we mean normal health, not
undue development. The sensualist will find that normal means a
lessening of desire rather than an increase; the weakened man or woman
will find a toning up and a relief from the weakness which has
heretofore depressed him or her. We do not wish to be misunderstood or
misquoted on this subject. The Yogis' ideal is a body strong in all its
parts, under the control of a masterful and developed Will, animated by
high ideals.

In the practice of the Complete Breath, during inhalation, the diaphragm
contracts and exerts a gentle pressure upon the liver, stomach and other
organs, which in connection with the rhythm of the lungs acts as a
gentle massage of these organs and stimulates their actions, and
encourages normal functioning. Each inhalation aids in this internal
exercise, and assists in causing a normal circulation to the organs of
nutrition and [elimination](errata.htm#17.md). In High or Mid Breathing

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the organs lose the benefit accruing from this internal massage.

The Western world is paying much attention to Physical Culture just now,
which is a good thing. But in their enthusiasm they must not forget that
the exercise of the external muscles is not everything. The internal
organs also need exercise, and Nature's plan for this exercise is proper
breathing. The diaphragm is Nature's principal instrument for this
internal exercise. Its motion vibrates the important organs of nutrition
and elimination, and massages and kneads them at each inhalation and
exhalation, forcing blood into them, and then squeezing it out, and
imparting a general tone to the organs. Any organ or part of the body
which is not exercised gradually atrophies and refuses to function
properly, and lack of the internal exercise afforded by the
diaphragmatic action leads to diseased organs. The Complete Breath gives
the proper motion to the diaphragm, as well as exercising the middle and
upper chest. It is indeed "complete" in its action.

From the standpoint of Western physiology alone, without reference to
the Oriental philosophies and science, this Yogi system of Complete
Breathing is of vital importance to every man, woman and child who
wishes to acquire health and keep it. Its very simplicity keeps
thousands from seriously considering it, while they spend fortunes in
seeking health through complicated and expensive "systems." Health
knocks at their door and they answer not. Verily the stone which the
builders reject is the real cornerstone of the Temple of Health.
