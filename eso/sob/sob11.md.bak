### Chapter X

### A FEW BITS OF YOGI LORE

We give below three forms of breath, quite popular among the Yogis. The
first is the well-known Yogi Cleansing Breath, to which is attributed
much of the great lung endurance found among the Yogis. They usually
finish up a breathing exercise with this Cleansing Breath, and we have
followed this plan in this book. We also give the Yogi Nerve Vitalizing
Exercise, which has been handed down among them for ages, and which has
never been improved on by Western teachers of Physical Culture, although
some of them have "borrowed" it from teachers of Yoga. We also give the
Yogi Vocal Breath, which accounts largely for the melodious, vibrant
voices of the better class of the Oriental Yogis. We feel that if this
book contained nothing more than these three exercises, it would be
invaluable to the Western student. Take these exercises as a gift from
your Eastern brothers and put them into practice.

THE YOGI CLEANSING BREATH

The Yogis have a favorite form of breathing which they practice when
they feel the necessity of ventilating and cleansing the lungs. They
conclude many of their other breathing exercises with this breath, and
we have followed this practice in this book. This Cleansing Breath
ventilates and cleanses the lungs, stimulates the cells and gives a
general tone to the respiratory organs, and is conducive to their
general healthy condition. Besides this effect, it is found to greatly
refresh the entire system. Speakers, singers,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

etc., will find this breath especially restful, after having tired the
respiratory organs.

\(1\) Inhale a complete breath.

\(2\) Retain the air a few seconds.

\(3\) Pucker up the lips as if for a whistle (but do not swell out the
cheeks), then exhale a little air through the opening, with considerable
vigor. Then stop for a moment, retaining the air, and then exhale a
little more air. Repeat until the air is completely exhaled. Remember
that considerable vigor is to be used in exhaling the air through the
opening in the lips.

This breath will be found quite refreshing when one is tired and
generally "used up." A trial will convince the student of its merits.
This exercise should be practiced until it can be performed naturally
and easily, as it is used to finish up a number of other exercises given
in this book, and it should be thoroughly understood.

THE YOGI NERVE VITALIZING BREATH

This is an exercise well known to the Yogis, who. consider it one of the
strongest nerve stimulants and invigorants

known to man. Its purpose is to stimulate the Nervous System, develop
nerve force, energy and vitality. This exercise brings a stimulating
pressure to bear on important nerve centers, which in turn stimulate and
energize the entire nervous system, and send an increased flow of nerve
force to all parts of the body.

\(1\) Stand erect.

\(2\) Inhale a Complete Breath, and retain same.

\(3\) Extend the arms straight in front of you, letting them be somewhat
limp and relaxed, with only sufficient nerve force to hold them out.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

\(4\) Slowly draw the hands back toward the shoulders, gradually
contracting the muscles and putting force into them, so that when they
reach the shoulders the fists will be so tightly clenched that a
tremulous motion is felt.

\(5\) Then, keeping the muscles tense, push the fists slowly out, and
then draw them back rapidly (still tense) several times.

\(6\) Exhale vigorously through the mouth.

\(7\) Practice the Cleansing Breath.

The efficiency of this exercise depends greatly upon the speed of the
drawing back of the fists, and the tension of the muscles, and, of
course, upon the full lungs. This exercise must be tried to be
appreciated. It is without equal as a "bracer," as our Western friends
put it.

THE YOGI VOCAL BREATH

The Yogis have a form of breathing to develop the voice. They are noted
for their wonderful voices, which are strong, smooth and clear, and have
a wonderful trumpet-like carrying power. They have practiced this
particular form of breathing exercise which has resulted in rendering
their voices soft, beautiful and flexible, imparting to it that
indescribable, peculiar floating quality, combined with great power. The
exercise given below will in time impart the above-mentioned qualities,
or the Yogi Voice, to the student who practices it faithfully. It is to
be understood, of course, that this form of breath is to be used only as
an occasional exercise, and not as a regular form of breathing.

\(1\) Inhale a Complete Breath very slowly, but steadily, through the
nostrils, taking as much time as possible in the inhalation.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

\(2\) Retain for a few seconds.

\(3\) Expel the air vigorously in one great breath, through the wide
opened mouth.

\(4\) Rest the lungs by the Cleansing Breath.

Without going deeply into the Yogi theories of sound-production in
speaking and singing, we wish to say that experience has taught them
that the timbre, quality and power of a voice depends not alone upon the
vocal organs in the throat, but that the facial muscles, etc., have much
to do with the matter. Some men with large chests produce but a poor
tone, while others with comparatively small chests produce tones of
amazing strength and quality. Here is an interesting experiment worth
trying: Stand before a glass and pucker up your mouth and whistle, and
note the shape of your mouth and the general expression of your face.
Then sing or speak as you do naturally, and see the difference. Then
start to whistle again for a few seconds, and then, without changing the
position of your lips or face, sing a few notes and notice what a
vibrant resonant, clear and beautiful tone is produced.
