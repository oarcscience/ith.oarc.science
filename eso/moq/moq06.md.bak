### The Brotherhood of the White Lodge.

In the days of old, when physical force was the chief arbiter between
man and man, those that loved knowledge were compelled to abandon the
affairs of this world and to retire to the forests and hills in order to
pursue their studies. They could never maintain their position among
fighting and cruel tyrants, and were obliged to live solitary lives,
contenting themselves with a few morsels of bread to satisfy their
hunger and plain water to quench their thirst. They slept on the bare
earth and from early morning till late at night they meditated and
studied and prayed. These were the Gnanis and Bhaktas of the past.
Nowadays there are schools and colleges and societies and institutions
where the ancient wisdom can be studied quite comfortably in easy
chairs, with the use of electric light and central heating systems to
keep us oblivious to the hardships of the outside world.

In themselves these blessings of modern

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

civilization are quite harmless, but in an indirect manner they do
injure us. The pure consciousness of man is not enriched by study *per
se*, and the increase of knowledge is not the highest aim of man, it is
only if knowledge is made subservient to love that it fulfills its
mission. Therefore when the acquisition of learning is made possible in
the midst of comforts, and even luxury, the danger always exists of
hardening the mind and making it miss the beautiful lessons of charity,
forgiveness and forbearance, while those who are trained by hardships
and have to learn their lessons on empty or half-filled stomachs are
more accessible to the appeals of suffering and want. Consequently the
deprivations which the poor students had to undergo in olden times
taught them as much (if not more) as their books, whereas the well-off
students of today are ever in peril of losing their souls while
enlarging their minds.

\*         \*         \*         \*

The Brotherhood of the White Lodge is a body of great men whose souls
have been made perfect through suffering, they watch over humanity from
their exalted planes on

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

which their spiritual status enables them to live and pour down upon it
knowledge and wisdom, and skill in the arts and crafts according as the
world's Karma permits them to do so.

They are always affiliated to those organizations on earth whose members
are single-minded, and true hearted and genuinely desirous of the
welfare of the race. Especially are they interested in the advancement
of science, philosophy and religion, and all public bodies promoting
these subjects are helped (without knowing whence the help cometh) by
the Brotherhood of the White Lodge. For the last three decades there has
been a steady and growing increase of knowledge in all departments of
human activity. Inventions have multiplied, and discoveries of
unsuspected laws of nature are being made on every hand. Philosophic and
scientific thought has never been so abundant and so brilliant as it is
today, but the receivers of the gifts know not the givers, and often
frustrate the gracious purposes which were to be served by the bestowal
of the gifts.

\*         \*         \*         \*

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

The reason is not far to seek, it is to be found in the heart of man
where is the spring of all actions. To serve faithfully the Masters of
Wisdom, the givers of all good gifts, the heart must be pure and the
whole nature must have been regenerated, but this is a process of slow
growth and requires the subdual of the personality and the crushing of
the lower nature. It is only those in whom personality has been
suppressed who can be made perfect channels for the eternal truths; as
long as the snake is alive, man can only be an inferior instrument of
nature. When the old Adam dies and the snake has given up its ghost then
can man become a servant of the great Lords and co-operate with them
here on earth. Therefore it often happens that those that are to be
honored by the King of Kings and Lord of Lords must first be slaves and
servants and learn to obey before they are allowed to command. Thus in
modern times disciples are thrown into all sorts of trials and sorrows.

Poverty, disease, and friendlessness, they must know them all, until the
last vestige of pride and aloofness has disappeared from

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

their mental make up. . . . So it comes to it that like the poverty
stricken Gnanis and the Bhaktas of old, the refined students of today
have likewise to undergo the same training if they are to be fitted as
Messengers of the White Lodge. They must taste the bitterness of the cup
unto the very dregs, and through their own sufferings learn to
sympathize with those of others.

This is the straight and narrow way which leadeth unto life eternal.

This is the working of the white law, the operations of which are often
so puzzling to the eyes of flesh.

It is only our own blindness and the narrowness of our own life that
makes us find fault with the law, which is both wise and good.

What we see in the outer life of an individual is but an infinitesimal
particle of what is going on within him. The interior life of the soul
is the reality that matters, and it is here that the work of redemption
of every soul is going on.

Whenever the outer life is clouded, the inner is touched, and this
method is resorted to by the Brotherhood of the White Lodge

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

to train their disciples on the earth plane.

The ancient sages came from the poorest families, and the prophets of
the future will have to be saved from the gutter before they can deliver
their message.

It behooves, therefore, those who are anxious to do the Master's will to
be mindful of these facts. The White Lodge has its representatives on
earth, its messengers and teachers, and pupils; what we see of all these
is only as much as we deserve to see. Let us beware of putting a
stumbling block in the path of even the least of these, lest in so doing
we be found among those who work against the good law and against the
will of its blessed custodians—The Brotherhood of the White Lodge.
