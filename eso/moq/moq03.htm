<P><A NAME="fn_0"></A><A HREF="moq03.htm#fr_0">5:*</A> This interpretation of the hieroglyphic meaning of the Hebrew letters is taken from a very rare and valuable manuscript in possession of Mr. Gewurz. He has in preparation a larger work, on "The Restoration of the Hebrew Language," into which this manuscript will be embodied. Those who are interested in ancient languages, and the lovers of the Hebrew tongue especially, will find this larger work a great help in their studies. Mr. Gewurz has already devoted to it over ten years of untiring labour, but it may take another year till it is complete.</P>
