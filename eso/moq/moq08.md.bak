### CHAPTER I.

#### THE QABALAH.

Before entering into a study of the holy scriptures which shall be more
profitable than that which has been entered into by the sectarian
dogmatists of the past, it is necessary to obtain a sure foundation upon
which may be built a stately edifice worthy the attention of men who
value truth and wisdom more than mere argument.

To this end a knowledge of the methods used by the Qabalists of old to
explain their sacred scriptures and mysteries is necessary, for it is
this knowledge which will constitute the foundation of the edifice. It
is essential that these methods be fully understood, for any new
presentment of ancient truths must carry conviction with it, must, as it
were, prove itself as it goes, and prove itself logically so that the
student may pass step by step and stage by stage to a complete
understanding of the mysteries.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

The Qabalah, playing as it does such an important part in the unveiling
of the Scriptures, must be understood by those who wish to enter into
the details and comprehend fully the methods used by the Qabalists.
Hence the first and most important question to be answered is "What is
the Qabalah?"

It is easy to give an explanation of the meaning of the word itself, for
its root is QBL, which means "to receive," hence the Qabalah is the
"received" doctrine, the esoteric side of the scriptures, the Doctrine
of the Heart, in contradistinction to the doctrine of the eye, the inner
Truth as opposed to the outer form.

There is, however, no Book of the Qabalah, no manuscript called "The
Qabalah," but many manuscripts and books have been written based upon
qabalistic knowledge, and these different works are known collectively
as the Qabalah. They are, however, merely opinions and statements
embodying the ideas of the Hidden Wisdom, which has ever been taught to
companies of students by the teachers of the Secret Doctrine though
seldom written down. The

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

true innermost teachings are always given "in the house" or upon the
hill, that is to say, "in Open Lodge."

We have, however, to remember, when entering upon a study of the
Qabalah, that it is to be viewed in three ways, *viz*., historically, as
regards the documents, etc., then again in reference to the qabalistic
methods of teaching and unveiling the mysteries hidden in the
scriptures, and finally, as the Qabalah, the Wisdom itself, or Spirit,
Soul and Body, for everything in the whole universe must of necessity be
threefold as will be proved later, and therefore the Qabalah is no
exception to the rule.

It is well to remember these distinctions and to realize the difference
between the Qabalistic Wisdom, the means of production and the product
or appearance. The Qabalah, then, viewed from this point of view, is not
a book as so often thought, just as the Occult Teaching, the *Secret
Doctrine* is not a book, even though the Secret Doctrine happens to be
the name of a book containing many of the teachings derived from that
source.

What, then, is the Qabalah, and whence

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

does it originate? These are the questions which have puzzled the minds
of many scholars in the past and may still continue to puzzle many in
the future, especially those who endeavor to fix and tabulate the
Ancient Wisdom, who do not look beyond the eye of flesh.

Hitherto nothing definite has been settled as to the origin of the
Qabalah; as regards the documentary evidence there are few historical
data of an exact kind upon which the intellectual writers could fall
back, hence many have been driven into the realm of surmise and opinion.
One declares, repeating the information given in a very old manuscript,
that this wisdom was given by God himself to a company of angels, and
esoterically speaking he may be correct, if we think of an Avatar in the
place of a personal God and of Masters instead of Angels. Another
declares the Qabalah or rather that part of it comprised under the title
Zohar to be the work of Simeon ben Yochai, who lived at the time of the
destruction of the second Temple, whilst others declare that it is a
modern invention, the work of Moses de Leon. All seem to forget

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

that the Qabalah itself, being merely the expression of Cosmic Truth,
can have had no actual beginning but must be as eternal as that truth
itself. It is reasonable to *suppose* (although there are many
Occultists who have a knowledge of the past and *declare* that there
were always some Great Ones upon earth with a knowledge of the Secret
Wisdom or Qabalah) that there were indeed always men who knew of these
doctrines and that they were continually being given out to the world in
different lands and at different epochs as required, sometimes in one
form and at other times in another, but ever was the same Truth veiled
in the teachings. The Qabalah or the vehicle for the Divine Wisdom is
eternal, for it is the means of manifesting the knowledge stored up in
the memory of Nature, the memory of God, the Akashic Records or Aether
of Space.

This Aether of Space is according to Occultists a veritable Picture
Gallery, or rather a Kinemetograph which when wound up and contacted by
the initiated Seer shows picture after picture of the Past, as veil
after veil is lifted, for these pictures are the

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

true memory of Nature impressed upon the Aether or *Akasha*, just as the
memory of the past is said by scientists to be impressed upon the matter
of the brain. If the one statement be found reasonable then the other is
not a whit less so.

In this sense, then, the Qabalah had no beginning except as the world
itself had a beginning, and man himself had a beginning, for the Divine
Wisdom is Eternal in the Heavens.

"But there must have been a time when the wisdom was first promulgated,
when these Qabalistic doctrines were first given out to students," says
the reader. True, but then we have to consider that our knowledge of
history does not take us far back into the tune-stream. Wherever we
look, apart from the ordinary historical records, we find that this
inner teaching has existed. We see it hidden in the ancient writings of
South America, in the Temples and on the stones and monuments of Egypt,
and elsewhere. The same wisdom is to be read in the Sacred Writings the
world over, in Sanskrit, in Greek, in Latin, in Chinese, and in fact in
any sacred writing which is

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

truly sacred, that is, which is capable of teaching Truth to man. In the
Vedas it looms large, it is to be found upon the [papyri](errata.htm#3.md)
of the Priests of Egypt, on the stones of Assyria and Babylon, in the
writings of the ancient Persians and Sassanians, in all countries and in
all climes. In Peru and in other parts of America, in China, in Japan
and throughout Asia, Africa, Europe and Australia, everywhere are traces
of this Ancient Wisdom to be found. The Occultists tell us likewise in
various works, notably the *Secret Doctrine*, *Isis Unveiled*, *Man;
Whence, How and Whither*, and many others, that the Ancient Wisdom was
ever known to the Teachers of men and continually given out by them as
time and occasion called it forth. All this may be seen in the pictures
of the Kinemetograph of Nature, the Akashic records. It is, however,
useless to offer evidence of this description where the historical facts
are required and for this latter purpose a history of the written
Qabalah will be necessary.

There exist certain manuscripts of a certain date and from these we
deduce certain facts: this is the method usually followed

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

by the historians. In the case of the "history" of the Qabalah, it is
but a will-o’-the-wisp, which leads us nowhere, although it is necessary
in order to have a general idea of the subject to chase this
will-o’-the-wisp until it can lead us no farther, and then we shall have
to depend upon the voice of Intuition. And here it may be necessary to
say that in addition to the Bibliography at the end of this volume,
there are other sources and other authorities upon which these writings
are based, and these authorities have been consulted during the course
of the studies. The careful student always likes to have before him
chapter and verse of the "authority." "Where," he asks, "did you obtain
this knowledge?" "What is the authority for the statements?" and so
forth. The answer is easy. A certain knowledge of the efforts made by
others in the past to unravel the Qabalistic mysteries is necessary to
all students, but need not long be dwelt upon, for the only thing that
matters is the knowledge of the Qabalah itself and not what men think of
it. This book knowledge then constitutes a part of the "authority," for
all that will be given

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

out in these pages, but the chief <span
class="smallcaps">Authority</span> is the knowledge applied and the
"sweet reasonableness" inherent in the teaching itself. With the
different Keys, of which a description will shortly be given, it is
possible for all students to apply the knowledge of the Qabalah to the
unraveling of the scriptures and their mysteries. Apart, then, from the
books to which reference is made at the end of this number, there are
other "books" used in the compiling of these writings, and it may be
well to name them. The first "book" is called "The Volume of the Aural
Knowledge," the second is "The Book of the Intuition," the third is "The
Voice of the Earthly Guru," and finally, there is the "book" to which
all students may refer, "The Book of the Akashic Records."
Unfortunately, however, these are all "out of print," and cannot be read
even at the British Museum. The reader, therefore, who cannot read these
works, will have to be content with the use of his Balance, he will be
able to weigh in that all that is here set forth and judge all that is
written in the calm light of Reason. Faith and knowledge must go hand in

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

hand in studies such as these, although every effort will be made to
satisfy the critical mind.

So many minds, so many ideas. One historian, copying from another, tells
us that the Qabalah was given. by God to a company of Angels, another
says that it was handed from Abraham to his son and so on unto the
present. This latter, we may feel sure, is correct, though chapter and
verse cannot be quoted to prove such a statement. A. E. Waite speaks of
the book called *Sepher Yetzirah*, in which certain Qabalistic doctrines
are written as probably being the work of Rabbi Akiba, and as supposed
to have been written down during the second century. We cannot accept
the idea that Rabbi Akiba was the actual author of this work, but
certainly as a Qabalist, which assuredly he was according to his
esoteric writings, he certainly may have been one of those who were led
to write down some of the knowledge which had come to him, as was done
in the time of the great Rabbi Simeon ben Yechai by his disciples. It is
certain that the Qabalistic doctrines were commonly known to students

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

as far back as the first century, and also that there were manuscripts
which could be read by Christians who had access to them, for the
doctrine relating to the inner meanings of the Hebrew Alphabet, which is
the most important Qabalistic teaching, the true Key to the scriptures,
is mentioned by St. Agobard, in the following words:

"Further, they believe the letters of their alphabet to have existed
from everlasting, and before the beginning of the world to have received
diverse offices, in virtue of which they should preside over created
things."

This quotation is from a letter of St. Agobard, and in mentioning it in
his *Doctrine and Literature of the Kabalah*, Waite does not seem to
have noticed in passing by this evidence of the antiquity of the written
Qabalah, the fact that St. Agobard is himself quoting from the Book of
the Zohar, or Splendour, in which it is stated that all the Hebrew
letters were used by God to prepare for the creation of the world. To
this fact we refer later on, when the letters themselves will be
explained and their true significance be shown. It is sufficient to

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

know from this quotation alone that the Qabalistic works date back
considerably before the first century, for here we have a writer quoting
from them as from old-established doctrines well known to all. The date
can be placed even farther back by those who study the doctrines of the
ancient Egyptians, and indeed it may be said in the opinion of many
students that the Qabalistic teachings are undoubtedly of Egyptian and
Chaldaic origin as far as the Jews are concerned. This might well be
proved by a comparison of the meanings and values of the Hebrew and
Egyptian letters, but that must be left until a later period.

The Book of the Zohar is said to have originated with Rabbi Simeon ben
Yochai, but this is not accepted by the different scholars, who claim
that the writer of the Sepher Ha-Zohar was merely a very much more
modern writer who lived some centuries after the Rabbi Simeon. This
writer, Moses de Leon, who died in the year 1305, is said to have sold
the book himself, calling it the work of Simeon ben Yochai. Some have
called him harsh names for this so-called mis-statement, but it is not
so false

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

as it would appear. It is beyond doubt that this same Moses de Leon was
the compiler and writer of the Book of the Zohar as such, but he,
according to the "Book of Intuition," merely wrote down the ideas which
certainly were given out by the Rabbi Simeon as a consecutive narrative
or book and issued it as the work of the Rabbi Simeon ben Yochai which,
strictly speaking, it was, although Moses de Leon was the compiler. Who
knows but what Moses de Leon himself was a reincarnation of one of the
disciples of the Rabbi Simeon and that he was overshadowed in the work
of compilation by the great and blessed Rav himself as others since have
been. But this by the way, such evidence not being fitting for the eyes
and ears of scholars.

The book of the Zohar is said by its compiler to have been discovered in
a cavern where it had lain many years, and it is not an unlikely tale,
although scoffed at by modern critics. It is quite reasonable to suppose
that Moses de Leon did find some old manuscripts written by the
disciples of the Rabbi Simeon in the second century, and that he edited
them and re-arranged

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

their teachings and added some of his own wisdom of which we may be sure
he had an abundance. But it is not correct to declare that he pretended
that these were doctrines of an ancient time whilst writing them
himself.

The mention of Saint Agobard and his writings by A. E. Waite, is truly
strange, for he, although rejecting the idea that the work called the
Zohar was a forgery of Moses de Leon, and being inclined to believe that
the doctrines treated of therein were far older than time of writing,
does not notice that Saint Agobard himself, who lived between the year
779 and 840, makes clear reference to the very same doctrines of which
Moses de Leon is accused of being the forger. The quotation of Saint
Agobard is taken from the book of the Zohar or, rather, from the
teachings included in that work, as all may see on referring thereto.
Hitherto there has been no writer or scholar who has noticed this
striking refutation of the attack upon Moses de Leon which is
remarkable, to say the least of it, for here is ample proof that the
doctrines in question are far older even than the time of

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rabbi Moses de
Leon who is in some quarters believed to have been their author. Saint
Agobard then makes references to doctrines which have been said by some
to have been invented in the 13th century, though lie himself lived in
the first century.

Dr. Schiller-Szinessy in the *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, 9th edition,
says that the Zohar "was begun in Palestine late in the second or third
century, <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>, and finished at the latest
in the sixth or seventh century. It is impossible that it should have
been composed after that time and before the renaissance, as both
language and contents show."

This does not, however, dispose of the fact that the Qabalah itself is
of infinitely greater antiquity even though some of its doctrines may
have been written down in the second century.

To search for the "author" of the Qabalah as scholars have done for so
long, is in fact a vain attempt, for it would be just as wise to search
for the origin of Religion itself. As H. P. Blavatsky says in her
*Theosophical Glossary*, no two writers are "agreed upon the origin of
the Kabala, the Zohar, Sepher Yetzirah. Some show them as coming from

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

the Biblical Patriarchs, Abraham and even Seth: others from Egypt,
others again from Chaldea. The system is certainly very old: but *like
all the rest of the systems, whether religious or philosophical, the
Kabala is derived directly from the primeval Secret Doctrine of the
East*. <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) . . . Whatever its source, its
substratum is at any rate identical with that of all the other ancient
systems, from the *Book of the Dead*, down to the later Gnostics."

Hence the student is again reminded that the study of Qabalah is no mere
Jewish work, but must be the work of occult students whose ideas are
beyond the reach of sectarian differences, although they may be working
within a sect or born into the environment of a special religion, for
the occult student is not bound by forms even whilst he follows the
ceremonies and ritual of his forefathers. Indeed it is wise that

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

he should follow them, from an occult point of view.

For those who are interested in dates and descriptions it will be
helpful to refer to the works mentioned at the end of this volume, but
it is not essential to the study of the true doctrine. Let it suffice to
quote one of the best and most intuitive men who has ever translated the
Qabalistic writings, before passing from this section of our study.

Isaac Myer, in his erudite and intuitive work called *Qabbalah*, page
170, says that the Gnostics, and others, the so-called heretical sects,
copied from the Qabalah, which is not perfectly correct, for it would be
better to say that the Gnostics were acquainted with the Secret Wisdom
which is Qabalah, but this is of no moment. He goes on to state, "we may
find many of the Hebrew Qabbalistic ideas in the Aryan writings, in the
Vedas, especially in their Upanishads, in the *Bhagavadgita*, the
*Tantras*, etc. Among the Chinese, in the Yih-King, the writings
attributed to Laou Tze’, and other secret philosophical books. We may
also find them in the Zend, and other early Persian writings, in the
cuneiform

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

texts of the early inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Chaldea, Babylonia, and
Assyria: on the monuments and papyrus of Egypt, and among the remains of
the archaic Buddhists and Dravidian races of India, among others in the
cave temples of Ellora, Elephanta, and the Sanchi and Amravati topes. It
is extremely probable that many reminiscences of them are in Thibet, in
the possession of the Buddhists."

Thus standing the ravages of time what can this wisdom be but truly
Divine and Eternal.

The history of books is not important after all, it is the
"Thing-in-itself" that matters to the truth seeker. Let us then, leave
these dates and data, for the history of the Qabalah has not yet been
nor will ever be written by any scholar, whose knowledge is of the head
only.

The various books called "Qabalistic" or purporting to be the "Qabalah"
are many. Few of them have been translated and the most important has
not yet been thoroughly translated into the English tongue, although
there is a splendid version in French of the Zohar, translated by De
Pauly and posthumously

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

issued by his friend Lafume-Giraud to both of whom the greatest
gratitude is due, for there is no better translation extant. It is not,
however, perfect, for there are many interpolations introduced for the
sake of clearness, which may have the opposite effect. However, if read,
with the eye of the Spirit an infinite amount of knowledge may be gained
by students. Most of the Zoharic quotations of this series are from that
work.

The following are the works in question: The Book of the Zohar, or
Sepher Ha-Zohar, which includes within it many treatises and books, all
called generically *Zohar*, but known separately by other names. The
book of Zohar proper is a commentary of rare worth upon the Pentateuch,
in which is concealed a vast amount of learning, though it is not easy
to follow its reasoning except with a key and also with the aid of a
knowledge of the Eastern doctrines, and the Sanskrit writings. Many
editions of this work have been issued partly in Hebrew, but mainly in
Aramaic and Chaldaic.

The next in importance is the *Sepher* 

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Yetzirah* <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md), or book of formation, which is not
mentioned by all writers, though it has been translated into French and
English. It refers mystically to the "creation by number," and requires
much thought for the unravelling of the mysteries there "explained,"
especially in the English translation. It is also noted for its
treatment of the "thirty-two paths." It is a very short treatise though
its wisdom is infinite. There is a difficulty in judging the age of the
different manuscripts, but probably this is the oldest of all. There is,
however, no definite authority for these statements, for all writers
differ, so that we shall have to be content merely with the Qabalah
itself, and leave the dates to those who care for them.

The *Sepher Sephiroth*, or book of the Becomings, treats of the
Emanation of the different Cosmic Beings, the evolution of the Many from
the <span class="smallcaps">One</span>, or rather the description of the
Many who themselves constitute the <span class="smallcaps">One</span>.
This is the book from which most of the "intellectual" writers cull
their riddles when they speak of the Ten

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sephiroth, but
seldom give any explanation of the true meaning of these "Emanations"
which is left to Theosophical writers who have given out the same
doctrines in simple language. Those students who are interested in this
subject and wish to know the details of these emanations are referred to
*The Kabbalah Unveiled*, by S. L. McGregor Mathers. The introduction to
that work is the best that has been written within the last fifty years,
and deserves the greatest attention on the part of the student, the next
in order of merit being a work written in English by Isaac Myer called
*Qabbalah* and privately published by him in 1888 at Philadelphia, there
being but 350 copies issued. In some respects this latter work is of
greater importance than the previous one, as it covers such a vast
field, and moreover it is only the introduction of Mathers which is
important, for the text itself, the translations of parts of the
collected works called *Zohar*, leaves much to be desired. Further, the
Zoharistic commentary itself is not touched, this being left to Jean de
Pauly's French version.

Finally we have the *Aish Metzraph*, that

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

is, "the Fire which purified," but this work is deeply mystical and
little understood except by Alchemists, containing secrets of alchemy
which were known to the Jews of old.

As one of the Zoharistic works, the *Sepher Dzyaniouta* must be
mentioned, especially for its likeness to the *Stanzas of Dzyan* of the
"Secret Doctrine." This treats of what is called the "Concealed
Mystery," the doctrine of the "Balance," an Egyptian survival, probably
taken from the Egyptians together with the other jewels of which the
Israelites are said to have spoiled them. There are also other minor
works of importance, but these are generally bound up with the Zohar.
These treat of various matters, the emanations of the Deity, or
"Creation," the doctrine of Reincarnation, or Gilgool, that is,
"revolutions of the soul," and also the doctrine of Karma, or as it is
called in Hebrew, Judgments or Mischpotim. Other treatises are of a more
difficult and perhaps more dangerous character, treating of demons, and
obsessing entities, etc., as well as of Angels and elementals, and
such-like creatures.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[69:\*](moq08.htm#fr_2.md) The "East" being of
course the "Place of Light" and not a mere physical "east," for the
Wisdom is no more eastern than western, in fact the East is indebted to
the West and vice-versa, according to the time when the qabalistic
knowledge was given out or re-presented, sometimes in the west and at
others in the east.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[73:\*](moq08.htm#fr_3.md) Compiled probably by a
certain Rabbi Abraham (and not as some misread it **The Patriarch**).
