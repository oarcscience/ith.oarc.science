### CHAPTER IV

### THE PATH OF KNOWLEDGE

<span class="smallcaps">Knowledge</span> of the truths made known by
Theosophy can be gained by <span class="smallcaps">each</span> man for
himself. Descriptions of the kind given in this book present a
thought-picture of the higher worlds. And they are in a particular
respect the <span class="smallcaps">first step</span> toward personal
vision. For man is a thought-being. He can only find his path of
knowledge when he makes thinking his starting point. A picture of the
higher worlds given to his intellect is not unfruitful for him even if
for the time being it were only as an account of higher facts into which
he has not yet gained insight through his own vision. For the thoughts
which are given him represent in themselves a force which continues
working in his thought world. This force will be active in him, and it
will awaken slumbering capacities. He who is of the opinion that it is
superfluous to make oneself receptive to such a thought-picture is
mistaken.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He regards thought
as something unreal and abstract. But thought is a living force. It is
for him who has the higher knowledge a direct expression of what can be
seen in the spirit, and it therefore acts in him to whom it is
communicated like a <span class="smallcaps">germ</span>, which brings
forth from itself the fruit of knowledge.

Anyone disdaining the application of strenuous intellectual exertion to
the attainment of the higher knowledge, and preferring to make use of
other forces in man to that end, fails to take into account that
thinking is the highest of the faculties possessed by man in the world
of the senses.

To him who asks, "How can I gain personal knowledge of the higher truths
of Theosophy?" the answer must be given, "Begin by making yourself
acquainted with what is communicated by others concerning such truths."
And should he reply, "I wish to see for myself, I do not wish to know
anything about what others have seen," one must answer, "It is in the
very assimilating of the communications of others that the first step
toward personal knowledge consists." And if he should answer, "Then I am
forced to have blind faith

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

to begin with," one can only reply that in regard to something
communicated it is not a case of belief or unbelief but merely of an
unprejudiced consideration of what one hears. The theosophist never
speaks with the intention of awakening blind faith in what he says. He
merely says, "I have experienced this in the higher regions of
existence, and I narrate these my experiences." But he knows also that
the reception of these experiences by another and the penetrating of his
thoughts with such an account are living forces making for spiritual
development.

One cannot, in fact, emphasize strongly enough how necessary it is that
anyone who wishes to develop his capacity for higher knowledge should
undertake the earnest cultivation of his powers of thinking. This
emphasis must be all the stronger because many persons who wish to
become "seers" actually estimate lightly this earnest, self-denying
labor of thinking. They say, "Thinking cannot help me to reach anything;
the chief thing is 'sensation, feeling,' or something similar." In reply
it must be said that no one can in the higher sense (and that means in

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

truth) become a "seer" who has not previously accustomed himself to the
life of trained thought. In this connection a certain inner laziness
plays an injurious rôle with many persons. They do not become conscious
of this laziness because it clothes itself in a contempt of "abstract
thought" and "idle speculations," etc.

But one completely misunderstands what thinking is if one confuses it
with a spinning of idle, abstract trains of thought. For while this
"abstract thinking" can easily kill supersensible knowledge, vigorous
thinking, full of life, must be the groundwork on which it is based.

It would indeed be more comfortable if one could reach the higher power
of seeing while shunning the labor of thinking. Many would like this.
But in order to reach it there is necessary an inner firmness, an
assurance of soul to which thinking alone can lead. Otherwise there
merely results a meaningless flickering of pictures here and there, a
distracting display of soul or astral phenomena, which indeed gives
pleasure to many, but which has nothing to do with a true penetration
into the

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

higher worlds. Further, if one considers what great changes take place
in the man who really enters the higher world, one will understand that
the matter has still another aspect. Absolute <span
class="smallcaps">healthiness</span> of the soul life belongs to the
condition of being a "seer." There is no better means of developing this
healthiness than the true kind of thinking. In fact, it is possible for
the health to suffer seriously if the exercises for higher development
are not based on thinking. Although it is true that the power of
spiritual sight makes a healthy and correctly thinking man still
healthier and more capable in life, it is also true that vague dreamings
about these things, all attempts to develop while shirking the effort of
thought, are dangerous to the health both of body and soul. No one who
wishes to develop himself to higher knowledge has anything to fear if he
pay heed to what is said here, but the attempt should only be made under
the above conditions.

Unfounded disbelief is injurious. It works in the recipient as a
repelling force. It hinders him from receiving the fructifying thoughts.
Not faith, but just this reception

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

of the theosophic conceptions and teachings, is the requisite for the
development of the higher senses. The theosophist approaches his scholar
with the injunction, "You are <span class="smallcaps">not</span>
required to <span class="smallcaps">believe</span> what I tell you but
to think about it, make it part of the contents of your own thought
world, then my thoughts will work in you and of themselves enable you to
recognize them as true." This is the attitude of the teacher of
Theosophy. He gives the stimulus; the power to accept as true what is
given him springs forth from the inner being of the learner himself. And
it is with this attitude of mind that the theosophic views of life
should be studied. Anyone who has the self-control to steep his thoughts
in them may be sure that in a shorter or longer time they will lead him
to personal vision.

In what has been said here there is already indicated one of the first
qualities which everyone wishing to arrive at a personal vision of
higher facts has to develop. It is the <span
class="smallcaps">unreserved, unprejudiced, laying of oneself
open</span> to that which is revealed by human beings or the world
external to man. If a man approaches a fact in the world around

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

him with a judgment arising from his previous experiences, he shuts
himself off by this judgment from the quiet, complete effect which this
fact can have on him. The learner must be able each moment to make
himself a perfectly empty vessel into which the new world flows.
Knowledge is received only in those moments in which every judgment,
every criticism coming from ourselves, is silent. For example, when we
meet a person, the question is not at all whether we are wiser than he.
Even the most unreasoning child has something to reveal to the greatest
sage. And if he approach the child with his prejudgment, be it ever so
wise, he pushes his wisdom like a dulled glass in front of what the
child ought to reveal to him. Complete inner selflessness is necessary
for this constant accessibility to the revelations of the new world. And
if a man test himself to find out in what degree he possesses this
accessibility he will make astonishing discoveries regarding himself.
Anyone who wishes to tread the path of higher knowledge must train
himself to be able each moment to obliterate himself with all his
prejudices. As long as he obliterates himself

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

the other flows into him. Only a high grade of such selfless
accessibility enables one to receive the higher spiritual facts which
surround man on all sides. One can develop this capacity in oneself of
set purpose. One tries, for example, to refrain from passing any
judgment on people in one's neighborhood. One should obliterate within
oneself the gauge of good and bad, of stupid or clever, which one is
accustomed to apply, and try without this gauge to understand persons
purely through themselves. The best exercises can be made with people
for whom one has an aversion. One should suppress this aversion with all
one's power and let everything that they do affect one unbiased. Or, if
one is in an environment that excites this or that judgment, one should
suppress the judgment and, free from criticism, lay oneself open to
impressions. One should allow things and events to speak <span
class="smallcaps">to oneself</span> rather than speak oneself about
them. And one should extend this even to one's thought world. One should
suppress in <span class="smallcaps">oneself</span> that which prompts
this or that thought and allow only what is outside to produce the
thoughts. Only when such exercises

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

are carried out with holiest earnestness and perseverance, do they lead
to the goal of higher knowledge. He who undervalues such exercises knows
nothing of their worth. And he who has experience in such things knows
that selfless accessibility and freedom from prejudice are true
producers of force. Just as heat conducted to the steam boiler is
transformed into the motive power of the engine, the habitual exercise
of selfless, spiritual accessibility in man is transformed into the
power of seeing in the spiritual worlds.

By this exercise a man makes himself receptive to all that surrounds
him. But to this receptivity correct valuation must also be added. As
long as a man is inclined to value himself too highly, at the expense of
the world around him, he closes up the approach to higher knowledge. He
who in regard to each thing or event in the world yields himself up to
the pleasure or pain which they cause <span
class="smallcaps">him</span>, is enmeshed by such an overvaluation of
himself. For through <span class="smallcaps">his</span> pleasure and
<span class="smallcaps">his</span> pain he learns nothing about the
things but merely something about himself. If I feel sympathy with a
man, I feel to begin with

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

nothing but my relation to him. If I make myself entirely dependent on
this feeling of pleasure, of sympathy, as regards my judgment and my
conduct, I place my personality in the foreground, I obtrude it upon the
world. I wish to thrust myself into the world just as I am, instead of
accepting the world in an unbiased way and allowing it to play itself
out in accordance with the forces acting in it. In other words, I am
tolerant only of what harmonizes with my personality. Toward everything
else I exercise a repelling force. As long as a man is enmeshed by the
sensible world, he acts in an especially repelling way on all influences
that are supersensible. The learner must develop in himself the capacity
to conduct himself toward things and people in accordance with their
peculiar natures and to give to each its due worth and significance.
Sympathy and antipathy, liking and disliking must be made to play quite
new rôles. There can be no thought of eradicating these, of blunting
oneself to sympathy and antipathy. On the contrary, the more a man
develops in himself the capacity to refrain from allowing each feeling
of sympathy and antipathy to be

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

followed immediately by a judgment, an action, the more fine will be the
sensitiveness he develops in himself. He will find that sympathy and
antipathy of a higher kind awaken in him if he curb those which he
already has. Even something that is at first most unattractive has
hidden qualities; it reveals them if a man does not in his conduct obey
his selfish feelings. He who has developed himself in this respect feels
more finely in every direction than one who has not, because he does not
allow his own personality to lead him into lack of receptivity. Each
inclination that a man follows blindly blunts the power to see the
things in his environment in their true light. By obeying inclination we
thrust ourselves, as it were, through the environment instead of laying
ourselves open to it and feeling its true worth.

A man becomes independent of the <span class="smallcaps">changing</span>
impressions of the outer world when each pleasure and each pain, each
sympathy and each antipathy, no longer calls forth in him an egotistical
response and egotistical conduct. The pleasure one feels in a thing
makes one at once dependent on it. One loses oneself in

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

the thing. A man who loses himself in the pleasure or pain caused by
each varying impression cannot tread the path of higher knowledge. He
must accept pleasure and pain with <span
class="smallcaps">equanimity</span>. Then he ceases to lose himself in
them; he begins instead to understand them. A pleasure to which I
surrender myself devours my being in the moment of surrender. I ought to
use the pleasure only in order through it to arrive at an understanding
of the thing that arouses pleasure in me. The important point ought not
to be that the thing has aroused the pleasure in me; I ought to
experience the liking and through it the <span
class="smallcaps">nature</span> of the thing. The pleasure should only
be an announcement to me that there is in the thing a quality calculated
to give pleasure. This quality I must learn to understand. If I go no
further than the pleasure, if I allow myself to be entirely absorbed in
it, it is only that I am expending myself; if the pleasure is to me only
the opportunity of experiencing a quality or property of the thing
itself, I enrich my inner being through this experience. To the learner
pleasure and displeasure, joy and pain, must be <span
class="smallcaps">opportunities</span> for learning

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

about things. The learner does not become blunted to pleasure or pain
through this, he raises himself above them in order that they may reveal
to him the nature of the things. He who develops himself in this respect
will learn to understand what instructors pleasure and pain are. He will
feel with every being, and thereby receive the revelation of its inner
nature. The learner never says to himself merely, "Oh, how I suffer" or
"Oh, how glad I am," but always "How suffering speaks! How joy speaks!"
He eliminates the element of self in order that pleasure and joy from
the outer world may work on him. By this means a complete change takes
place in the man. Formerly he responded to this or that impression by
this or that action, because these impressions caused him joy or
dislike. But now he allows pleasure and displeasure to become merely the
organs by which things tell him how he should conduct himself toward
them. <span class="smallcaps">In him</span>, pleasure and pain change
from being mere feelings to being organs of sense by which the external
world is perceived. Just as the eye does not act itself when it sees
something, but allows the hand to act, so pleasure and pain

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

bring about nothing in the learner, but merely receive impressions; and
what is learned through pleasure and displeasure is that which brings
about the action.

When a man uses pleasure and displeasure in such a way that they become
mere organs of transmission, they build up for him within his soul the
very organs through which the soul world opens up to view. The eye can
serve the body only by being an organ for the transmission of sensible
impressions; pleasure and pain become the eyes of the soul when they
cease to have any value in themselves and begin to serve one purpose
alone, that of revealing to the inner soul the souls outside it.

By means of the faculties mentioned the seeker of the Path places
himself in such a condition as to enable what is really present in the
world around him to affect him without disturbing influences from his
own personality. But he has also to adapt himself to the spiritual world
around him in the right way. For he is, as thinking being, a citizen of
the spiritual world. He can be this in a right way only if he guides his
thoughts in accordance with the eternal laws of truth, the laws of the

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Spirit-land." For
only in this way can that land act on him and reveal its facts to him. A
man never reaches the truth as long as he yields to the thoughts
continuously coursing through his ego. For if he does, his thoughts take
a course imposed on them by the fact that they come into existence
within the bodily nature. The thought world of a man who is absorbed in
an intellectual activity, determined primarily by his physical brain,
has an appearance of irregularity and confusion. In it a thought enters,
breaks off, is driven out of the field by another. Any one who tests
this by listening to a conversation between two people, or who observes
himself in an unprejudiced way, will gain an idea of this mass of
will-o’-the-wisp thoughts. As long as a man devotes himself only to the
calls of the life of the senses, his confused succession of thoughts
will always be brought into order again by the facts of the reality. I
may think ever so confusedly, but in my actions everyday facts force
upon me the laws corresponding to the reality. My mental picture of a
town may be most confused, but if I wish to walk along a certain road in
the town I must accommodate myself

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

to existing facts. The mechanic can enter his workshop with ever so
varied a whirl of ideas, but the laws of his engines compel him to adopt
the correct procedure in his work. Within the world of the senses facts
exercise their continuous corrective on thought. If I think out a false
opinion about a physical phenomenon or the shape of a plant the reality
confronts me and sets my thinking right. It is quite different when I
consider my relations to the higher regions of existence. They reveal
themselves to me only if I enter their worlds with already strictly
controlled thinking. Unless my thinking shows me the right, sure
standpoint, I cannot find the proper paths. For the spiritual laws
prevailing within these worlds are not condensed into the sensibly
perceptible kind, and therefore they do not exert on me the compulsion
referred to above. I am able to obey these laws only when they are
related to those which govern me personally as a thinking being. Here I
must be my own sure guide. The seeker of the Path must therefore make
his thinking strictly regulated in character. His thoughts must by
degrees disaccustom themselves entirely from taking the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

ordinary daily course. They must in their whole sequence take on the
inner character of the spiritual world.

The seeker of the Path must constantly keep watch over himself in this
respect and have himself in hand. With him one thought must not link
itself arbitrarily with another but only in the way that corresponds
with the severely exact contents of the thought world. The transition
from one idea to another must correspond with the strict laws of
thought. He must as thinker be to a certain extent constantly a copy of
these thought laws. He must shut out from his train of thought all that
does not flow out of these laws. Should a favorite thought present
itself to him, he must put it aside if the correct sequence will be
disturbed by it. If a personal feeling tries to force upon his thoughts
a direction not inherent in them, he must suppress it. Plato required of
those who wished to be in his school that they should first go through a
course of mathematical training. And mathematics with their strict laws,
which do not yield to the course of ordinary sensible phenomena, form a
good preparation for the seeker of the Path. If he

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

wishes to make progress in the study of mathematics he has to strike out
all personal, arbitrary choice, all disturbances. He learns by it to
follow purely the requirements of the thought. And he has to learn to do
this in all his thinking. His <span
class="smallcaps">thought-life</span> must itself be a copy of the
unchanging mathematical methods of stating premises and forming
conclusions . He must strive wherever he goes and whatever he does to
think after this manner. Then the intrinsic lawfulness of the spirit
world will flow into him instead of passing over and through him without
leaving a trace, as it does when his thinking bears the ordinary
confused character. Regulated thinking brings him from sure starting
points to the most hidden truths. What has been said, however, must not
be looked at in a one-sided way. Although mathematics act as a good
discipline for the mind, one can arrive at pure, healthy thinking
without the study of mathematics.

And what the Path seeker strives to have in his thinking, he must also
strive to have in his actions. These must obey the laws of the nobly
Beautiful and the eternally True without any

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

disturbing influences from his personality. These laws must constantly
direct him. Should he begin to do something that he has recognized as
right and fail to content his personal feelings, he may not <span
class="smallcaps">for that reason</span> forsake the road he has entered
on. But, on the other hand, he may not pursue it because it gives him
joy if he finds that it is not in accordance with the laws of the
eternally Beautiful and True. In everyday life people allow their
actions to be decided by what contents them personally, by what bears
fruit <span class="smallcaps">for themselves</span>. In this way they
force upon the course of the world's events a direction influenced by
their personality. They do not bring to realization the True that is
already prescribed in the laws of the spirit world, they realize the
demands of their self-will. They act in harmony with the spiritual world
only when they follow its laws alone. The Path seeker may not ask, "What
brings me advantages, what will bring me success?" but only, "What have
I recognized as the Good?" Renunciation of the fruits of action in the
interest of his personality, renunciation of all self-will, these are
the weighty laws

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

which he must prescribe for himself. Then he treads the paths of the
spiritual world, his whole being becomes penetrated by these laws. He
becomes free from all compulsion from the sensible world; his Spirit-man
raises itself out of the sensible sheath. Thus he makes actual progress
on the path toward the spiritual, and thus he spiritualizes himself. One
cannot say, "Of what use to me are all my resolutions to follow purely
the laws of the True when I am perhaps mistaken as to what is the True?"
The important thing is the striving and the spirit in which one strives.
Even he who is mistaken possesses in his very striving after the True a
force which turns him away from the wrong road. This force seizes him
should he be mistaken and guides him to the right road. The very
objection, "But I can be mistaken," is itself harmful unbelief. It shows
that the man has no confidence in the power of the True. For the
important point is that he should not presume to decide on his aims and
objects in life in accordance with his egotistical views, but that he
should selflessly yield himself up to the guidance of the spirit itself.
It is not the

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

self-seeking will of man that can prescribe for the True; on the
contrary <span class="smallcaps">this true itself</span> must become
lord in man, must penetrate his whole being, make him a copy of the
eternal laws of the Spirit-land. He must fill himself with these eternal
laws in order to let them stream out into life. As the Path seeker must
hold strict guard over his thinking, so must he also over his <span
class="smallcaps">will</span>. Through this he becomes in life a
messenger from the world of the True and the Beautiful. And through
becoming this he rises to be a participant in the spirit world. Through
this he is raised from stage to stage of development. For one cannot
reach the spiritual life by merely seeing it; on the contrary, one has
to reach it by experiencing, by living it.

If the Path seeker observes the laws here described his soul experiences
will take on an entirely new form. He will not longer live merely <span
class="smallcaps">in them</span>. They will no longer have a
significance merely for his personal life. They will develop into soul
perceptions of the higher world. In his soul the feelings of pleasure
and displeasure, of joy and pain, grow into soul organs, just as in his
body eyes and ears

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

do not lead a life for themselves merely, but selflessly allow external
impressions to pass through them. As a result <span
class="smallcaps">calmness</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">assurance</span> become inherent qualities in the soul
of the Path seeker. A great pleasure will no longer make him jubilant,
but will be the messenger to him of qualities in the world which have
hitherto escaped him. It will leave him calm, and through the calm the
characteristics of the pleasure-giving beings will reveal themselves to
him. Pain will no longer fill him with grief, but will tell him the
qualities of the being which causes the pain. Just as the eye does not
desire anything for itself but shows man the direction of the road he
has to take, so will pleasure and pain guide the soul safely along its
path. This is the state of balance of soul which the Path seeker must
reach. The less pleasure and pain exhaust themselves in waves which they
throw up in the inner life of the Path seeker, the more will they form
eyes for the supersensible world. As long as a man lives in pleasure and
pain he cannot <span class="smallcaps">gain knowledge</span> through
them. When he learns through them how to live, when he withdraws from

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

them his feeling of self, then they become his organs of perception,
then he sees by means of them, and through them attains to knowledge. It
is incorrect to think that the Seeker of the Path becomes a dry,
colorless being, incapable of pleasure or suffering. Pleasure and
suffering are present in him but in a transformed shape; they have
become "eyes and ears."

So long as one lives in a personal relationship with the world, things
reveal only that which links them with our personality. But that is the
transitory part of them. If we withdraw ourselves from the transitory
part of us and live with our feeling of self, with our "I," in our
permanent part, then our transitory parts become intermediaries for us;
and that which reveals itself through them is an Imperishable, an
Eternal in the things. This relationship between HIS own Eternal and the
Eternal in the things must be established by the seeker of the Path.
Even before he begins other exercises of the kind described, and also
during them, he should direct his thought to this imperishable part.
When I observe a stone, a plant, an animal, a man, I

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

should remember that in each of them an Eternal declares itself. I must
ask myself what is the permanent that lives in the transitory stone,
what will outlast the transient, sensible phenomenon? One ought not to
think that such a directing of the spirit to the eternal destroys the
power of devoted observation and our feeling for the qualities of
everyday affairs, and estranges us from the immediate realities. On the
contrary every leaf, every little insect will unveil to us innumerable
mysteries, when not our <span class="smallcaps">eyes</span> only but
<span class="smallcaps">through the eyes</span> the spirit is directed
upon them. Every sparkle, every shade of color, every cadence will
remain vividly perceptible to the senses; nothing will be lost; only an
infinitude is gained. Indeed, the person who is not able to observe even
the meanest thing in nature with interest will only attain to pale,
bloodless thoughts, not to spiritual sight. All depends on the <span
class="smallcaps">attitude of mind</span> we acquire in this direction.

What stage we will succeed in reaching depends on our capacities. We
have each moment to do what is right and leave everything else to the
future. It must be enough

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

for us at first to direct our minds to the permanent. If we do this the
knowledge of the permanent will <span class="smallcaps">through
this</span> awaken in us. We must wait until it is given. And it is
given at the right time to each one who with patience waits and works. A
man soon notices during such exercises what a powerful transformation
takes place within him. He learns to consider each thing as important or
unimportant only in so far as he recognizes it to be related to a
Permanent, to an Eternal. He comes to a different appreciation and
estimate of the world from the one he has hitherto had. His whole
feeling takes on a new relationship toward the entire surrounding world.
The transitory no longer attracts him for its own sake as formerly; it
becomes for him a member, an image of the Eternal. And this Eternal,
that lives in all things, he learns to love. It becomes familiar to him,
just as the transitory was formerly familiar to him. This again does not
cause him to become estranged from life, he only learns to value each
thing at its true worth. Even the vain trifles of life will not leave
him quite unaffected; but the man no longer loses himself in them, he
recognizes

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

them at their limited worth. He sees them in their true light. He is a
poor discerner who prefers to go awandering in the clouds and lose sight
of life; a true discerner from his high summit, with his power of clear
survey and his just and healthy feeling for everything, will be able to
assign to each thing its proper place.

In this way there opens out to the Path seeker the possibility of
ceasing to obey the incalculable influences of the external world of the
senses, which turn his will now here, now there. Through higher
knowledge he has seen the Eternal Being in things. By means of the
transformation of his inner world he has gained the capacity to perceive
this eternal being. When he now acts from out himself, he acts also from
out the Eternal Being of the things. For the things give utterance <span
class="smallcaps">in him</span> to this being of theirs. He therefore
acts in harmony with the eternal World Order when he directs his action
from out the Eternal living within him. He becomes in this way no longer
impelled by the things, he impels them according to the laws implanted
within them which have become the laws of his own being.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

This ability to act from out his inner being can only be an ideal toward
which one strives. The attainment of the goal lies in the far distance.
But the Path seeker must have the will to tread this road. This is his
<span class="smallcaps">will for freedom</span>. For freedom is action
from out of one's inner being. And only he may act from out of his inner
being who draws his motives from the Eternal. He who does not do this
acts according to other motives than those implanted in the things. Such
a one opposes the World Order. And this must prevail against him. That
is to say, what he plans to carry through by his will can not take
place. He can not become free. The arbitrary choice of the individual
annihilates itself through the effects of its deeds.

\*          \*          \*

He who directs his inner life in such a way steps upward from stage to
stage. The fruits of his exercises will be that certain vistas of the
supersensible world will unfold to his spiritual perception. He learns
the real meaning of the truth communicated about this world; and he will
receive confirmation of them through his own experience. If this

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

stage is reached, an experience comes to him which can only be his
through treading this path.

Through Beings whose significance can now for the first time become
clear to him through the "great Guides of the Human Race" there is
bestowed on him what is called consecration (initiation). He becomes a
"Disciple of the Wisdom." What the Seeker of the Path now experiences
can only be indicated here. He receives a new home. He becomes a
conscious dweller in the supersensible world. The River of Wisdom flows
to him now from a higher source. The Light of Knowledge from this time
forth does not shine upon him from without; he is himself placed in the
fountain eye of this Light. In it the problems which the world supplies
are solved. Henceforth he holds converse no longer with the things which
are shaped through the spirit, but with the Shaping Spirit itself. The
separate life of the personality only exists now in order to be a
conscious image of the Eternal. Every lingering doubt that could
formerly arise in him vanishes; for only he can doubt whom things delude
regarding the spirit that rules in them.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

And since the "Disciple of the Wisdom" is able to hold intercourse with
the spirit itself, each false form in which he had before imagined the
spirit vanishes. The false form which man ascribes to the spirit in his
conceptions is superstition. The initiate is above all superstition, for
he knows what the true form of the spirit is. <span
class="smallcaps">Freedom</span> from personality, doubt, and
superstition, these are the characteristics of him who has attained to
discipleship in the Path of the higher knowledge. One must not confuse
this state in which the personality becomes one with the comprehensive
spirit of life with a <span class="smallcaps">disappearance of the
personality</span> in the "All-Spirit." Such a disappearance does not
take place in a true development of the personality. It remains
preserved as personality at the highest stage of its perfection. It is
not the subjection of the personality but its highest development that
takes place. If one wishes to have a simile for this coincidence or
union of the individual spirit with the "All-Spirit" one cannot choose
that of different circles which, coinciding, are lost in the One, but
one must choose the picture of many circles of which each has a quite

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

distinct shade of color; these differently colored circles coincide, but
<span class="smallcaps">each</span> separate shade preserves its
existence within the whole. Not one loses the fullness of its individual
power, and the whole is the resultant of these individual powers.

The further description of the Path will not be given here. It is given
so far as is possible in "Occult Science," which forms a continuation of
this book.

The Way of Man passes through many lives (incarnations). <span
class="smallcaps">Patience</span> ought to flow out of the real
understanding of this fact. He who uses his present incarnation for his
development prepares for those stages in which he will attain to
(intuitive) seeing, to clairvoyance, to the full possession of his
higher being (Spirit-self, Life-spirit) as well as to the remembrance of
his former lives and to still higher experiences. It is possible for
this to take place in his present life or perhaps, it may be, in a
following one.
