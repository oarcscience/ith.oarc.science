# THEOSOPHY

### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">When Johann Gottlieb Fichte</span>, in the
autumn of 1813, gave to the world his "Introduction to the Science of
Knowledge" as the ripe fruit of a life wholly devoted to the service of
truth, he said, at the very beginning: "This science presupposes an
entirely new inner sense organ or instrument, by means of which there is
revealed a new world which does not exist for the ordinary man." And he
proceeded to give the following comparison to show how incomprehensible
this doctrine of his must be when judged by means of conceptions founded
on the ordinary senses: "Think of a world of people born blind, who
therefore know only those objects and relations which exist through the
sense of touch. Go among them and speak to them of colors and the other

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

relations which exist only through light and for the sense of sight.
Either you convey nothing to their minds, and this is the more fortunate
if they tell you so, for you will in that way quickly notice the mistake
and, if unable to open their eyes, will cease the useless speaking. …"
Now those who speak to people about such things as Fichte deals with in
this instance find themselves only too often in a position like that of
a man who can see among the born blind. But these are things that refer
to man's true being and highest goal, and to believe it necessary "to
cease the useless speaking" would amount to despairing of humanity. On
the contrary, one should not for one moment doubt the possibility of
opening the eyes of everyone to these things, provided that he is in
earnest in the matter. On this supposition have all those written and
spoken who felt that within themselves the "inner sense-instrument" had
grown by which they were able to know the true nature and being of man,
which is hidden from the outer senses. This is why from the most ancient
times such a "Hidden Wisdom" has been again and again spoken of. Those
who have grasped something

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

of it feel just as sure of their possession as people with normal eyes
feel sure that they possess the conception of color. For them this
"Hidden Wisdom" requires no "proof." They know also that it requires no
proof for any other person who, like themselves, has unfolded the
"higher sense." Such a one can speak as a traveler can about America to
people who have not themselves seen that country, but who can form a
conception of it because they would see all that he has seen if the
opportunity presented itself to them.

But not only to such has the investigator of the higher truth to speak.
He must address his words to all mankind. For he has to make known
things that concern all humanity. Indeed he knows that without a
knowledge of these things no one can, in the true sense of the word, be
a "human being." And he speaks to all mankind because he knows that
there are different grades of understanding for what he has to say. He
knows that even those who are still far from the moment in which they
will themselves be capable of spiritual investigation can bring a
certain measure of understanding to meet him. For the A<span
class="smallcaps">feeling</span> for

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

truth and the power of <span class="smallcaps">understanding</span> it
is inherent in <span class="smallcaps">every</span> human being. And to
this <span class="smallcaps">understanding</span>, which can flash forth
in every healthy soul, he in the first place addresses himself. He also
knows that in this <span class="smallcaps">understanding</span> there is
a force which, little by little, must lead to the higher grades of <span
class="smallcaps">knowledge</span>. This feeling, which perhaps at first
sees <span class="smallcaps">nothing at all</span> of that which is told
it, is itself the magician which opens the "eye of the spirit." In
darkness this feeling stirs; the soul does not <span
class="smallcaps">see</span>, but through this feeling it is seized by
the <span class="smallcaps">power</span> of <span class="smallcaps">the
truth</span>; and then the truth will gradually draw nearer to the soul
and open in it the "higher sense." For one person it may take a longer,
for another a shorter time, but everyone who has patience and endurance
reaches this goal. For although not every physical eye can be operated
on, <span class="smallcaps">every spiritual eye</span> can be opened,
and when it will be opened is only a question of time.

Erudition and scientific training are not essential to the unfolding of
this "higher sense." It can be developed in the simpleminded person just
as in the scientist of high

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

standing. Indeed, what is often called at the present time "the only
true science" can, for the attainment of this goal, be a hindrance
rather than a help. For this science too often permits to be considered
"real" only what is perceptible to the ordinary senses. And however
great its merit is in regard to the knowledge of <span
class="smallcaps">that</span> reality, it creates at the same time a
mass of prejudices which close the approach to higher realities.

In objection to what is said here it is often brought forward that
"insurmountable limits" have been once and forever set to human
knowledge, and that, since one cannot pass beyond these limits, all
branches of investigation and knowledge which do not take them into
account must be rejected. And a person who wishes to make assertions
about things which many regard as proved to lie beyond the limits that
have been set to human capacities of knowledge, is looked upon as highly
presumptuous. Those who make such objections entirely disregard the fact
that a <span class="smallcaps">development</span> of the human powers of
knowledge has to precede the higher knowledge. What lies beyond the
limits of knowledge <span class="smallcaps">before</span>

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

such a development is, after the awakening of faculties slumbering in
each human being, entirely <span class="smallcaps">within</span> the
realm of knowledge. One point in this connection must, indeed, not be
neglected. One could say, "Of what use is it to speak to people about
things for which their powers of knowledge are not yet awakened, and
which are therefore still closed to them?" But that is also the wrong
way to look at it. One requires certain faculties to <span
class="smallcaps">find out</span> the things referred to; but if, after
having been found out, they are made known, <span
class="smallcaps">every person</span> can understand who is willing to
bring to bear upon them unprejudiced logic and a healthy instinct for
truth. In this book the things made known are of no other kind than such
as can produce the impression that through them the riddle of human life
and the phenomena of the world find a satisfying explanation. This it
can do on anyone who allows thinking that looks at all sides of a
subject and is unclouded by prejudice, and a feeling for truth that is
free, and sets no reserves, to take effect. Let one merely place himself
in the attitude of asking, "If the things that are asserted here are
true, do they afford a satisfying

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

explanation of life?" and one will find that the life of each human
being supplies the confirmation.

In order to be a "teacher" in these higher regions of existence, it is
by no means sufficient that a person has developed the sense for them.
For that purpose "science" is necessary, just as much as it is necessary
for the teacher's calling in the region of ordinary reality. "Higher
seeing" alone makes a "knower" in the spiritual just as little as
healthy sense organs make a "scholar" in regard to the sensible
realities. And because in truth <span class="smallcaps">all</span>
reality, the lower and the higher spiritual, are only two sides of one
and the same fundamental essence, anyone who is unlearned in the lower
branches of knowledge will as a rule remain so in regard to the higher.
This fact creates a feeling of responsibility that is immeasurable in
him who, by a spiritual call, is destined to be a teacher in the
spiritual regions of existence. It creates in him humility and
reservedness. But it should deter no one from occupying himself with the
higher truths, not even him whose other circumstances of life afford no
opportunity for the study of ordinary science.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For one can,
indeed, fulfill one's task as a human being without understanding
anything of botany, zoölogy, mathematics, and other sciences; but one
cannot, in the full sense of the word, be a "human" being without
having, in some way or other, come near to a perception of the nature
and destination of man revealed in the "Higher Wisdom."

The highest to which a man is able to look up he calls the "Divine." And
he has in some way or other to bring his highest destination into
connection with this Divinity. For this reason the higher wisdom which
reveals to him his own being, and with it his destination, may very well
be called "Divine Wisdom," or <span class="smallcaps">theosophy</span>.

From the point of view here indicated there will be sketched in this
book an outline of the theosophical interpretation of the universe. The
writer of it will present nothing that is not a <span
class="smallcaps">fact</span> for him, in the same sense as an
experience of the outer world is a fact for eyes and ears and the
ordinary intelligence. Indeed, experiences will be dealt with which
become accessible to each person who is determined to tread the "path of
knowledge" described in a special section of this work.
