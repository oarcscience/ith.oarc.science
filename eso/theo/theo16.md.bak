#### 5. THE PHYSICAL WORLD AND ITS CONNECTION WITH THE SOUL AND SPIRIT LANDS

The formations of the Soul World and the "Spirit-land" cannot be the
objects of external sense perception. The objects of <span
class="smallcaps">this</span> perception

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

are to be added to the two already described as a third world. Man lives
during his bodily existence simultaneously in the three worlds. He
perceives the things of the sensible world and acts upon them. The
formations of the soul world act on him through their forces of sympathy
and antipathy; and his own soul excites waves in the soul world by its
inclinations and disinclinations, its wishes and desires. The spiritual
being of things, on the other hand, mirrors itself in his thought world
and he himself is, as thinking spirit being, citizen of the
"Spirit-land" and participant of all that lives in this region of the
universe. This makes it clear that the sensible world is only a part of
that which surrounds man. This part stands out from the general
surroundings of man with a certain independence because it can be
perceived by senses which leave disregarded the soul and spiritual parts
which belong just as much to the surrounding world. Even as a piece of
ice floating on the water is of the same matter as the surrounding water
but stands out from it owing to particular qualities, so are the things
of the senses matter of the surrounding soul and spirit

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

worlds; and they stand out from these owing to particular qualities
which make them perceptible to the senses. They are, to speak half
metaphorically, condensed spirit and soul formations; and the
condensation makes it possible for the senses to acquire knowledge of
them. In fact, as ice is only a form in which the water exists, so are
the objects of the senses only a form in which soul and spirit beings
exist. If one has grasped this, one can also understand that as water
can pass over into ice, so the spirit world can pass over into the soul
world, and the latter into that of the senses. Looking at the matter
from this point of view leads us to the reason why man can form thoughts
about the things of the senses. For there is a question which everyone
who thinks would have to ask himself, namely, in what relation does the
thought which a man has about a stone stand to the stone itself? This
question rises in full clearness in the minds of those persons who look
especially deeply into external nature. They feel the consonance of the
human thought world with the structure and order of nature. The great
astronomer Kepler, for example, speaks in a beautiful

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

way about this harmony, "True it is that the divine call which bids man
study astronomy is written in the world, not indeed in words and
syllables, but in the very fact that human conceptions and senses are
fitted to gauge the relationships of the heavenly bodies and their
conditions." Only because the things of the sensible world are nothing
else than condensed spirit beings is the man who raises himself through
his thought to these spirit beings able by thinking to understand the
things. Sense objects originate in the spirit world; they are only
another <span class="smallcaps">form</span> of the spirit beings. And
when man forms thoughts about things he merely looks up from the
sensible form to the spiritual Archetypes of the things. To understand
an object by means of thought is a process which can be likened to that
by which a solid body is first liquefied by fire in order that the
chemist may be able to examine it in its liquid form.

The spiritual Archetypes of the sensible world are to be found (pp.
[131](theo14.htm#page_131) *et seq*..md) in the different regions of the
"Spirit-land." In the fifth, sixth, and seventh regions these Archetypes
remain in the condition of living Germ

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

points; in the four lower regions they shape themselves into spiritual
formations. The human spirit perceives a shadowy reflection of these
spiritual formations when, by thinking, he tries to gain understanding
of the things of the senses. How these formations have condensed until
they form the sensible world is a question for him who strives toward a
spiritual [understanding](errata.htm#6.md) of the world around him. For
human sense perception this surrounding world is divided into four
distinctly separated stages, the mineral, the plant, the animal, and the
human.

The mineral kingdom is perceived by the senses and comprehended by
thought. Thus when one forms a thought about a mineral body one has to
do with two things, the sense object and the thought. In accordance with
this, one is brought to the conception that this sense object is a
condensed thought being. Now one mineral being acts on another in an
external way. It impinges on it and moves it; it warms it, lights it up,
dissolves it, etc. This external kind of action can be expressed through
thoughts. A man forms thoughts as to the way in which mineral things act
on each

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

other externally and in accordance with their laws. By this means his
separate thoughts expand to a thought picture of the whole mineral
world. And this thought picture is a gleam, a reflection of the
Archetype of the whole mineral world of the senses. It is to be found
<span class="smallcaps">as a complete whole</span> in the spirit world.

In the plant kingdom there is added to the external action of one thing
on another, the phenomena of growth and propagation. The plant grows and
brings forth from itself beings like itself. <span
class="smallcaps">Life</span> is here added to what man meets with in
the mineral kingdom. A simple recollection of this fact leads to an
expression which is enlightening in this connection. The plant has in
itself the power to give itself its <span
class="smallcaps"></span>living shape, and to reproduce this shape in a
being of its own kind. And in between the shapeless kinds of mineral
matter, as we meet them in gases, liquids, etc., and the living shape of
the plant world, stand the forms of the crystal. In the crystal we have
the transition from the shapeless mineral world to the plant kingdom,
which has the capacity for forming living shapes. In this externally

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

sensible formative process in both kingdoms, the mineral and the plant,
one sees condensed to its sensible expression the purely spiritual
process which takes place when the spiritual Germs of the higher regions
of the "Spirit-land" form themselves into the spirit shapes of the lower
regions. The process of crystallization corresponds to its Archetype in
the spirit world, the transition from the formless spirit Germ to the
<span class="smallcaps">shaped formation</span>. If this transition
condenses so that the senses can perceive it, it exhibits itself in the
world of the senses as the process of crystallization.

Now there is in the plant being a shaped spirit Germ also. But here the
living, shaping capacity is still retained in the shaped being. In the
crystal the spirit Germ has lost its constructing power during the
process of shaping. It has exhausted its energies in the shape produced.
The plant has shape and, in addition to that, it has the capacity of
producing a shape. The characteristic of the spirit Germs in the higher
regions of the "Spirit-land" has been preserved in the plant life. The
plant is therefore shape, as is the crystal, and, added to that, shaping
or formative force.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

Besides the form which the Primal Beings have taken in the plant shape
there works at the latter yet another form which bears the impress of
the spirit being of the higher regions. Only that which expends itself
on the produced shape of the plant is sensibly perceptible; the
formative Beings who give life to this shape are present in the plant
kingdom in a way not perceptible to the senses. The physical eye sees
the lily small to-day, and after some time grown larger. The forming
force which elaborates the latter out of the former cannot be seen by
this eye. This formative Force Being is that part of the plant world
which acts imperceptibly to the senses. The spirit Germs have descended
a stage in order to work in the kingdom of shapes. In Theosophy,
Elementary Kingdoms are spoken of. If one designate the Primal Forms,
which as yet have no shape, as the <span class="smallcaps">First
Elementary Kingdom</span>, then the sensibly invisible Force Beings, who
work as the craftsmen of plant growth, belong to the <span
class="smallcaps">Second Elementary Kingdom</span>.

In the animal world sensation and impulse are added to the capacities
for growth and

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

propagation. These are externalizations of the <span
class="smallcaps">soul world</span>. A being endowed with these belongs
to the soul world, receives impressions from it and reacts on it. Every
sensation, every impulse, which arises in an animal is brought forth
from the foundations of the animal soul. The shape is more enduring than
the feeling or impulse. One may say the sensation life bears the same
relation to the more enduring living shape that the self-changing plant
shape bears to the rigid crystal. The plant to a certain extent exhausts
itself as the shape-forming force; during its life it goes on constantly
adding new shapes to itself. First it sends out the root, then the leaf
structure, then the flowers, etc. The animal possesses a shape complete
in itself and develops within this the ever-changing life of feeling and
impulses. And this life has its existence in the soul world. Just as the
plant is that which grows and propagates itself, the animal is that
which feels and develops its impulses. They constitute for the animal
the formless which is always developing into new forms. Their Archetypal
processes when traced to their primal source are found in the highest
regions of

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Spirit-land." But
they carry out their activities in the soul world. There are thus in the
animal world, in addition to the Force Beings who, invisible to the
senses, direct growth and propagation, others that have descended into
the soul world, a stage still deeper. In the animal kingdom formless
Beings, who clothe themselves in soul sheaths, are present as the master
builders, bringing about sensations and impulses. They are the real
architects of the animal forms. In theosophy one calls the region to
which they belong the <span class="smallcaps">Third Elementary
Kingdom</span>.

Man, in addition to having the capacities named as those of plants and
animals, is furnished also with the power of working up his sensations
into ideas and thoughts and of controlling his impulses by thinking. The
thought which appears in the plant as shape and in the animal as soul
force makes its appearance in him in its own form as thought itself. The
animal is soul; man is spirit. The Spirit Being, which in the animal is
engaged in soul development, has now descended a stage deeper still. In
man it has entered into the world of sensible matter itself. The spirit

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

is present within the human sensible body. And because it appears in a
sensible garment, it can appear only as that shadowy gleam or reflection
which the thought of the Spirit Being affords. The spirit manifests in
man through the apparatus of the physical brain mechanism. But at the
same time it has become the inner being of man. The animal feels and
moves as it chooses, but exhibits no thoughts. Thought is the form which
the formless Spirit Being assumes in man just as it is shape in the
plant and soul in the animal. Consequently man, in so far as he is a
thinking being, has no Elementary Kingdom constructing him from without.
His Elementary Kingdom works in his physical body. Only in so far as man
is shape and sentient being, do Elementary Beings work at him in the
same way as they work at plants and animals. The thought organism of man
is developed entirely from within his physical body. In the spirit
organism of man, in his nervous system which has developed into the
perfect brain, we have sensibly visible before us that which works on
plants and animals as supersensible Force Being. This brings about the
fact that the

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

animal shows feeling of self, but man consciousness of self. In the
animal, spirit feels itself to be soul; it does not yet comprehend
itself as spirit. In man the spirit recognizes itself as spirit,
although, owing to the physical apparatus, merely as a shadowy gleam or
reflection of the spirit, as thought.

Accordingly, the threefold world falls into the following divisions: 1.
The Kingdom of the Archetypal formless Beings (First Elementary
Kingdom); 2. The Kingdom of the Shape-creating Beings (Second Elementary
Kingdom); 3. The Kingdom of the Soul Beings (Third Elementary Kingdom);
4. The Kingdom of the Created Shapes (crystal forms); 5. The Kingdom
that becomes perceptible to the senses in shapes, but in which the
Shape-creating Beings are working (Plant Kingdom); 6. The Kingdom which
becomes sensibly perceptible in shapes, on which work the Shape-creating
Beings, and also the Beings that expend all their activities in the soul
life (Animal Kingdom); 7. The Kingdom which becomes sensibly perceptible
in shapes on which work the Shape-creating Beings and also the Beings
that expend all their activities

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

in soul life, and in which the spirit itself takes shape in the form of
thought within the world of the senses (Human Kingdom).

From this can be seen how the basic constituents of the human being
living in the body are connected with the spiritual world. The physical
body, the ether body, the sentient soul body, and the intellectual soul,
are to be regarded as Archetypes of the "Spirit-land" condensed in the
sensible world. The physical body comes into existence in that the
Archetype of man is so condensed that it can manifest itself to the
senses. For this reason one can call this physical body also a Being of
the First Elementary Kingdom, condensed to sensible perceptibility. The
ether-body comes into existence in that the shape that has arisen in
this way has its mobility retained by a Being that extends its activity
into the kingdom of the senses but is not itself visible to the senses.
If one wishes to characterize this Being fully, one must say it has its
primal origin in the highest regions of the "Spirit-land" and then
shapes itself in the second region into an Archetype of life. It works
in the sensible world as such an Archetype of life. In a similar

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

way the Being that constructs the sentient soul-body has its origin in
the highest regions of the "Spirit-land," forms itself in the third
region of the same into the Archetype of the soul world and works as
such in the sensible world. But the intellectual soul is formed in that
the Archetype of thinking man shapes itself in the fourth region of the
"Spirit-land" into thought, and as such acts directly as thinking human
being in the world of the senses. Thus man stands within the world of
the senses; thus works the spirit on his physical-body, on his
ether-body, and on his sentient soul-body. Thus comes this spirit into
manifestation in the intellectual soul. Archetypes in the form of Beings
who in a certain sense are external to man work upon the three lower
components of his being; in his intellectual soul he himself becomes a
(conscious) worker on himself. The Beings working on his physical-body
are the same as those who form the mineral nature. On his ether-body
work Beings living in the plant kingdom, on his sentient soul-body work
Beings who live in the animal kingdom imperceptible by the

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

senses, but who extend their activity into these kingdoms.

Thus do the different worlds combine in action. The universe in which
man lives is the expression of this combined activity.

When a person has thoroughly grasped this view of the sensible world he
gains also an understanding of Beings of another kind than those that
have their existence in the above mentioned four kingdoms of nature. One
example of such Beings is what one calls the Folk Spirit, or National
Spirit. This Being does not manifest himself directly in a sensibly
perceptible way. He lives and carries on his activities entirely in the
sensations, feelings, tendencies, etc., which one observes as those
common to a whole nation. He is therefore a Being that does not
incarnate physically, but forms his body out of the matter of the soul
world, even as man forms his body out of sensibly visible matter. This
soul body of the National Spirit is like a cloud in which the members of
a nation live. The effects of his activity come into evidence in the
souls of the human beings concerned, but he does not originate in these
souls themselves. The National

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

Spirit remains merely a shadowy conception of the mind without being or
life, an empty abstraction, to him who does not picture it in this way.
And the same may be said in reference to what one calls the Spirit of
the Age (*Zeitgeist*). The spiritual outlook, in fact, is through this,
extended over a variety of other beings, both lower and higher, who live
in the environment of man without his being able to perceive them with
his bodily senses. But those who have powers of spiritual sight perceive
such beings and can describe them. To the lower kinds belong those
designated by the spiritual investigator, as salamanders, sylphs,
undines, and gnomes. It is quite to be understood that anyone who is
inclined to admit the validity of physical vision only, regards such
beings as the offspring of a wild hallucination and superstition. They
can of course never become visible to the physical eye for they have no
physical bodies. The superstition does not consist in regarding such
beings as real, but in believing that they appear in a way perceptible
to the physical senses. Beings with such forms coöperate in the building
of the world, and one comes into connection with

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

them as soon as one enters the higher regions closed to the bodily
senses. Mention must also be made of those beings who do not descend to
the soul world, but whose vestment is composed of the formations of the
"Spirit-land" alone. Man perceives them and becomes their companion when
he opens his spiritual eye and spiritual ear to them. Many things at
which without these organs man can only gaze uncomprehendingly, become,
when he has brought them into use, understandable to him. It becomes
bright around him, he sees the Primal Causes of that which is working
itself out as effects in the world of the senses. He comprehends what he
either denied entirely when he had no spiritual eye, or in reference to
which he had to content himself with saying, "There are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamed of in thy philosophy." People with
fine—with spiritual—feelings become uneasy when they begin to have a
glimmering, become vaguely aware of another world than the sensible one
around them, and one within which they have to grope about as the blind
grope among visible objects. Nothing but the clear

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

vision of these higher regions of existence and a thorough understanding
and penetration of what takes place in them can really fortify a man and
lead him to his proper goal. Only through insight into that which is
hidden from the senses does the human being understand the world and
himself.
