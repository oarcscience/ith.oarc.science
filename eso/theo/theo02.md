### TRANSLATOR'S FOREWORD

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is significant of the movement of
thought in our time that, although the previous works of Rudolf Steiner,
Ph.D. Vienna, such as his penetrating and suggestive "*Erkenntniss
Theorie*" (Theory of Knowledge), his works in the field of philosophy
such as "*Wahrheit and Wissenschaft*" (Truth and Science), and his
volumes on the natural science of Goethe, are well known in Germany, it
is another class of books by him, "*Die Mystik*" (Mysticism), "*Das
Christentum als Mystische Tatsache*" (Christianity as a Fact in
Mysticism), and his distinctively theosophic writings, which are the
first to be called for by foreign readers in their own language.

This work, though now appearing for the first time in English dress, has
not only passed into three editions in Germany, but has been translated
into Russian, Swedish, Dutch, Czechish, and Italian, while a French
translation is being prepared.

\*          \*          \*

It were perhaps well to mention that in

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

this work the words "know" and "knowledge," when used in reference to
the supersensible worlds, involve actual experience of them gained by
man through his higher organs of perception.

The names chosen by the author to describe the higher bodies of man, and
other theosophic facts, have been, as far as possible, retained here.
Readers will find that they revert with primitive strength to the
ancient power of names, and are word pictures and also mnemonics of what
they represent. They thus constitute distinct forces too valuable to be
withheld from the English reading public.

Grateful acknowledgment must be expressed here to I. M. M. for her
chivalrous help—which indeed made this translation possible—and to
others who have rendered invaluable and willing assistance.
