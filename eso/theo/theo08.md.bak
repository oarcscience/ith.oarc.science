#### 2. THE SOUL BEING OF MAN

The soul being of man differs from his corporality through being his own
inner world. This inner world peculiar to each person faces one the
moment one directs one's attention to the simplest sensation. One finds,
in the first place, that no one can know if another person perceives
even the simplest sensation in exactly the same way as one does oneself.
It is known that there are people who are colorblind. They see things
only in different shades of gray. Others are partially colorblind. They
are unable, because of this, to perceive certain shades of colors. The
picture of the world which their eyes give them is different from that
of so-called normal persons.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the same holds
good in regard to the other senses. It will be seen, therefore, without
further elaboration, that even simple sensations belong to the inner
world. I can perceive with my bodily senses the red table which another
person also perceives; but I cannot perceive his sensation of red. One
must therefore describe sensation as belonging to the <span
class="smallcaps">soul</span>. If one grasps this fact alone quite
clearly, he will soon cease to regard inner experiences <span
class="smallcaps">as mere</span> brain processes or something similar.
The first result of sensation is <span class="smallcaps">feeling</span>.
One sensation causes man pleasure, another displeasure. These are
stirrings of his inner, his soul life. Man creates in his feelings a
second world in addition to that which works on him from without. And a
third is added to this—the will. Through it man reacts on the outer
world. And he thereby stamps the impress of his inner being on the outer
world. The soul of man, as it were, flows outward in the activities of
his will. The actions of the human being differ from the occurrences of
outer nature in that they bear the impress of his inner life. In this
way the <span class="smallcaps">soul</span> represents what is man's own
in

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

contradistinction to the outer world. He receives from the outer world
the incitements; but he creates, in responding to these incitements, a
world of his own. The corporality becomes the foundation of the soul
being of man.
