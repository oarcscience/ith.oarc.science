### VII

### THE PRINCIPLE OF GUIDANCE

IF I were asked which of all the spiritual principles ranked first, I
should feel inclined to say the Principle of Guidance; not in the sense
of being more essential than the others, for every portion is equally
essential to the completeness of a perfect whole, but in the sense of
being first in order of sequence and giving value to all our other
powers by placing them in their due relation to one another. "Giving
value to our other powers," I say, because this also is one of our
powers. It is that which, judged from the standpoint of personal
self-consciousness, is above us; but which, realised from the point of
view of the unity of all Spirit, is part and parcel of ourselves,
because it is that Infinite Mind which is of necessity identified with
all its manifestations.

Looking to this Infinite Mind as a Superior Intelligence from which we
may receive guidance does not therefore imply looking to an external
source. On the contrary, it is looking to the innermost spring of our
own being, with a confidence in its action which enables us to proceed
to the execution of our plans

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

with a firmness and assurance that are in themselves the very guarantee
of our success.

The action of the spiritual principles in us follows the order which we
impose upon them by our thought; therefore the order of realisation will
reproduce the order of desire; and if we neglect this first principle of
right order and guidance, we shall find ourselves beginning to put forth
other great powers, which are at present latent within us, without
knowing how to find suitable employment for them--which would be a very
perilous condition, for without having before us objects worthy of the
powers to which we awake, we should waste them on petty purposes
dictated only by the narrow range of our unilluminated intellect.
Therefore the ancient wisdom says, "With all thy getting, get
understanding."

The awakening to consciousness of our mysterious interior powers will
sooner or later take place, and will result in our using them whether we
understand the law of their development or not, just as we already use
our physical faculties whether we understand their laws or not. The
interior powers are natural powers as much as the exterior ones. We can
direct their use by a knowledge of their laws; and it is therefore of
the highest importance to have some sound principle of guidance in the
use of these higher faculties as they begin to manifest themselves.

If, therefore, we would safely and profitably enter upon the possession
of the great inheritance of power

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

that is opening out before us, we must before all things seek to realise
in ourselves that Superior Intelligence which will become an unfailing
principle of guidance if we will only recognise it as such. Everything
depends on our recognition. Thoughts are things, and therefore as we
*will* our thoughts to be so we *will* the thing to be. If, then, we
will to use the Infinite Spirit as a spirit of guidance, we shall find
that the fact is as we have willed it; and in doing this we are still
making use of our own supreme principle. And this is the true
"understanding" which, by placing all the other powers in their correct
order, creates one grand unity of power directed to clearly defined and
worthy aims, in place of the dispersion of our powers, by which they
only neutralise each other and effect nothing.

This is that Spirit of Truth which shall guide us into all Truth. It is
the sincere Desire of us reaching out after Truth. Truth first and Power
afterwards is the reasonable order, which we cannot invert without
injury to ourselves and others; but if we follow this order we shall
always find scope for our powers in developing into present realities
the continually growing glory of our vision of the ideal.

The ideal is the true real, but it must be brought into manifestation
before it can be shown to be so, and it is in this that the *practical*
nature of our mental studies consists. It is the *practical* mystic who
is the man of power; the man who, realising the mystical powers

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

within, fits his outward action to this knowledge, and so shows his
faith by his works; and assuredly the first step is to make use of that
power of infallible guidance which he can call to his aid simply by
desiring to be led by it.
