### VI

### COMPLETENESS

A POINT on which students of mental science often fail to lay sufficient
stress is the completeness of man--not a completeness to be attained
hereafter, but here and now. We have been so accustomed to have the
imperfection of man drummed into us in books, sermons, and hymns, and
above all in a mistaken interpretation of the Bible, that at first the
idea of his completeness altogether staggers us. Yet until we see this
we must remain shut out from the highest and best that mental science
has to offer, from a thorough understanding of its philosophy, and from
its greatest practical achievements.

To do any work successfully you must believe yourself to be a *whole*
man in respect of it. The completed work is the outward image of a
corresponding completeness in yourself. And if this is true in respect
of one work it is true of all; the difference in the importance of the
work does not matter; we cannot successfully attempt *any* work until,
for some reason or other, we believe ourselves able to accomplish it; in
other words, until we believe that none of the conditions

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

for its completion is wanting in us, and that we are therefore complete
in respect of it. Our recognition of our completeness is thus the
measure of what we are able to do, and hence the great importance of
knowing the fact of our own completeness.

But, it may be asked, do we not see imperfection all around? Is there
not sorrow, sickness, and trouble? Yes; but why? Just for the very
reason that we do not realise our completeness. If we realised *that* in
its fulness these things would not be; and in the degree in which we
come to realise it we shall find them steadily diminish. Now if we
really grasp the two fundamental truths that Spirit is Life pure and
simple, and that external things are the result of interior forces, then
it ought not to be difficult to see why we should be complete; for to
suppose otherwise is to suppose the reactive power of the universe to be
either unable or unwilling to produce the complete expression of its own
intention in the creation of man.

That it should be unable to do so would be to depose it from its place
as the creative principle, and that it should be unwilling to fulfil its
own intention is a contradiction in terms; so that on either supposition
we come to a *reductio ad absurdum*. In forming man the creative
principle therefore *must* have produced a perfect work, and our
conception of ourselves as imperfect can only be the result of our own
ignorance of what we really are; and our advance, therefore, does not
consist in having something new added to us, but

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

in learning to bring into action powers which already exist in us, but
which we have never tried to use, and therefore have not developed,
simply because we have always taken it for granted that we are by nature
defective in some of the most important faculties necessary to fit us to
our environment.

If we wish to attain to these great powers, the question is, where are
we to seek them? And the answer is *in ourselves*. That is the great
secret. We are not to go outside ourselves to look for power. As soon as
we do so we find, not power, but weakness. To seek strength from any
outside source is to make affirmation of our weakness, and all know what
the natural result of such an affirmation must be.

We are complete *in ourselves*; and the reason why we fail to realise
this is that we do not understand how far the "self" of ourselves
extends. We know that the whole of anything consists of *all* its parts
and not only of some of them; yet this is just what we do not seem to
know about ourselves. We say rightly that every person is a
concentration of the Universal Spirit into individual consciousness; but
if so, then each individual consciousness must find the Universal Spirit
to be the infinite expression of *itself*. It is *this* part of the
"Self" that we so often leave out in our estimate of what we are; and
consequently we look upon ourselves as crawling pygmies when we might
think of ourselves as archangels. We try to work with the mere shadows
of ourselves instead of with the glorious

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

substance, and then wonder at our failures. If we only understood that
our "better half" is the whole infinite of Spirit--that which creates
and sustains the universe--then we should know how complete our
completeness is.

As we approach this conception, our completeness becomes a reality to
us, and we find that we need not go outside ourselves for anything. We
have only to draw on that part of ourselves which is infinite to carry
out any intention we may form in our individual consciousness; for there
is no barrier between the two parts, otherwise they would not be a
whole. Each belongs perfectly to the other, and the two are one. There
is no antagonism between them, for the Infinite Life can have no
interest against its individualisation of *itself*. If there is any
feeling of tension it proceeds from our not fully realising this
conception of our own wholeness; we are placing a barrier somewhere,
when in truth there is none; and the tension will continue until we find
out where and how we are setting up this barrier and remove it.

This feeling of tension is the feeling that we are *not using our Whole
Being*. We are trying to make half do the work of the whole; but we
cannot rid ourselves of our wholeness, and therefore the whole protests
against our attempts to set one half against the other. But when we
realise that our concentration *out of* the Infinite also implies our
expansion *into* it, we shall see that our *whole* "self" includes both
the

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

concentration and the expansion; and seeing this first intellectually we
shall gradually learn to use our knowledge practically and bring our
whole man to bear upon whatever we take in hand. We shall find that
there is in us a constant action and reaction between the infinite and
the individual, like the circulation of the blood from the heart to the
extremities and back again, a constant pulsation of vital energy quite
natural and free from all strain and exertion.

This is the great secret of the livingness of Life, and it is called by
many names and set forth under many symbols in various religions and
philosophies, each of which has its value in proportion as it brings us
nearer the realisation of this perfect wholeness. But the thing itself
is Life, and therefore can only be suggested, but not described, by any
words or symbols; it is a matter of personal experience which no one can
convey to another. All we can do is to point out the direction in which
this experience is to be sought, and to tell others the intellectual
arguments which have helped us to find it; but the experience itself is
the operation of definite vital functions of the inner being, and no one
but ourselves can do our living for us.

But, so far as it is possible to express these things in words, what
must be the result of realising that the "self" in us includes the
Infinite as well as the Individual? All the resources of the Infinite
must be at our disposal; we may draw on them as we will, and there is no
limit save that imposed by the Law of

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kindness, a
self-imposed limitation, which, because of being *self*-imposed, is not
bondage but only another expression of our liberty. Thus we are free and
all limitations are removed.

We are also no longer ignorant, for since the "self" in us includes the
Infinite we can draw thence all needed knowledge, and though we may not
always be able to formulate this knowledge in the mentality, we shall
*feel* its guidance, and eventually the mentality will learn to put this
also into form of words; and thus by combining thought and experience,
theory and practice, we shall by degrees come more and more into the
knowledge of the Law of our Being, and find that there is no place in it
for fear, because it is the law of perfect liberty. And knowing what our
whole self really is, we shall walk erect as free men and women
radiating Light and Life all round, so that our very presence will carry
a vivifying influence with it, because we realise ourselves to be an
Affirmative Whole, and not a mere negative disintegration of parts.

We know that our whole self includes that Greater Man which is back of
and causes the phenomenal man, and this Greater Man is the true human
principle in us. It is, therefore, universal in its sympathies, but at
the same time not less individually *ourself*; and thus the true man in
us, being at once both universal and individual, can be trusted as a
sure guide. It is that "Thinker" which is behind the conscious
mentality,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

and which, if we will accept it as our centre, and realise that it is
not a separate entity but *ourself*, will be found equal to every
occasion, and will lead us out of a condition of servitude into "the
glorious liberty of the sons of God."
