### IV

### AFFIRMATIVE POWER

THOROUGHLY to realise the true nature of affirmative power is to possess
the key to the great secret. We feel its presence in all the innumerable
forms of life by which we are surrounded and we feel it as the life in
ourselves; and at last some day the truth bursts upon us like a
revelation that we can wield this power, this life, by the process of
Thought. And as soon as we see this, the importance of regulating our
thinking begins to dawn upon us. We ask ourselves what this thought
process is, and we then find that it is thinking affirmative force into
forms which are the product of our own thought. We mentally conceive the
form and then think life into it.

This must always be the nature of the creative process on whatever
scale, whether on the grand scale of the Universal Cosmic Mind or on the
miniature scale of the individual mind; the difference is only in degree
and not in kind. We may picture the mental machinery by which this is
done in the way that best satisfies our intellect--and the satisfying of
the intellect on this point is a potent factor in giving us that

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

confidence in our mental action without which we can effect nothing--but
the actual externalisation is the result of something more powerful than
a merely intellectual apprehension. It is the result of that inner
mental state which, for want of a better word, we may call our emotional
conception of ourselves. It is the "self" which we *feel* ourselves to
be which takes forms of our own creating. For this reason our thought
must be so grounded upon knowledge that we shall feel
[the](errata.htm#0.md) truth of it, and thus be able to produce in
ourselves that mental attitude of feeling which corresponds to the
condition which we desire to externalise.

We cannot think into manifestation a different sort of life to that
which we realise in ourselves. As Horace says, "*Nemo dat quod non
habet*," we cannot give what we have not got. And, on the other hand, we
can never cease creating forms of some sort by our mental activity,
thinking life into them. This point must be very carefully noted. We
cannot sit still producing nothing: the mental machinery *will* keep on
turning out work of some sort, and it rests with us to determine of what
sort it shall be. In our entire ignorance or imperfect realisation of
this we create negative forms and think life into them. We create forms
of death, sickness, sorrow, trouble, and limitation of all sorts, and
then think life into these forms; with the result that, however
non-existent in themselves, to us they become realities and throw their
shadow across the path which would otherwise be

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

bright with the many-coloured beauties of innumerable flowers and the
glory of the sunshine.

This need not be. It is giving to the negative an affirmative force
which does not belong to it. Consider what is meant by the negative. It
is the absence of something. It is not-being, and is the absence of all
that constitutes being. Left to itself, it remains in its own
nothingness, and it only assumes form and activity when we give these to
it by our thought.

Here, then, is the great reason for practising control over our thought.
It is the one and only instrument we have to work with, but it is an
instrument which works with the greatest certainty, for limitation if we
think limitation, for enlargement if we think enlargement. Our thought
as feeling is the magnet which draws to us those conditions which
accurately correspond to itself. This is the meaning of the saying that
"thoughts are things." But, you say, how can I think differently from
the circumstances? Certainly you are not required to say that the
circumstances *at the present moment* are what they are not; to say so
would be untrue; but what is wanted is not to think from the standpoint
of circumstances at all. Think from that interior standpoint where there
are no circumstances, and from whence you can dictate what circumstances
shall be, and then leave the circumstances to take care of themselves.

Do not think of this, that, or the other particular *circumstances* of
health, peace, etc., but of health, peace,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

and prosperity themselves. Here is an advertisement from *Pearson's
Weekly*:--"Think money. Big money-makers *think* money." This is a
perfectly sound statement of the power of thought, although it is only
an advertisement; but we may make an advance beyond thinking "money." We
can think "Life" in all its fulness, together with that perfect harmony
of conditions which includes all that we need of money and a thousand
other good things besides, for some of which money stands as the symbol
of exchangeable value, while others cannot be estimated by so material a
standard.

Therefore think Life, illumination, harmony, prosperity,
happiness--think the things rather than this or that condition of them.
And then by the sure operation of the Universal Law these things will
form themselves into the shapes best suited to your particular case, and
will enter your life as active, living forces, which will never depart
from you because you know them to be part and parcel of your own being.
