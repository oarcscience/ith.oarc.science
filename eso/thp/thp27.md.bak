### FRAGMENTS

I. God is Love.

Man, having the understanding of God, speaks the Word of Power.

2\. Man gives utterance to God.

3\. The Father is Equilibrium.

The Son is Concentration of the same Spirit. The Spirit is Projection.

*The Tri-une Relation*--always consists of these Three:

\(I\) The Potential--(II) The Ideal--(III) The Concrete.

\(I\) The Potential is Life in its most highly abstract mode not yet
brought into Form even as Thought. Not particularised in any way.

\(II\) The Ideal is the particularising of the Potential into a certain
Formulated Thought.

\(III\) The Concrete is the Manifestation of the Formulated Thought in
Visible Form.

What everybody wants is to become *more alive*--as Jesus said, "I am
come that they might have Life and might have it more abundantly"--and
it is only

on the basis of realising ourselves as a *perfect unity throughout*, not
made up of opposing parts, and that unity *Spirit*, that we can realise
in ourselves the *Livingness* which *Spirit is*, and which we *as
Spirit* ought to be.

HENCE PERFECT DEMONSTRATION.

"The Truth shall make you Free"

| Life    | :             |
| Love    | : = The Truth |
| Liberty | :             |

The Ultimate Truth will always be found to consist of these three, and
anything that is contrary to them is contrary to Fundamental Truth.

WORSHIP

Worship consists in the recognition of the *Personal* Nature of Holy
Spirit, and in the Continual Alternation (Pulsation) between the two
positions of "I am the Person that Thou art," and "Thou art the Person
that I am." The Two Personalities are One.
