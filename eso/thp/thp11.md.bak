### IX

### TOUCHING LIGHTLY

WHAT is our point of support? Is it in ourselves or outside us? Are we
self-poised, or does our balance depend on something external? According
to the actual belief in which our answer to these questions is embodied
so will our lives be. In everything there are two parts, the essential
and the incidental--that which is the nucleus and *raison d’être* of the
whole thing, and that which gathers round this nucleus and takes form
from it. The true knowledge always consists in distinguishing these two
from each other, and error always consists in misplacing them.

In all our affairs there are two factors, ourselves and the matter to be
dealt with; and since *for us* the nature of anything is always
determined by our thought of it, it is entirely a question of our belief
which of these two factors shall be the essential and which the
accessory. Whichever we regard as the essential, the other at once
becomes the incidental. The incidental can never be absent. For any sort
of action to take place there must be *some* conditions under which the
activity passes out into visible results; but the same sort of activity
may occur under a variety

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

of different conditions, and may thus produce very different visible
results. So in every matter we shall always find an essential or
energising factor, and an incidental factor which derives its quality
from the nature of the energy.

We can therefore never escape from having to select our essential and
our incidental factor, and whichever we select as the essential, we
thereby place the other in the position of the incidental. If, then, we
make the mistake of reversing the true position and suppose that the
energising force comes from the merely accessory circumstances, we make
*them* our point of support and lean upon *them*, and stand or fall with
them accordingly; and so we come into a condition of weakness and
obsequious waiting on all sorts of external influences, which is the
very reverse of that strength, wisdom, and opulence which are the only
meaning of Liberty.

But if we would ask ourselves the common-sense question Where can the
centre of a man's Life be except in himself? we shall see that in all
which pertains to us the energising centre must be in ourselves. We can
never get away from ourselves as the centre of our own universe, and the
sooner we clearly understand this the better. There is really no energy
in *our* universe but what emanates from ourselves in the first
instance, and the power which appears to reside in our surroundings is
derived entirely from our own mind.

If once we realise this, and consider that the Life

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

which flows into us from the Universal Life-Principle is at every moment
*new* Life entirely undifferentiated to any particular purpose besides
that of supporting our own individuality, and that it is therefore ours
to externalise in any form we will, then we find that this manifestation
of the eternal Life-Principle *in ourselves* is the standpoint from
which we can control our surroundings. We must lean firmly on the
central point of our own being and not on anything else. Our mistake is
in taking our surroundings too much "*au grand serieux*." We should
touch things more lightly. As soon as we feel that their weight impedes
our free handling of them they are mastering us, and not we them.

Light handling does not mean weak handling. On the contrary, lightness
of touch is incompatible with a weak grasp of the instrument, which
implies that the weight of the tool is excessive relatively to the force
that seeks to guide it. A light, even playful handling, therefore
implies a firm grasp and perfect control over the instrument. It is only
in the hands of a Grinling Gibbons that the carving tool can create
miracles of aerial lightness from the solid wood. The light yet firm
touch tells not of weakness, but of power held in reserve; and if we
realise our own out-and-out spiritual nature we know that behind any
measure of power we may put forth there is the whole reserve of the
infinite to back us up.

As we come to know this we begin to handle things lightly, playing with
them as a juggler does with his

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

flying knives, which cannot make the slightest movement other than he
has assigned to them, for we begin to see that our control over things
is part of the necessary order of the universe. The disorder we have met
with in the past has resulted precisely from our never having attempted
consciously to introduce this element of our personal control as part of
the system.

Of course, I speak of the *whole* man, and not merely of that part of
him which Walt Whitman says is contained between his hat and his boots.
The *whole* man is an infinitude, and the visible portion of him is the
instrument through which he looks out upon and enjoys all that belongs
to him, his own kingdom of the infinite. And when he learns that this is
the meaning of his conscious individuality, he sees *how* it is that he
is infinite, and finds that he is one with Infinite Mind, which is the
innermost core of the universe. Having thus reached the true centre of
his own being, he can never give this central place to anything else,
but will realise that relatively to this all other things are in the
position of the incidental and accessory, and growing daily in this
knowledge he will learn so to handle all things lightly, yet firmly,
that grief, fear, and error will have less and less space in his world,
until at last sorrow and sighing shall flee away, and everlasting joy
shall take their place. We may have taken only a few steps on the way as
yet, but they are in the right direction, and what we have to do now is
to go on.
