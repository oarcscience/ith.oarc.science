An Exercise in Dream Recall


Purpose: This is an exercise to aid in the recollection of dreams
     through the use of visualization and tactile imagery.  It is best
     performed at the times that one begins to fall asleep.

1.  Relax; take a few deep breaths, and concentrate on the present
    sensation of the extremities.

2.  Allow yourself to feel the gradual decrease in sensitivity of the
    limbs as you drop off to sleep.

3.  Switch your attention rapidly from limb to limb, but block out
    extraneous thoughts as completely as possible.

4.  When nearly all sensation is lost in the extremities, switch your
    attention to the spine; localize your attention to the sensation
    at each vertebra.  Send a current of energy up from the base very
    slowly to the top.

5.  When the current reaches the top, visualize the entire spine as a
    penis, and the point where it enters the skull as the
    sexually-oriented orifice of your choice.

6.  Concentrate now on the sensation of the spine-penis entering the
    foramen magnum-orifice.  When bringing the sensation to the
    concious level, recall that it is your penis and/or your orifice;
    a great deal of sensation is being generated.

7.  Hold the images and sensations in mind until you do, in fact, fall
    asleep. Attempt immediately to hold up your dream-hands in front
    of your eyes.

By practicing this daily, near total dream recall is achieved in a
relatively short time.
 
**********************************************************************
I've sent this out because I've found that better access to one's
dreams often equates to finding a lot of excellent raw material for
personalized magickal work, insofar as many of the archetypes to be
worked with can be found there.  It took about 30 days of work before
I actually got this functioning correctly, but my own dream
recollection is approximately 90% now, and I often remember several
dreams from the same night.  Also, my lucidity is at around 10% of
total.
