# PARADOX V.--REASON IS GOD

THIS should be placed first. It is before everything: it is
self-existent, it exists even for those who do not know it, as the Sun
for the Blind, but to see it, feel it, understand it, this is the
triumph of the understanding in man; it is the definite result of all
the travail of thought and all the aspirations of Faith.

In the principle is Reason, and Reason is in God, and God is
Reason. <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md) All is made by it, and
without

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

it is nothing made. It is the true light that enlightens us from our
birth: it shines even in the darkness, but the darkness does not close
it in.

These words are the oracle of Reason itself, and they occur, as all
know, at the commencement of the Gospel of St. John.

Without this Reason nothing exists; everything has its reason for
existing, even unreason, <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) which
serves as a background to reason as the shadow does to the light.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

The reasonable believer is he who believes in a reason greater than
knowledge; for the reason, or to speak more correctly the reasoning of
each one, is not absolute wisdom.

When I reason ill, I become unreasonable <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md); it is not then reason that I should
distrust, but my own judgment.

I should turn then willingly to those who know more than I do, but even
then I must have reason to believe in their superiority.

To conjecture, at random, what one does not know, and then believe
blindly in one's own conjectures, or in those of others, who know no
more than ourselves, is to behave like madmen. When we are told that God
demands the sacrifice of our reason,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

this is to make God, the ideal or despotic idol, of folly.

Reason gives conviction, but rash belief produces only infatuation.

It is quite reasonable to believe in things that one neither sees,
touches, nor measures, because manifestly the infinite exists, and one
can say not only I believe, but I *know* that an infinity of things
exist which are beyond my reach.

Knowledge being indefinitely progressive, I can believe that I shall one
day know that of which I am now ignorant. I have no doubts in regard to
what I know thoroughly; I may doubt my knowledge if I know imperfectly,
but I cannot have doubts as to a thing of which I know nothing, since it
is impossible for me to formulate them.

*He who says there is no God, without having defined God in a complete
and absolute manner, simply talks nonsense*. I wait for his definition,
and when he has set this forth after his own fashion, I am certain,
beforehand, of being able to say to him, "I agree with you, there *is*
no *such* God"; but that God is certainly not my God. If he says to me:
"Define your God," I should reply, "I will take good care to do nothing
of the kind, for a God defined is a God dethroned." <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) Every positive definition is deniable, the
Infinite is the undefined. "I believe only in matter,"

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

another will tell me, but what *is* matter? In surgery they give that
name to excretions, and one might say in philosophy, somewhat
paradoxically, that matter is the excretion of thought. The materialists
fully deserve to be paid off with this somewhat coarse and Carnivallic
definition, they who declare thought the excretion of the material
brain, without realising that this admirable and passive instrument of
the workings of the human soul is the masterpiece of a thought, which is
not ours.

If I could define God, in a certain and positive manner, I should cease
to *believe* in God, I should *know* what he is, but not being able to
*know* this, I simply believe that he exists, *because it is impossible
for me not to conceive a directive thought, in this eternally living
substance that peoples infinite space*. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

If believers in exclusive Religions tell me that God has revealed
himself and that he has spoken, I reply I do not *believe* it, I *know*
it. I know that God reveals himself to the human heart in the beauties
of Nature; I know that he has spoken by the voices of all the wise and
in the hearts of all the just. I read his words, in the hymns of
Cleanthus and Orpheus, as in the Psalms of David; I admire the grand
pages of the Vedas and of the Koran, and find the legend of Krishna as
touching as a gospel, but I wax wroth against Jupiter torturing
Prometheus and serving as a pretext for the death of Socrates. I shudder
when

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I hear the Christ reproaching, in his last dying
sobs, Jehovah for having abandoned him, and I veil my face when
Alexander VI professes to represent Jesus Christ. The executioners and
tormentors of the human conscience are as odious to me under the
priestly reign of Pius VI as under that of Nero. The *true Christian
Religion is humanity, superhuman in the strength of forgiveness, and the
sacrifice of self for others*.

The Gods to whom are sacrificed men are Demons. Reason should for ever
thrust away the worship of these Demons, and the idol of the Devil,
which has become ridiculous by it, is monstrosity. *Those who believe in
the Devil, worship the Devil, for they worship his Creator and . . .
accomplice*. We have already said, *The God of the Devil, who reproves
the Devil and yet still allows hint to work on for our destruction is a
horrible fiction of human wickedness and cowardice*; a God of the Devil
turned round would become a Devil of a God. Thus speaks reason, but
superstition would still impose silence, and that is why many people,
excusably enough, leave, while pitying them, to the superstitious their
God and their Devil, and themselves believe thenceforth in nothing.

But even superstition has its *raison d'être* in the infinities of the
human intellect. The Priesthood has succeeded in converting it into a
force, by subjecting it to blind obedience. Take away superstition from
souls, narrow but ardent, and you convert them into fanatics of impiety.
One must e'en restrain fools

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

through their folly <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md), since they are
not *willing* to be wise.

We teach morality to children by telling them stories, and the nurses
take good care not to disabuse their minds when they are frightened at
Bogy. It is true that certain realistic mothers threaten their children
with the wolf or the policeman, but neither wolf nor policeman can be
everywhere, and the child, convinced of their absence, will laugh at the
threat, whereas Bogy, who is never seen anywhere, is believed, like the
Devil, to be present everywhere, and. the child is all the more impelled
to believe in it because it is a fiction, a poetic delusion, a story-in
one word something that takes hold on the imagination, and the
imagination, powerful in men, is supreme in children.

Bogy is the children's Devil, just as the Devil of the Middle Ages was
the Bogy of men.

Moreover there is no fiction which does not serve as a veil or mask for
some reality. Bogy exists, and the poor child will soon know him in the
guise of a frowning pedant with harsh voice and more or less justly
applied cane.

Then they will tell him about God and the Devil in such terms that he
might easily mistake one for the other. Will he then continue satisfied
with the

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

conclusion of the drama of Punch? Punch made him laugh, the Devil wanted
to make him cry; would he not wish that in the end, Punch, so often
carried off by the Devil, should in his turn carry off the Devil? This
would be a question of temperament and audacity.

Ancient Hierophants have always held that it would be the greatest crime
to admit the multitude to the initiations because it would be to let
loose the wolves, open the paddock of the fallow deer, and plunge all
men in war one with the other under the pretext of equality.

Jesus Christ enjoined upon his disciples not to cast their pearls before
swine. The Freemasons to this day swear to preserve to the death the
secrets which they no longer possess. Equality amongst men can only
exist by Hierarchical grades; it can never be absolute, because Nature
disallows it. There must be great and little, so that men may mutually
assist, and have need of, each other.

Nothing is more difficult for the common run of men than to live
according to reason, and do good for the sake of good. Their motive is
almost always desire or fear, and they are to be led by hope or dread.
They require, moreover, restraint to prevent their falling into inertia
or disorder. They march better when in regiments and loaded; the monk
and the soldier rejoice under an iron discipline; it is by austerities
and silence that the inconstancy of woman disappears. One man lives
courageously the life of a Trappist who would be a robber, did he not
long for

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Heaven and fear Hell. Is he the better for this?
Perhaps not, but certainly it is less dangerous for Society.

It is all very fine to tell the truth to men, but they will not
understand it unless they have already themselves sought for and almost
found it. The world of Tiberius wanted expiations and austerities. The
age of the Platonists and Stoics, of Seneca and Epictetus, was bound to
embrace the Christian Morality. Virgil seems to sing near to the manger
of the Man-God, and the Sibylline books promised the Christ to earth!

Luther was not carried by his *own* impulse against Rome; he was lifted
and pushed forward by a current that swept over all Europe. Voltaire did
not make the eighteenth century, it was the eighteenth century which
made Voltaire. The reign of Madame de Maintenon and the scandals of
Jansenism had disgusted and wearied France to the last degree; the
funereal orisons of Bossuet seemed to have interred the Christian
Monarchy, and there followed Cardinals like Bernel and like Dubois.
Voltaire scoffed at everything and made people laugh. Rousseau, however,
professed that there was something in it, and people admired while
persecuting him, because in their hearts the world was somewhat of his
way of thinking. The revolutionists out-Rousseau'd Rousseau, and the
good sense of the country sided with Chateaubriand, though all the while
applauding the Voltairian rogueries of Béranger: it is progress that
brings great men to the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

front, and the world wrongly credits them with the movement which has
made them conspicuous.

The French Revolution presented a strange and ridiculous spectacle to
the world, when it inaugurated the worship of Reason, personified by an
opera dancer. One might have fancied that the nation was making fun of
itself, and desired to avow to other nations that the reason of the
French is almost always folly.

Then it was that Robespierre, to dethrone this indecent Reason, invented
his Supreme Being, but public opinion would not ratify the change; it
remembered God and realised that the Revolution was shifting its ground.
Bonaparte, who followed, understood that Religion was not dead, but
Religion for him could only be Catholic, in other words, authoritative;
he re-opened the Churches, and tried to lay his hand on the Pope, but
the Pope slipped from him with the world.

It is that the reason of Religion is superior to the reason of Politics,
because it is only in Religion that right takes the lead of might. For a
right to be inviolable it must be proclaimed as Divine. Right and Duty
are above man, God preserves the one, in imposing the other on him; God
is the Supreme Reason.

A body cannot live without a head, and the head of the social body is
God. A body changes but does not die, if its head be immortal. God is
the Truth and justice that never change; it is for this cause that the
state should give way to religious reasons. The

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Church is the prototype of the Fatherland; it is
the Universal Fatherland, and the unity of the Christian world <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) is something greater than the unity of
Germany or Italy.

Moral force is superior to physical force, and spiritual power gets the
upper hand of temporal power. If St. Peter had never drawn his sword,
Jesus would never have said to him, "When thou shalt be old, thou shalt
stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee
whither thou wouldest not." The King of Italy has taken Rome from the
Holy Father, because St. Peter took by force the ear of Malchus. Malchus
or Male signifies, in Hebrew, the king. Be it as it may, the capital of
the Christian world ought not to belong exclusively to Italy. The
supreme representative of Divine Humanity ought to be a priest to bless
and a king to pardon. That is what reason tells us, and if the Pope
*believes* that a father of a family ought to be infallible for his
children, that the head of religion ought to have no dealings with
irreligion; that liberty of conscience ought not to be permitted; if he
*believes* himself obliged to turn society upside down; if he protests,
in a word, against each and everything that appears to him contrary to
dogma, why, setting aside the justice of the question, the Pope is a
thousand times right! <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

Next to the passions, the greatest enemies of human reason are the
prejudices. We do not examine how things are; we simply will that they
should be in such and such a way. We refuse to change our opinion,
because this humiliates our pride, as if man was born infallible, and
should not day by day instruct and perfect himself. "When I was a
child," said St. Paul, "I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish
things." The apostle here proclaims the law of progress and even applies
it to the Church, but this is what the theologians obstinately refuse to
understand.

We must distrust devout prejudices as much as impious prejudices. True
piety is essentially independent, but she submits herself reasonably to
customs and laws, when she cannot hope, and even often when she does
hope, to change them.

Jesus would not that they should pluck up the tares which were mixed
with the wheat, for fear lest at the same time they should uproot the
good grain; but that they should wait for the harvest, and then separate
the wheat from the evil weeds. There are epochs of summing up and
synthesis, in which criticism ought to distinguish the true from the
false. We are at one of such epochs in which prejudices ought

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

no longer to be tenderly handled. Nevertheless, we must not be harsh
with the people who hold them. Let us show, softly and patiently, the
truth, and the falsehoods will fall of their own accord. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md)

Prejudices are the bad habits of the mind; they spring from education,
from ignorance or intellectual sloth, from interests of position,
reputation or fortune. We readily believe in the truth of what pleases
us and still more readily in what flatters us; the best feelings, even
when exaggerated, become sources of prejudice; the love of family
produces pride and the intolerance of caste; the love of country gives
place to national arrogance; people think that they should be French, or
English, rather than that they should be *men*: religious enthusiasm
leads on to many other excesses. Succeeding ages despise, condemn and
execrate each other; the Christians are dogs for the followers of
Muhammad, the Jews are obscene beings for the Christian, the Protestants
are Heretics, the Catholics are Papists . . . where are the reasonable
men?

Reason is like Truth; she shocks when seen naked.

To be too much in the right is to be in the wrong. Reason should
persuade and not impose herself. She has little power over children, and
almost always displeases women.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

She is a power, but it is an occult power; she should govern without
showing her hand. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)

It requires a very powerful and firm mind to devote oneself without
danger to the occult sciences, and above all to the experiences which
confirm their theories; magnetism, divination and spiritualism still
people the madhouses, and the Hermetic Philosophy may add further
victims. The most celebrated proficients in these sciences have had
their moments of aberration. Pythagoras remembered to have been
Euphorbius. Apollonius of Tyana caused an old beggar to be stoned to
stay the Plague. Paracelsus believed that he had a familiar spirit
hidden in the pommel of his long sword. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) Cardan allowed himself to die of hunger to
justify astrology. Duchenteau, who reconstructed and completed the magic
calendar of Tycho-Brahe, also died miserably in attempting an
extravagant experiment. Cagliostro compromised himself with a set of
rogues, in the matter of the Queen's necklace, and went away to die in
the dungeons of Rome. The interior of the ark is not to be looked at
with impunity, and those who will touch it run the risk of being struck
like Moza by lightning.

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I *do not speak of the fear, the envy, the hate
of the vulgar which everywhere pursue the Initiate, who does not know
how to conceal his knowledge. True sages escape from this danger*. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md) The Abbé Trithemus lived and died
peacefully while Agrippa, his imprudent disciple, closed prematurely in
a hospital a life of disquietude and torment. Agrippa, before his death,
blasphemed against the Science, as Brutus at Philippi had blasphemed
against Virtue, but despite the despair of Brutus, Virtue is more than
an empty name, and despite the discouragement of Agrippa, Science <span
id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58.md) is a Truth.

At the present day, occult sciences are scarcely studied except by
presumptuous ignoramuses or eccentric savants; women furnish their
necessary ground, in hysterical crisps and doubtful somnambulism. People
want above all things prodigies; to cog the dice of Fortune, to shuffle
the cards of Fate, to have philtres and amulets, to bewitch their
enemies, to put jealous husbands to sleep, to discover the universal
panacea of all the vices, not to reform them, but to preserve them from
the two great diseases that kill them--deception and
lassitude--countenance such schemes, and one is sure to travel quickly
on the high road of folly. If the hasty Achilles of Homer had been
wholly invulnerable, he would only have been a

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

cowardly assassin, and the man who was sure of always gaining at play
would soon ruin every one, and ought to be branded as a swindler. *He
who by a single act of his Will could entail on others sickness or
death, would be a public Pest, of whom Society ought to rid itself; to
win love, save by natural means, is to commit a sort of violation; to
evoke shades is to call down upon oneself the Eternal Shadows*. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) To deal with demons one must be a demon.
The Devil is the spirit of Evil, the fatal current of misdirected and
evil wills. To enter this current is to plunge into the abyss. Moreover
the Spirit of Evil only replies to rash and unhealthy curiosity. Visions
are the phenomena of drunkenness or delirium. To see spirits? What a
chimera! It is as though one professed to touch music and bottle
thought. If the spirits of the dead have gone out from amongst us, it is
because they could no longer live here. How do you suppose they are to
come back? <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md)

But then it will be said, what can be the use of magic? It enables men
to understand better the Truth, and desire Good in a healthier and more
effective manner. It helps to heal souls and comfort bodies. It does not
confer the means of doing evil with impunity, but it raises man above
animal lusts. It renders man inaccessible to the agonies of desire and
fear. It constitutes a divinely radiating centre,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

chasing away before it phantoms and darkness, for *it knows, it wills,
it* CAN, and *it holds its peace*. This is the true magic, not that of
the Necromancers and Enchanters, but that of the initiated and the Magi.

*True magic is a scientific force placed at the service of Reason. False
magic is a blind force added to the blunders and disorders of
Folly*. <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[57:2](phs08.htm#fr_46.md) Our version reads In the
beginning was the Word," etc., but neither reading adequately conveys
the occult sense of the passage. The *arche* is the primordial evolute,
which the ONE unconsciously emanates, the beginning of all things. The
*logos* is the Law of Evolution, the reason of all things, itself the
cause of their complex inter- relations, the Word, <span id="page_58">p.
58</span> the Force or Energy that everywhere and in all time,
regulates, and *is*, at the same time, the mainspring of the
universe.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[58:1](phs08.htm#fr_47.md) This is an instance of
Éliphas Lévi's persistent habit of at one time using words in their
occult senses, and at another, perhaps in the same sentence, in their
popular senses, so as to lead the unwary to the conclusion that he is
using them throughout in these latter. Of course there is no *alogos*,
*no* such thing as "*déraison*," if *raison* is to be construed in its
occult sense. All through his writings he grasps at any apparently neat
antithesis, no matter how false it may be, or how much he thereby risks
misleading the most worthy student as to his real meaning. Unreason
acting as a background to show up reason is nonsense, if reason be taken
in its occult sense in which he has been using it in the previous lines,
viz., of the force or law or impulse or design, or all put together,
without which nothing can have come into being, and which accounts for
all that exists, because Unreason has no occult sense, and in its
popular sense is as much an evolute of the logos, as is Reason, in the
ordinary signification of the word; but E. L. <span id="page_59">p.
59</span> could not resist the jingle of Reason and Unreason, and so
without warning in the middle of the sentence he uses "Reason," for the
first time in the discourse, in its restricted exoteric meaning.
Moreover having laid down some law or truth in words bearing, and
intended by him to bear, some broad occult sense, he constantly goes on
to argue on or *play* with these in their restricted commonplace
significations, introducing thus a confusion of ideas, utterly
bewildering to the reader, even if the writer did not, as I suspect,
frequently himself lose touch with the Higher Doctrine. If these
weaknesses of our author be kept in mind, many apparent difficulties in
all his works will disappear.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[59:1](phs08.htm#fr_48.md) The original is, *Quand
je raisonne mal, je n'ai point raison*, a play on words which can only
be approximated in English as above.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[60:1](phs08.htm#fr_49.md) The original play upon
the words, "*un Dieu défini est un Dieu fini*" cannot be exactly
reproduced in English.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[61:1](phs08.htm#fr_50.md) Within that Substance,
within every atom of it, but not outside of it. There is no extra-cosmic
Deity. *All* matter is God, and God is Matter, or there is no God,--E.
O.

This seems to me begging the question. Has any one been outside the
Cosmos to look? E. O. may reply Cosmos is infinite, there can be nothing
*outside* what is infinite, forgetting, it seems tome, that what may be
infinite to all conditioned in it, may yet leave room for a beyond to
the Unconditioned. He admits a fourth dimension of space, and asserts
further on, as will be seen, and as I believe with good reason, that
there are yet fifth, sixth and seventh dimensions of space to be
discovered, yet he desires to insist that the conceptions of
intelligences (I give him in the planetary spirits and all) conditioned
in <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> the Cosmos, which *we* can only think
of as infinite, are absolute; whereas I submit, that they are
necessarily relative, and that the fact that the highest intelligences
conditioned in the universe *believe* it to be infinite and can trace in
it nothing but laws, by no means *proves* that to a still higher and
unconditioned intelligence there *may* not be something outside that
infinity, and in that something the intelligence whose will the
discoverable Laws represent. Nay, further, I submit that intelligence
may be inside and pervading the Cosmos, and yet be incognisable for its
own good reasons by all its emanated intelligences. To me therefore: the
assertion that either "God is matter" (in the sense of unconscious
unintelligent substance) "or there is no God," appears equally rash and
unphilosophical. I fully understand the refusal to acknowledge or
believe in that, of which no knowledge exists, and of which no evidence
can be obtained, but this seems to me wholly different from denying its
existence, which involves the assumption of omniscience. --*Trans*.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[64:1](phs08.htm#fr_51.md) And I must say he puts
this precept into practice admirably; while laughing at the fools with
one corner of the mouth, he strengthens their folly with the other.--E.
O.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[68:1](phs08.htm#fr_52.md) But when or where has
such Unity ever existed?--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[68:2](phs08.htm#fr_53.md) it is scarcely necessary
to tell most readers that all this is elaborate chaff. Still our
author's <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> persistent habit of saying,
apparently seriously, what he does not believe and what he does not mean
any one but "*les fous*" to believe, is likely too often to become
seriously misleading to this latter large and respectable
class.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[70:1](phs08.htm#fr_54.md) This is true, but only
half the Truth. Per contra remember that the longer you let the weeds
stand, the wider will their seeds be disseminated, and the larger and
stubborner the growth you will have to deal with.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[71:1](phs08.htm#fr_55.md) He seems to draw but a
feeble line between "the Occult" and "the Jesuitical".--E. O.

Doubtless because he himself, like many other occultists, was avowedly
somewhat Jesuitical in his dealings with non-initiates.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[71:2](phs08.htm#fr_56.md) Éliphas, as usual, is
here poking fun at his *Public*. He is perfectly aware that all these
pretended traits of madness have an occult signification.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[72:1](phs08.htm#fr_57.md) I am glad he admits the
principle.--E. O.

The principle "*de dissimuler*"? I fear it is a principle all are only
too ready to admit.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[72:2](phs08.htm#fr_58.md) He means here of course
*Occult* Science.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[73:1](phs08.htm#fr_59.md) Very right.--E. O.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[73:2](phs08.htm#fr_60.md) All this is true, in one
sense, but, as E. L. well knew, it is not the whole truth.--*Trans*.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[74:1](phs08.htm#fr_61.md) Darkness, *bad* or evil,
as given in the Codex Nazaræus, are merely a gradual waning of the
Pleroma or akasic light. (*Caligo ubi exstiterat etiam exstitisse
decrementum et detrimentum*.) The Sorcerer uses the grosser, the
*physically* more potential principles of akasa. The Pleroma of the
Greek authors of Christianity is our akasa. "Air, the ether, is the
Pleroma, the space held from Eternity by the ONE existence."
(Onomasticon, 13) "*To Pan Pleroma tōn aionōn--universum pleroma
aconum*." (Irenaeus, I, i., p. 15.) "In him dwells all the Pleroma
carnally." (Engl. vers.) "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the
Godhead bodily."--(Coloss., 2, 9.) E. O.
