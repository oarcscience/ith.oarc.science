# FOREWORD To the 1922 Second Edition

THERE appear, in the early volumes of *The Theosophist*, several
fragments called "Unpublished Writings of Éliphas Lévi." "Éliphas Lévi"
was the French Abbé Louis Constant, a priest who left the Roman Catholic
Church to devote himself to Kabbalistic Mysticism. One of these
"unpublished writings"--which however was not printed in *The
Theosophist*, but separately as a pamphlet, in the series "Theosophical
Miscellanies"--was commented upon in footnotes by "E. O.", "Eminent
Occultist." Éliphas Lévi's essay, together with E. O.'s footnotes, was
then published, and the present publication is a reprint of this
"Theosophical Miscellany" printed in Calcutta in 1883.

There would be no point in reprinting this old "propaganda literature"
of the early days of the Theosophical Society, but for the fact that
"Eminent Occultist" is the Master of the Wisdom now well known among
Theosophists under the initials "K. H." It is in a footnote of the
Master, in 1883, that first appears in Theosophical literature the
assertion that Jesus Christ lived a century B. C. Surely nothing could
be more beautiful about woman's rôle in life than what He says in the
last of His footnotes.

Reading these notes of the Master has inspired me and given me an
insight into His mind. I have urged their republication, hoping that
others may receive from them what I have received.

C.J.
