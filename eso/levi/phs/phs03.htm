<p>THERE appear, in the early volumes of <i>The Theosophist</i>, several fragments called "Unpublished Writings of &Eacute;liphas L&eacute;vi." "&Eacute;liphas L&eacute;vi" was the French Abb&eacute; Louis Constant, a priest who left the Roman Catholic Church to devote himself to Kabbalistic Mysticism. One of these "unpublished writings"--which however was not printed in <i>The Theosophist</i>, but separately as a pamphlet, in the series "Theosophical Miscellanies"--was commented upon in footnotes by "E. O.", "Eminent Occultist." &Eacute;liphas L&eacute;vi's essay, together with E. O.'s footnotes, was then published, and the present publication is a reprint of this "Theosophical Miscellany" printed in Calcutta in 1883.</p>  
<p>There would be no point in reprinting this old "propaganda literature" of the early days of the Theosophical Society, but for the fact that "Eminent Occultist" is the Master of the Wisdom now well known among Theosophists under the initials "K. H." It is in a footnote of the Master, in 1883, that first appears in Theosophical literature the assertion that Jesus Christ lived a century B. C. Surely nothing could be more beautiful about woman's r&ocirc;le in life than what He says in the last of His footnotes.</p>  
<p>Reading these notes of the Master has inspired me and given me an insight into His mind. I have urged their republication, hoping that others may receive from them what I have received.</p>
