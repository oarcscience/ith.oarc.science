This was the first of Lévi's books to be translated into English. The
original French version was published in 1856. This translation (by an
unknown hand) was first published in 1883 by the Theosophical Society,
and re-issued in 1922, with additional extensive footnotes by 'an
Eminent Occultist' (herein, E.O.). The identity of E.O. is unknown, but
it is believed from the style and views expressed that it was none other
than Helena P. Blavatsky.
