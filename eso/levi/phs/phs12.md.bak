# The Great Secret

NOT to succumb to the unchangeable forces of nature, but to direct them;
not to allow ourselves to be enslaved by them, but to make use of them
to the benefit of immortal liberty; *this* is the great Secret of Magic.

Nature is intelligent, but she is not free. The Heavenly bodies have
instinctive souls like animals, and impregnate each other; the planets
are the seraglio of the sun, and the suns are the docile flock of God.

The earth has a soul which obeys the sun, under the decrees of Fate, and
obeys man, instinctively.

*But, for man to command the soul of the earth demands great knowledge
and great wisdom*, or great exaltation. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)

Folly has its prodigies, and these more abundantly than wisdom, because
wisdom does not seek prodigies, but tends naturally towards preventing
their occurrence. It is said that the Devil performs miracles,

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

and there is hardly any one but him who *does* perform them, in the
sense which the ignorant masses attribute to the word. Everything that
tends to estrange man from Science and Reason is assuredly the work of
an evil Principle.

The sun has intelligence, but the earth is mindless; <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) without the Sun and the labour of man
she would produce nothing. The sun is her impregnator and man her
accoucheur, and reluctantly and with a bad grace does she yield to the
caresses of her spouse and the attendance of her physician. Animals,
ill-organised ferocious beasts, noxious insects, parasitical and
poisonous plants, abortions, monsters and plagues, are the fruits of her
clumsiness. She resists as much as she can, and her resistance is not a
crime; she is but the creature of Law, and serves as a counterpoise to
the activity of the sun. According to the hieratic tradition, man, the
only son of God, ought to command the earth, but man, having infringed
the law of God, has ceased to be free, and slaves are equals before
slavery. The soul of the earth <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) is
hostile to man, because she feels that he has no longer the right to
command her; she resists him and deceives him; it is she who produces
dreams, nightmares, visions and hallucinations, favoured in this by
fanaticism,

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

drunkenness, debauchery and all nervous disorders; madmen, hysterical
women, cataleptics and somnambulists are all under her direct influence.
They call her also the astral light, and it is she who produces all the
phantasmagoria of spiritualism.

We admit that the name astral light does not perfectly apply to the soul
of the earth. This instinctive power of our planet manifests itself by
negative electricity and magnetism; positive electricity, heat and light
come from the influence of the sun.

The soul of the earth radiates out specially during the night. The light
restrains and repels its effluvia. It is at midnight, especially in the
middle of the long nights of winter, that phantoms love to appear. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md)

A man is not a saint because he has visions, but one may have visions
and yet be a saint, and even amongst the saints visions always involve
something ridiculous or hideous. St. Teresa was tormented by blood, and
believed she saw living walls, which were choking, and a Cherub armed
with an arrow to lance them. Marie Alacoque saw Jesus Christ open his
chest and exhibit his heart palpitating and bleeding. Martin de
Gallardon saw an angel dressed as a footman; the children of Sallette
adorned the Virgin with a huge peasant's bonnet, with a yellow apron,
and with roses stuck on to her feet. Bernadette Soubirons sees our Lady
of Lourdes, dressed like a girl, about to take the sacrament, with a
little blue

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

apron and yellow roses planted by the stalks in her naked feet.
Berbignier saw Jesus Christ in the midst of several flat candlestick
sockets. This vision of candle-stick sockets reappears at Pontmain,
where four candles are seen fixed to the wall of the heavens and the
good Virgin in the middle of them. Ravaillac saw the sacred wafers
fluttering around his head and heard a voice which told him to kill
Henry the IV. <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md) The instinctive soul
of the Earth eagerly demands blood, and favours the exaltations which
lead to its shedding. Spectres, like crows, seem to scent from afar off
massacres and battles. The death of Cæsar, the civil war which resulted
from it and the bloody proscriptions of the Triumvirate were announced
by prodigies, of which Virgil speaks. A little before the war of
extermination which the Romans waged against the Jews, the Temple was
crowded by visions and marvels. The morbid miracles of the
convulsionaries, preceded by a short time only the hecatombs of the
Revolution, followed by the great wars of the Empire: nowadays the
spirits turn jugglers and the dead haunt our salons and become familiar
with ladies . . . we have just passed through the war with Germany and
the Commune, what have we still to expect?

Man, the child of Earth, remains in magnetic communication with the
Earth. He is himself a special magnet, which can indefinitely augment
its powers by the combination of imaginations and wills. Then

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

inert objects are magnetised, and, under the influence of the physical
soul of the Earth, attracted and ill-directed by man, may displace
themselves, be lifted up, and cause cracking noises or raps to be heard;
at times even a kind of aerial coagulation roughly models out some
fugitive form: people believe they see lights or hands; dreams take to
themselves bodies, and nature seems to become delirious: new pythonesses
scribble at hazard new oracles, as little serious as those of the
ancients: <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) the same causes produce
always the same effects.

Will man ever succeed in taming entirely this whirling and devouring
animal that we call the Earth? No, so long as he cannot discover a
fulcrum for the lever of Archimedes, and so long as the steed is always
sure of throwing its rider. In vain man torments the Earth; the Earth
will always end by swallowing him up. Hence it is that the grand dream
of Prometheus, that is to say of human genius, has always been the
secret of Hermes, that is to say

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

the discovery of a panacea for disease, old age and death, <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md)

The desire for immortality, which has always exercised the human soul,
is a protest against our subjection to the voracity of the Earth, but
Religion has placed immortality in death, and only flatters herself that
she will succeed in releasing from the slavery of Earth that portion of
ourselves that she wants to raise to Heaven.

But in the language of symbolism, Heaven is spirit and Earth is matter;
Heaven is light and Earth is shadow; Heaven is the good, Earth, the
evil; Heaven is paradise, and Earth, hell. The Theologians moreover who
believe in a local Hell can find no place

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

for it save in the middle of the Earth, which seems to affirm that evil
is materiality.

The Earth is lazy, because she is heavy and material, and, as laziness
produces starvation, the earth engenders imperfect species reduced to
devouring each other. She loves to produce beings who kill each other,
because she fattens on the corpses of her children. Warfare is the
inevitable condition of existence on the earth and the *raison d’être*
always definitely pertains to the strongest. Might does not take
precedence of Right; it constitutes it. What Darwin calls natural
selection is the triumph of might.

Why are there abortions in nature? Why so many imperfect designs if the
Creative Power is omnipotent? Because all Force has a Resistance as a
Fulcrum, because inertia battles against movement, because shadow must
equilibrise light. All is foreseen by the universal sovereign
intelligence, and the Providence of God is not a direct and personal
intervention. <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) If God does not
create animals, he tells the earth to produce them. God has impregnated
nature and nature has become a mother, producing unaided; but she
husbands her efforts and simplifies her great works; she produces life,
and life in its turn works on differentiating forms according to the
circumscribing conditions. One effort begets other efforts, one form
begets other forms, and progress is only possible through the law of
transformation.

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

These mysteries of nature demonstrate and explain those of Religion
which try to the utmost the Human understanding; Divine selection, that
is to say, final salvation, coupled with the probable reprobation of the
majority; the narrow gate, regeneration or moral transformation, the
resurrection or future transformation of the man that now is into a more
perfect being. So what has been looked on as calculated to shatter Faith
corroborates it, that which one fancied must overthrow Religion
reestablishes it. The asserted paradoxes of Darwin explain the oracles
of Jesus Christ, and we believe with greater assurance, because we know
better what we ought to believe. These truths will sooner or later
accomplish the conquest of opinion, and opinion when founded on Truth
always carries authority along with it. They begin with condemning
Galileo; later they are e’en forced to admit what he asserted, and the
Church is none the less infallible, because authority is necessary, and
when she transmits her authority to the Pope, the Pope becomes
infallible by an infallibility, authoritative, but not miraculous; for
an authority may be delegated, a miracle cannot be delegated.

The yearning for Religion is the primary want of the Human soul: it
exists side by side with Love, and in Love. "There exist," says Mr.
Tyndall, <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md) one of the foremost
scientific men of England, "there

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

exist other things woven into the tissue of man, such as the sentiments
of veneration, respect, admiration, and not only sexual love, to which
we have just referred, but the love of the Beautiful in nature, physical
and moral, of poetry and art; there is also that profound sentiment that
from the first dawn of History and probably for ages anterior to all
History, has incorporated itself in the Religions of the world; you may
laugh at these Religions, but in any case you only laugh at certain
accidents of form, and you will not touch the immovable basis of the
religious sentiment in the emotional nature of man. The problem of
problems at this present hour is to give to this sentiment a reasonable
satisfaction."

The solution of this great problem we believe that we have sufficiently
plainly indicated, to enable writers better accredited than ourselves to
discover it and give it with greater success to the legitimate
aspirations of the world. The spirit of intelligence will come as Christ
has promised us, and this will teach us all the Truth.

The doctrines of the highest science, called magic by the ancients,
being no longer recognised in our days by official science, can only be
presented to it under the name of Paradoxes, a word which signifies
things above reason.

Paracelsus, whose name signifies an elevation of thought in some way
paradoxical, designated these

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

the Archidoxes, that is to say, things ultra-reasonable or more than
reasonable. <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_137.md)

God is the great Archidox of the universe. Religion is Archidoxal when
it appears Paradoxical. Liberty is the Paradox or the Archidox of the
human divine.

Absolute reason, absolute knowledge, absolute love, are Archidoxes of
the human genius; imagination is Archidoxal in the creation and
realisation of its paradoxes.

The Will rushes on to the Archidox and does not halt before Paradox.

Absolute Reason is, like the Divinity, the supreme Archidox of the
understanding; the absolute for the mind is the unconditioned reason;
the absolute for the heart is infinite perfection; moreover, the
beautiful being the refulgence of the true, infinite beauty can only
exist in the ideal personification of Truth and Love. This
personification, realised in the man, is Christianity, realised in
society as a whole it will be Catholicity.

He who said, "I believe because it is absurd," gave us in a paradoxical
shape the formula of the Archidox, and, in fact alike beneath and above
reason only absurdity is to be found; but the absurdity which lies below
is nonsense and folly, while that

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

which floats above is enthusiasm and self-sacrifice. Below the reason of
the mass is materialism, above the reason of the scientific is God.
*Credo quia absurdum*!

Let us now complete our Magic Paradoxes by one last one that we will
call the Gospel of Science.

Gospel of Science! what an absurdity! As if Science could have a Gospel,
a Bible, a Koran, a Zend-Avesta or Vedas. All these sacred books pertain
exclusively to religion and the Priests of the several forms of worship,
and Science only concerns herself with them, to ascertain their
antiquity, authenticity and influence on the History of nations.

There is no true Gospel but that of Jesus Christ, but it is true that
there do exist Apocryphal Gospels.

To write in the present day an Apocryphal Gospel would be an
anachronism; to seek to give any other dogmatic Gospel but that of Jesus
Christ would be a folly and an impiety.

We employ, therefore, the word Gospel as a paradoxical expression, in
accordance with the title of this work which is Magical Paradoxes.

The word Gospel signifies happy news, and it would be indeed happy news
for the world to learn that science and religion had been definitively
harmonised.

But everything comes in its due season, and the world is not saved
because an eccentric book has been written.

Occult sciences are necessarily eccentric, for so soon as they cease to
be eccentric, they cease to be occult.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

A seed is placed within the earth; no one sees it but he who sows it,
and when the earth has closed upon it, no one again sees it. Men pass
close to where it is hidden, they even walk above it and for long it
ferments and germinates in silence. Then a tiny shoot pierces the earth,
the shoot divides into two leaves, and between these two leaves a bud
appears. Thus it remains for long without any one noticing it. One day
it is found that the shoot has become a sapling, then the sapling grows
larger and becomes, slowly, a tree.

Then oft-times he who sowed it is himself enveloped in the earth.

He will never gather his fruits from his tree, nor sit beneath its
shade.

His body fattens the earth and may cause other trees to germinate; his
thought grows in the heavens and will make other thoughts blossom. *For
nothing dies; all is transformed; that which no longer is, shall be
again, but that which was small shall be great, and that which was ill
shall be better*. <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md)

This is our faith and hope--AMEN, and so be it!
