# PREFACE To the 1922 Second Edition

MANY paths lead to the mountain-top, and many and diverse are the rifts
in the Veil, through which glimpses may be obtained of the secret things
of the Universe.

The Abbé Louis Constant, better known by his *nom de plume* of ÉLIPHAS
LÉVI, was doubtless a seer; but, though his studies were by no means
confined to this, he saw only through the medium of the kabala, the
perfect sense of which is, now-a-days, hidden from all *mere* kabalists,
and his visions were consequently always imperfect and often much
distorted and confused.

Moreover, he was for a considerable portion of his career a Roman
Catholic priest, and as such had to keep terms, to a certain extent,
with his church, and even later, when he was unfrocked, he hesitated to
shock the prejudices of the public, and never succeeded in even wholly
freeing *himself* from the bias of his early clerical training.
Consequently he not only erred at times in good faith, not only
constantly wrote ambiguously to avoid a direct collision with his
ecclesiastical chiefs or current creeds, but he not unfrequently put
forward Dogmas, which, taken in their obvious straightforward meanings,
he certainly did not *believe*--nay, I may say, certainly knew to be
false. It is quite true that, in many of these latter cases, an
undercurrent of irony may be discerned by those who know the truth, and
that in all the enlightened can sufficiently read between the lines to
avoid misconceptions. But these defects, the ineradicable bias of his
early training, the very narrow standpoint from which he regarded
occultism, and the limitations to free expression imposed on him by his
position and temperament, seriously detract

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

from the value of all Éliphas Lévi's writings.

Still, he was an eloquent and learned man, and sufficiently advanced in
occultism to render all he wrote on this subject interesting and more or
less valuable to earnest students of the Mysteries; and I have,
therefore, thought that fellow-searchers for the Hidden Truth would be
well pleased to obtain access to some important and hitherto unpublished
writings of this great kabalist.

Hence this translation, which, although absolutely without pretensions
to literary merit, yet does, I hope and believe, everywhere fully and
faithfully reproduce the *obvious* meanings of the author, leaving, in
all cases, where this is so in the original, an inner meaning
discernible by those who KNOW. If in many places the language appears
constrained and awkward, this has arisen from the necessity of
preserving intact the exoteric and esoteric meanings, which our author
so loved to combine in his epigrammatic sentences.

An eminent occultist, E. O., had added a few notes to the MSS. before it
reached my hands, and these, which I have reproduced (though some of
them will seem scarcely *relevant* to the uninitiated), merit the most
careful attention. I too have here and there ventured a few remarks,
which must be taken for what they are worth. I do not always agree with
E. O., and, though perfectly aware that my opinion is as nothing when
opposed to his, I did not think it honest to reproduce remarks, which I
could not concur in, without recording my dissent.

For the rest, any reader who, interested in these Paradoxes, yet feels
uncertain at their conclusion that he has fully grasped the author's
meaning and desires to know more of this, may with advantage study
Éliphas Lévi's other works, viz.--

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

> DOGME ET RITUEL DE LA HAUTE MAGIE.  
> HISTOIRE DE LA MAGIE.  
> LA CLEF DES GRANDS MYSTÈRES.  
> LA SCIENCE DES ÉSPRITS.  
> LE SORCIER DE MEUDON.  
> FABLES ET SYMBOLES.

Each one of these amongst, it must be admitted, a mass of irrelevant and
I had almost said *trashy* matter, redeemed only by a grace of style
necessarily lost in any translation, throws some light upon each one of
the others; and no one with any natural capacity for occultism can study
these carefully, along with what is now published, without clearly
apprehending our author's views. These, however limited and imperfect,
were yet, to a great extent and so far as they went, correct, and were
moreover, if nothing else, far in advance of most existing and accepted
*exoteric* cosmogonies, theogonies and religions.

One word more: Occultism has its Physics and Metaphysics, its practical
and theoretical sides. Éliphas Lévi was a theorist and, if we may judge
from the nonsense given in great detail in his RITUEL DE LA HAUTE MAGIE,
profoundly ignorant of its practice. Of the Physics of Occultism nothing
of any great value can be gathered by the uninitiated from his pages,
though reproducing, apparently without by any means fully comprehending
them, phrases and ideas from the older Hermetic works; secrets, even
pertaining to *this* branch, lie buried, like mutilated torsos, in his
writings. But where the Metaphysics of Occultism are concerned his works
are often encrusted with real jewels that would shine out far more
clearly into the soul of the uninitiated but for his persistent habit of
laying on everywhere coats of Roman

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Catholic and orthodox whitewash, partly in his
earlier days to avert the antagonism of the church, partly to avoid
shocking the religious prejudices of his readers, and partly I suspect,
because to the last some flavour of those prejudices clung even to his
own mind.

To those then who desire to acquire proficiency in Practical Occultism,
who crave long life, gifts and powers, and a knowledge of the hidden
things and laws of the universe, a study of Éliphas Lévi's books would
be almost time wasted. Let them seek elsewhere for what they want, and
*if they seek in earnest they will surely find it*.

But by those who, careless of such things, desire only to grapple with
and assimilate the highest and ultimate TRUTHS of Occultism more may
perhaps be gleaned from his pages by thoughtful study, than from those
of any writer, past or present, *whose works are readily accessible to
the world*.

To such seekers I say, study Éliphas Lévi's works as a whole and ponder
over them. Doubtless they are encumbered by a mass of what, but for the
elegance of the diction, would deserve to be set down as twaddle.
Doubtless our Abbé was a true Frenchman, often aiming more at felicity
of expression and neatness of antithesis than at the simple truth, and
ever ready to jump from the sublimest spiritual truth to some cynical
mundane jest by no means always in the best possible taste. Doubtless
too he perpetually wastes time (for most modern readers) in slaying over
again the already defunct bugbears, bogies and monsters of the Roman
Catholic Church.

But none the less had he much real occult learning, and this, though in
a purposely bewildering, inconsecutive and incoherent form, he put
piecemeal on record in his various works.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

Truly, though wrapped by his eloquence in cloth of gold, not an inviting
heap! Yet, despite the mass of shells and sand and ancient fishy odours,
the pearls are there for those who truly seek. A hint in one work, a
bantering falsehood in one passage, will explain veiled truths in
others; to those who strive hard to grasp them his real meanings will
become clear; and though the labour be considerable and the results,
even when obtained, imperfect and requiring to be supplemented
elsewhere, the trouble will not have been wasted; and those who have
advanced thus far will assuredly find unexpected help in completing
their task.
