### CHAPTER X.

### OF THE SUPREME BEING.

\[Twenty-fourth dialogue of the Book of the Pitris.\]

After giving as a text the words of the Atharva-Veda, and a few verses
from Manu, which we have just quoted, the Agrouchada-Parikchai devotes
the twenty-fourth lesson of the Guru to the study of the Supreme Being.
The principles of cause and harmony lead human reason to the absolute
notion of a *superior and universal cause*.

"He who denies this cause for the whole," says the Book of the Pitris,
"has no right to assign any cause to any particular fact. If you say the
universe exists because it exists, it is unnecessary to go any further;
man lives only by facts, and he has no assurance otherwise of the
invariability of natural laws."

Having shown that the belief in a superior and universal cause, in the
Supreme Being, lies at the basis of all science and, pre-eminently, of
axiomatic truth, the Guru of initiations borrows from Manu and the Vedas
the definition of this primordial force, whose mysterious and sacred
name it is forbidden to utter.

"It is he who exists by himself, and who is in all, because all is in
him.

"It is he who exists by himself, because the mind alone can perceive
him; who cannot be apprehended by our sensual organs. Who is without
visible parts, eternal the soul of all beings, and none can comprehend
him.

"He is one, immutable, devoid of parts or form, infinite,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent. He it is who has created the
heavens and the worlds out of chaos, and has set them whirling through
infinite space. He is the motor, the great original substance, the
efficient and material cause of everything."

"Behold the Ganges as it rolls, it is he; the ocean as it mutters, it is
he; the cloud as it thunders, it is he; the lightning as it flashes, it
is he; as from all eternity the world was in the mind of Brahma, so now
everything that exists is in his image."

"He is the author and principle of all things, eternal, immaterial,
everywhere present, independent, infinitely happy, exempt from all pain
or care, the pure truth, the source of all justice, he who governs all,
who disposes of all, who rules all, infinitely enlightened, infinitely
wise, without form, without features, without extent, without condition,
without name, without caste, without relation, of a purity that excludes
all passion, all inclination, all compromise."

The Guru, with the Pouranas, discusses these sublime questions, to which
he returns the following answers:

"Mysterious spirit, immense force, inscrutable power, how was thy power,
thy force, thy life manifested before the period of creation? Wast thou
dormant in the midst of disintegrating matter, like an extinct sun? Was
the dissolution of matter in thyself or was it by thy order? Wert thou
chaos? Did thy life include all the lives that had escaped the shock of
the destroying elements? If thou wert life, thou wert also death, for
there can be no destruction without movement, and motion could not exist
without thee."

"Didst thou cast the worlds into a blazing furnace in order that they
might be regenerated, in order that they might be born again, from their
decomposing elements, as an old tree springs again from the seed in the
midst of its corruption?"

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

"Did thy spirit wander over the waters, thy name being Narayana?

"The immortal germ," went on the Guru, "whose terrible name should not
be spoken, is the ancient of days. Nothing existed without him; nothing
was apart from him; he causeth life, motion, and light to shine through
infinity; everything comes from him and everything goes back to him; he
is constantly fertilizing the universe, through an intimate union with
his productive thought.

"Hear ye, this has been revealed to the sages in the silence of solitary
places, upon the banks of unfrequented torrents, in the mysterious
crypts of temples."

![](img/3stars.jpg)

This is what no profane ear should hear. This is what has been from all
eternity, which never had any beginning and will have no end.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Listen to the hymn of eternal love:

![](img/3stars.jpg)

He is one and he is two. He is two, but he is three. The one contains
two principles, and the union of these two principles produces the
third.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

He is one and he is all, and this one contains the husband and the wife,
and the love of the husband for the wife, and of the wife for the
husband, produces the third, which is the son.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The husband is as ancient as the wife, and the wife is as ancient as the
husband, and the son is also as ancient as

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

the husband and wife, and the one that contains all three is called

A

U         M

*Three in One*.

This is given as the meaning of the sublime monosyllable. It is the
image of the ancient of days.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The union of the husband and the wife continues forever, and from the
transports of their eternal love the son constantly receives life, which
he unceasingly drops into infinity, like so many millions of dew-drops
fertilized by the divine love.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Every drop of dew that falls is an exact representation of the great
al\], an atom of the Paramatma or universal soul, and each of these
atoms possesses the two principles that beget the third.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

So everything goes by three in the universe, from the infinite to which
everything descends, to the infinite to which everything ascends, with a
motion similar to that of an endless chain revolving about a wheel.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The first appearance of atoms is in the state of fertilized germs. They
collect together and form matter which is being continually transformed
and improved by the three grand principles of life; water, and heat, and
by the pure fluid, called Agasa.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Agasa, the pure fluid, is life itself. It is the soul. It is man. The
body is only an envelope, an obedient slave.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

As the seed, which germinates, bursts through its shell, and shoots out
of the ground, Agasa lays gradually aside the material veil, beneath
which its transformation takes place, and purifies itself. Upon leaving
the earth, it passes through the fourteen more perfect regions, and
every time it abandons its former envelope, and clothes itself with one
more pure.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Agasa, the vital fluid—the soul—animates the human body upon earth. In
infinite space, it put on the aerial form of the Pitris or spirits.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Human souls before being absorbed in the supreme soul, ascend through
the fourteen following degrees of superior spirits.

*The Pitris* are the immediate souls of our ancestors, still living in
the terrestrial circle, and communicating with men, just as more perfect
man communicates with the animal world.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Above the Pitris, but having nothing in common with the earth, are,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The somapas,

The agnidagdhas,

The agnanidagdhas,

The agnichwattas,

The cavias,

the barhichads,

The sômyas,

The havichmats,

The adjyapas,

The soucalis,

The sadbyas.

</div>

Spirits inhabiting the planets and stars.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

The two highest degrees were those of the Marîtchis and of the
Pradjapatis, who were superior spirits, and would soon arrive at the end
of their transmigrations and be absorbed in the great soul.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

This is called the progressive transformation of just spirits who have
spent their terrestrial life in the practice of virtue. The following
are the transformations of the bad spirits:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The yakchas,

The rakchasas,

The pisatchas,

The gandharba.

The apsaras,

The assouras,

The nagas,

The sarpas,

The souparnas,

The kinnaras.

</div>

Bad spirits who are constantly attempting to creep into the bodies of
men, and return to terrestrial life, which they have to pass through
anew.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

These bad spirits are the malign secretions of the universe. Their only
means of regaining the degree of purity required for the higher
transformations, is through thousands and thousands of transformations
into minerals, plants, and animals.

The superior pradjapatis are ten in number; the three first,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Marîtchi,

Atri,

Angiras,

</div>

represent eternal reason, wisdom, and intelligence.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

The second three,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Poulastya,

Poulaha,

Cratou,

</div>

represent the goodness, power, and majesty of the Divine Being.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The last triad,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Vasichta,

Pratchetas,

Brighou,

</div>

are the agents of creation, preservation, and transformation. They are
the direct ministers of the manifested trinity.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The last, called

Narada,

represents the intimate union of all the Pradjapatis in the mind of the
Self-existent Being, and the unceasing production of the thousands of
beings by whom nature is constantly being rejuvenated and the work of
creation is being perpetuated.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

These qualities of reason, wisdom, intelligence, goodness, power,
majesty, creation, preservation, transformation, and union, which are
being constantly diffused throughout nature, under the influence of the
superior spirits, are the unceasing product of the love of the divine
husband for his celestial spouse. In this way the great being maintains
his eternal life, which is that of all beings.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

For all things in the universe only exist and move and undergo
transformation, in order that the existence of the Great All may be
perpetuated, renewed, and purified.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

That is the reason why nothing exists outside of his essence and
substance, and that all creatures contain in themselves the principles
of reason, wisdom, intelligence, goodness, power, majesty, creation,
preservation, transformation, and union, and are the image of the ten
Pradjapatis, who are themselves a direct emanation from the divine
power.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

The departure of the soul-atom from the bosom of divinity is a radiation
from the life of the *Great All*, who expends his strength in order that
he may grow again, and in order that he may live by its return. God
thereby acquires a new vital force, purified by all the transformations
that the soul-atom has undergone.

![](img/3stars.jpg)

Its return is the final reward. Such is the secret of the evolutions of
the Great Being, and of the supreme soul, the mother of all souls.

After fully setting forth the above system with regard to God, the soul,
and perpetual creation, the most astonishing system, perhaps, that the
world has ever produced, and which contains within itself, substantially
under a mystical form, all the philosophical doctrines that have ever
agitated the human mind, the Book of the Pitris closes the present
chapter, from which we have eliminated its interminable invocations and
hymns to the creative power, by the following comparison:

"The Great All, which is constantly in motion and is constantly
undergoing change in the visible and invisible universe, is like the
tree which perpetuates itself by its seed, and is unceasingly creating
the same identical types."

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

Thus, according to the belief of those who had been initiated, God is
the whole, the soul is the atom which undergoes progressive
transformation, is purified and ascends to its eternal source, and the
universe is the reunited body of atoms in process of transformation.

As man upon earth is in direct communication with the souls of plants
and of inferior animals, so the Pitris, having clothed themselves with a
fluidic (fluidique) body, and having attained the first of the fourteen
superior degrees, are always in communication with man.

There is an uninterruptedly ascending scale, the links of which are
never broken:

The Pitris are in relation with the Somapas (spirits).

The Somapas with the Agnidagdhas.

The Agnidagdhas with the Agnanidagdhas.

The Agnanidagdhas with the Agnichwatas.

And so on up to the Pradjapatis, who are in direct communication with
God.

 

In each of these categories the spirit assumes a more perfect body and
continues to move in a circle of laws, which may be called
*superterrestrial* but which are not *supernatural*.

The Book of the Pitris says positively that the spirits preserve their
sex, whatever may be the superior categories to which they may attain;
that they are united together by the ties of a love which is totally
unlike every form of earthly passion. These unions are always prolific
and give birth to beings who possess all the qualities of their parents,
enjoy the same happiness, and are not tied down to the transformations
of this lower world.

It is possible, however, as the Pitris enjoy the utmost freedom of will,
that they may commit some exceptionally grave fault and be degraded, in
consequence, to the condition of man. Upon this point the
Agrouchada-Parikchai alludes to a revolt of the Pitris, that happened a
long while

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

ago, but makes no further explanation. Some of them are supposed to have
been cast down to earth again.

There is every reason to suppose, from the close similarity existing
between their various religious traditions, that this legend found its
way, through the process of initiation, from the Hindu temples into the
mysteries of Chaldea and Egypt, and thus gave birth to the myth of the
first sin.

Those Pitris which have not passed the degree immediately above that of
man, are the only spirits which are in communication with the latter.
They are regarded as the ancestors of the human race and its natural
directors from whom it derives its inspiration. They are themselves
inspired by the spirits of the next degree above them, and so on, from
one degree to another, until the divine word or, in other terms, until
revelation is imparted to man.

The Pitris are not equal to each other. Each category forms a separate
and complete world, in the likeness of our own, only more perfect, in
which there is the same diversity of intelligence and function.

According to this theory, it will be readily understood that man cannot
live isolated from his ancestors. It is only by the aid of their
instruction and help that he can arrive in the shortest possible time at
the transformation by means of which he becomes united to them.

Upon this belief is based the whole theory of initiation.

But men upon earth are not fitted to receive communications from a
higher world. Some are naturally inclined toward evil and do not care to
improve their characters: others still feel the effect of the previous
lives which they have spent in the form of animals, and their spirits
are entirely dominated by matter. It is only after many generations have
been spent in the practice of virtue that the soul becomes spiritualized
and the pure fluid called Agasa is developed, by means of which
communication is established.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Hence the natural inequality of men and the necessity that those who
have arrived at the highest degree of development should unite in the
study of the great secrets of life and of the forces of nature, that
they may set them in motion.

"It is only by constant fasting, mortification, prayer, and meditation,"
says the Agrouchada-Parikchai, "that man can arrive at complete
separation from everything that surrounds him. In that case he acquires
extraordinary power. Time, space, capacity, weight are of no
consequence. Hey has all the Pitris at his command and through them all
the superior spirits likewise. He attains a power of thought and action
of which formerly he had no conception, and sees through the curtain
that hangs before the splendors of human destiny."

But while there are mediating and directing spirits who are always ready
to come at his call, to point the way to virtue, there are also others
which have been condemned for their misdeeds in this, their earthly
life, to undergo again all their previous transmigrations, commencing
with mineral and plant life; they float about in infinity until they can
seize upon some unoccupied particle of matter, which they can use as an
envelope: they employ all the resources of their miserable intellects to
deceive and mislead men as to the means by which they can arrive at the
supreme and final transformation. These bad spirits are constantly
occupied in tormenting pious hermits during their sacrifices, initiates
in the midst of their studies, and sannyassis in their prayers, and it
is impossible to drive them away, except through the possession of the
secret of magical conjurations.

Lastly, the whole system, the Great All, is perpetually preserved,
developed, and transformed through love.

The emblem of this love, the Trinity, contains within itself both the
husband and wife, and their perpetual embraces give birth to the son by
whom the universe is regenerated.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Everything that exists is composed of atoms that reproduce themselves by
threes—the germ, the womb, and the offspring—the father, the mother, the
child—after the pattern of that immortal Trinity which is welded
together in one being by whom the whole of nature is ruled, and the
soul-atom, at the close of its transformations, returns to the
ever-living source from which it sprang.

This grand and imposing conception gave birth, in the vulgar cult, to
that triple manifestation of the Trinity which was known in India as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Nara—Agni—Brahma—the Father,

Nari—Vaya—Vischnou—the Mother,

Viradj—Sourya—Siva—the Son.

</div>

It was known in Egypt under the following names:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Amon—Osiris—Horus—the Father,

Mouth—Isis—Isis—the Mother,

Khons—Horus—Malouli—the Son.

</div>

It was called in Chaldea:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Anou,

Nouah,

Bel.

</div>

In Polynesian Oceanica:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Taaroa,

Ina,

Oro.

</div>

And finally in Christianity:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The Father,

The Spirit,

The Word.

</div>

All the teachings of the temples grow out of the mysteries into which
the priests are initiated, and which they change into the grossest
symbols, in order to vulgarize them without divulging their secret
meaning.
