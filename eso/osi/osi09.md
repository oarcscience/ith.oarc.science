### CHAPTER VIII.

### THE THIRD DEGREE OF INITIATION.

It is not until he has spent a further period of twenty years in the
study of the occult sciences and manifestations that the Sannyassi
becomes a Sannyassi-Nirvany or Naked Cenobite, so called because he was
not to wear any garments whatever, thus indicating that he had broken
the last tie that bound him to the earth. We are limited to such means
of information as are obtainable by the uninitiated. The book of the
Pitris, or spirits, which is our guide in this inquiry, contains no
explanation with regard to the mysterious occupations in which the
Sannyassis-Nirvanys, who have been initiated in the third degree,
engage. The chapter devoted to this subject merely gives the following
magical words, of which the Brahmins would furnish us no explanation
whatever, which were inscribed in two triangles. They were:

</div>

We can only study the subject of the highest initiation in its
philosophical teachings regarding God and man. The phenomena performed
by the Nirvanys are not described in the book of Pitris.

We have not been able to glean much from private conversations with
Pourohitas, with regard to the actions of their superiors. It seems that
they live in a constant state of ecstatic contemplation, depriving
themselves of sleep as far as possible, and taking food only once a
week, after sunset.

They are never visible either in the grounds or inside the temples,
except on the occasion of the grand festival of fire, which occurs every
five years. On that day they appear at midnight upon a stand erected in
the centre of the sacred tank. They appear like spectres, and the
surrounding atmosphere is illumined by them by means of their
incantations. They seem to be in the midst of a column of light rising
from earth to heaven.

The air is filled with strange sounds, and the five or six hundred
thousand Hindus who have come from all parts of India to see these
demi-gods, as they are esteemed, prostrate themselves flat in the dust,
calling upon the souls of their ancestors.
