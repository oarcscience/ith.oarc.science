# PART THIRD.

## THE DOCTRINE OF THE PITRIS AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE JEWISH CABALA, OF PLATO, OF THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL, OF PHILO, OF THE PERSIANS, AND OF CHRISTIANITY.

<span class="small">It is not lawful to explain the history of creation
to two persons, or the history of the Mercaba even to one. If, however,
he is naturally a wise and intelligent man, he may be intrusted with the
heads of the chapters. (Extract from the Mischna, a Jewish cabalistic
work, portions of which were translated by A. Franck of the

As for the ten Sephiroth, there is no end, either in the future, or in
the past, nor in good or evil, nor in depth or height, nor in the east,
west, north, or south. The ten Sephiroth are like the fingers of the
hands to the number of ten, five on either side, but at the middle lays
the point of unity.

Keep your mouth closed that you may not speak of it, and your heart that
you may not think of it; and if your heart forgets itself, bring it back
again to its place, for that is the reason why the union was formed.
(Sephir Jéoziroh, a cabalistic work, translated by A. Franck, of the
Institute.)

# THE DOCTRINE OF THE PITRIS

###### AND

## THE JEWISH CABALA.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### CHAPTER I.

### ORIGIN OF THE CABALA.

In opposition to the outward observances with which the prescriptions of
the Bible are encumbered under the Jewish law, by which all intelligent
action, all freedom of the will are crushed out, there arose gradually
by its side, in response to a demand for a greater independence of
thought, and a wider philosophy, a mysterious doctrine which was known
by the name of the Jewish Cabala.

Those who believed in this doctrine, the object of which was to unfold
the secrets of the divine nature, as well as of the creation, wrapped
themselves up in silence and mystery like initiates in the Indian
temples. At distant intervals, says the illustrious Franck, in his
admirable book upon this mystic philosophy, <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) with innumerable precautions they partly
opened the doors of the sanctuary to some new adept, who was always
chosen among those particularly eminent for their intellectual ability,
and whose advanced age offered an additional proof of their wisdom and
discretion.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

When a new candidate was initiated into the mysteries of the Cabala, one
of the elders murmured in his ears the following words:

"O thou who hast now gone to the fountain-head of all the graces, be
careful, whenever tempted to do so, not to reveal the tenet of
emanation, which is a great mystery in the judgment of all Cabalists.
Another mystery is contained in the following words: 'Thou shalt not
tempt the Lord.'"

The necessity of a special initiation, an essential prerequisite of
which was that the candidate should be far advanced toward the close of
life, and the absolute secrecy which the person initiated was expected
to preserve with regard to whatever was revealed to him, were two points
of external discipline, in respect to which those who held to the
doctrine of the Pitris in India, and the believers in the Jewish Cabala
were very nearly agreed, though, in matters of belief, we shall soon see
they were united by ties that bound them still closer to each other. In
all times science has anxiously sought to discover the origin of the
philosophical system of the Hebrews, which presents many points of
resemblance with some of the Greek systems of Alexandria and with the
mystical beliefs of Arabia.

As the Cabala is manifestly older than the Alexandrian school, it cannot
be successfully held to have sprung from the latter, though it may have
been influenced by it to some extent. The most that can be claimed is
that both systems have drunk from the same source. As for the close
connection that seems to exist between it and the mystical philosophy of
the Arabs, we may well ask, with Messrs. Franck and Tholuck, who have
investigated the subject in all its bearings, "What conclusion are we to
draw from these many points of resemblance?"

"They are not of much importance, it is true, for what is similar in
both systems is to be found elsewhere in more

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

ancient systems. In the books of the Sabeans and Persians, for instance,
and also among the Neo-Platonists. On the other hand, the extraordinary
form under which these ideas are presented to us in the Cabala is unlike
that of the Arab mystics. In order to satisfy ourselves that the Cabala
really sprang from intercourse with the latter, we should find among
them some traces of the doctrine of the Zephiroth. But not a vestige of
it is to be met with. They knew of but one form under which God reveals
himself to himself. In this respect the Cabala is much more like the
doctrine of the Sabeans and Gnostics.

"No trace, either, is to be found among the Arabs of the doctrine of
metempsychosis, which occupies such a prominent position in the Hebrew
system. We also search their books in vain for the allegories we are
constantly meeting with in the Zohar, for those continual appeals to
tradition, for those daring and multitudinous personifications with
their endless genealogies, and for those astonishing and extraordinary
metaphors which harmonize so well with the spirit of the East."

These multitudinous incarnations and interminable genealogies, or, in
other words, these men elevating themselves to the infinite by the
improvement of their spiritual nature; this belief in the doctrine of
metempsychosis, and the tenet relating to the ten Zephiroth, or the
creative faculty of the divinity; such are the recognized bases of the
Cabalistic philosophy.

We have seen that the belief in the doctrine of the Pitris is based on
similar principles. The ten Zephiroth of the Hebrews are substantially
the same as the ten Pradjapatis of India, to whom all creatures are
indebted for their existence.

The Zohar, which is the principal work of the Cabala, speaking of the
philosophical system therein taught, says that it is precisely the same
as the wisdom which the children of the East have known from the
earliest times,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

"Evidently," says Franck, "this cannot refer to the Arabs, whom the
Hebrew writers invariably call *the children of Israel, or the children
of Arabia:* they would not speak of a foreign and contemporaneous
philosophy in such terms—the Zohar would not date it back from the
earliest ages of the world."

While the origin of the Cabala cannot be successfully sought for either
in the different systems of Greece or in the doctrines of the
Alexandrian school, notwithstanding they have many points in common, or
in the mystical philosophy of the Arabs; while, on the other hand, the
Zohar, tracing it back to the earliest ages, speaks of it as having the
East for its cradle; have we not good reason, therefore, in view of the
antiquity of India and the similarity in principle of both systems, to
say that the doctrine of the Cabala sprang from the doctrine of the
Pitris?

We should not forget that India, that immense and luminous centre in
olden times, besides spreading its ideas throughout the East, by means
of emigration, from the earliest times, was in constant communication
with all the people of Asia, and that all the philosophers and sages of
antiquity went there to study the science of life. It is not, therefore,
surprising that in periods of their captivity the elders of the Hebrews
should have been initiated by the Persian Magi into the old conceptions
of the Brahmins.

A few extracts from the Sepher Jeszireh and the Zohar, the two highest
prized works of the Cabala, as to the nature of God, the creation, and
the human soul, will show conclusively that this opinion is historically
correct.

We shall be brief, for while we cannot resist the temptation to devote a
few pages to the subject of these comparisons, we shall bear in mind
that we cannot dwell upon it at any great length, except at the expense
of our main subject.
