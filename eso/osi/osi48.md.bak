### CONCLUSION.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> conclusion, we can only repeat the
words of our preface:

"It is not our office to decide, either for or against, the belief in
spirits, whether *mediating* or *inspiring*."

Our aim is merely to give an account of the philosophical and
spiritualistic tenets of the Brahmins, as well as of the external
phenomena and manifestations which are, according to them, the means
whereby the Pitris, or ancestral shades, demonstrate their existence and
communicate with men.

All ancient religions, and even Christianity itself, acknowledge the
existence of extraordinary beings, who have a special part to perform in
the continuous movement of creation. All teach that man, upon laying
aside his present earthly envelope, enters the superior world in the
state of a spirit.

The constant perfectibility of the soul, and the spiritual life—that is
their common philosophical idea.

As for the phenomena and manifestations, which are claimed to be
supernatural, we also find them to be an outgrowth of this belief, both
in the temples of India, Chaldea, and Egypt, and in the catacombs to
which the early Christians fled for shelter.

We refrain from making any positive statement as to the possibility or
not of the extraordinary phenomena performed by the Fakirs, as we have
described them, which some attribute to the adroitest imposture and
others to occult intervention, but leave the reader to judge for
himself.
