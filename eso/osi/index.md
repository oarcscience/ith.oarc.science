This book was written in the 1860s, when reliable information about
Hinduism was just starting to filter back to the west. Jacolliot was
searching for the roots of western esoteric traditions in the far East.
The high point of this book is the travelogue of his encounters in India
with a *fakir*, who demonstrates his *siddis* (yogic powers)
exuberantly. There is also an extensive discourse on Kabbalah, and its
relationship to Eastern mystical beliefs. Jacolliot was a diffusionist,
and he believed that many western esoteric traditions, specifically
Egyptian, Jewish and Christian, had their origin in India.

Jacolliot, the author (1837-1890) was a French lawyer who worked as a
judge in India and Tahiti. He subsequently became a prolific author.
Although he apparently had enough familiarity with Sanskrit to do some
desultory translations of the Laws of Manu, Jacolliot was not an
academic. He quotes extensively here from a text called the
"Agrouchada-Parikchai," which appears to be a pastiche of the
Upanishads, Hindu law books, and a bit of Freemasonry. This text does
not seem to exist except in Jacolliot's imagination. Jacolliot also
believed in a lost Pacific continent, and was quoted by Helena Blavatsky
in [Isis Unveiled](../../the/iu/index.md) in support of Lemuria. --<span
