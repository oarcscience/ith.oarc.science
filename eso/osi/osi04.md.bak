### CHAPTER III.

### THE BRAHMIN—FROM HIS BIRTH TO HIS NOVITIATE—THE CEREMONY OF THE DJITA CARMA.

When a Brahmin's wife has given birth to a son, her husband is careful
to note upon his tablets the hour, the day, the year, and the epoch, of
the occurrence, together with the stars under whose auspices the child
has just been born.

He carries this information to the astronomer of the pagoda, who casts
the horoscope of the new-born child. Nine days thereafter a stand is
erected and decorated with flowers and foliage, upon which the mother
takes her seat, with the boy in leer arms.

An officiating Pourohita, or Brahmin belonging to the first class of
initiation, then performs the poudja, or sacrifice to Vischnou, in front
of the stand. He pours a little lustral water upon the child's head, and
into the hollow of the hands of the father and mother, who drink it, and
then he sprinkles all those present with the same liquid.

The father then brings a dish of earthenware, bronze, or silver,
according to his means, upon which is a little betel, and a present for
the Pourohita.

By this ceremony the child is purified from all the uncleanness attached
to his birth.

From this time, the mother, who since her confinement, has stayed in a
separate room, is obliged to live ten days longer by herself in a
retired place, at the end of which time she is allowed to go to the
temple, to purify herself from her uncleanness.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

It is unnecessary to call attention to the fact that a similar custom in
such cases prevailed among the Jews.

*The Ceremony of the Nahma-Carma.*

Twelve days afterward the ceremony of the giving of the name, or of the
Nahma-Carma, as it was called, took place.

The house was decorated as if for a festival, and all the relatives and
friends of the Brahmin caste alone were invited.

The father, after performing an oblation to the fire and the nine
principal divinities which rule the planets, transcribed with a brush
upon a wooden tablet the horoscope of his son, which was cast at the
pagoda, with the name that he proposed to give him.

He then uttered three times in a loud voice the name which he had just
written, which all present repeated after him. He closed with the
following words:

"Blessed be the name of Brahma. This is my son and his name is Narayana
\[or any other name\]. Listen attentively in order that you may remember
it."

He then went out of the house at the head of a procession consisting of
all his guests, and planted in his garden, or in front of the dwelling,
a cocoanut, tamarind, or palm tree, according to the section of country
where he resided, saying:

"In the name of the powerful and just Brahma, all you who are here
present, bear this, in mind. This tree is planted on Narayana's
name-day, in the thirty-fifth year of the fifth lunar century of the
third divine epoch" (or any given date).

This, as the reader will understand, is given merely as a matter of
form.

At the close of the ceremony, a grand feast is given, of

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

which all present partake. Previous to their departure, the father
presents to each a cup of cedar- or sandal-wood, upon which is engraved
the horoscope, or more generally the monogram of the child.

The object of this present is to furnish evidence, in case any dispute
should thereafter arise as to the legitimacy of the child's birth. When
summoned as witnesses before the caste tribunal, the guests appear with
their cups in their hands, and testify as follows:

"In the name of the powerful and just Brahma; the words which proceed
front my mouth are strictly true. This cup was given to me by Covinda,
on Narayana's name-day, in the thirty-fifth year of the fifth lunar
century of the third divine epoch. There can be no doubt that Narayana
is the son of Covinda."

The Pourohita, or Brahmin who is present at the ceremony, then offers a
sacrifice to the Pitris, or ancestral spirits, and asks them to protect
the new-born child.

The father then distributes betel among the guests and makes a present
to the officiating priest according to his means.

*The Ceremony of Anna-Prassana*.

When the child is in the seventh month of his age, rice is given him to
eat for the first time. This festival is called the *Anna-Prassana*.

As in the case of the other ceremonies the father invites all his
relatives and friends and sends to the pagoda for a Brahmin to
officiate. After a general bath in the tank of ablutions, upon which the
Pourohita has scattered a few drops of lustral water, all the guests
take their seats upon a stand decorated with branches of fruit-trees in
full bearing, and the priest offers a sacrifice to the lunar spirits
that protect the family.

Meanwhile, the women sing an appropriate psalm and

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

perform the ceremony of aratty (which has the property of driving away
evil spirits) above the child's head for the first time.

The priest then blesses the Brahminical girdle which is a sign of his
caste, and which is bound around the child's loins for the first time. A
little boiled rice is then put in his mouth, and everybody sits down to
the repast.

The ceremony terminates with the distribution of betel and a present to
the officiating priest.

*The Ceremony of the Tchaoula*.

When a child reaches the age of three years, the ceremony of the
Tchaoula, or the Tonsure, is performed.

This festival is much more solemn than the preceding, for the child, who
is present, is able for the first time to murmur the name of the
divinity, as well as the names of the protecting spirits of his home and
family.

After bathing and decorating the child with a necklace and bracelets of
mingled coral and sandal-wood beads, he is led beneath a pandal, which
is a sort of dais formed of trees procured for that purpose and of
flowers of every description.

He is surrounded by his relatives and guests and the priest offers an
oblation to all the Pitris, or family and ancestral shades, in both
branches, on the father's and mother's side.

The statue of Siva-Lingam, the image of perpetual fruitfulness, is
brought in covered with flowers and fruits.

At this point of the office the barber commences. After prostrating
himself in the presence of the god, in the midst of female singing,
accompanied by the musicians from the pagoda, he proceeds to shave the
child's head, leaving a small lock of hair on the back part, which is
never cut.

During this operation the child's female relatives perform the aratty
upon the heads of those present, in order

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

to drive away evil spirits, and everybody preserves a religious silence.

Having finished his duties, the barber retires with his pay, which
consists of a certain quantity of rice, and the priest cleanses the
child from any impurity which he may have derived from unclean contact
with the barber.

The child's toilet is then made anew, and after a fresh bath in the
sacred tank of ablutions, in order to propitiate all the spirits and
genii of the plants to which that day is consecrated the ceremony closes
as before with a repast and presents.

Until the age of nine years the Brahmin remains in the hands of the
women until the term for commencing his novitiate arrives.
