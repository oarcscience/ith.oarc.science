### THE TENTH LESSON.

#### SUB-CONSCIOUSING.

In the Ninth Lesson we called your attention to the fact that Reasoning
was not necessarily conscious in its operations, and that, in fact, a
large part of the rational processes of the mind are performed below or
above the field of consciousness. And in the Eighth Lesson we gave you a
number of examples illustrating this fact. We also gave you a number of
cases in which the sub-conscious field of the Intellect worked out
problems, and then after a time passed on to the conscious field of the
Intellect the solution of the matter. In this lesson we purpose
instructing you in the methods by which this part of the Intellect may
be set to work for you. Many have stumbled upon bits of this truth for
themselves, and, in fact, the majority of successful men and men who
have attained eminence in any walk of life have made more or less use of
this truth, although they seldom understand the reason of it.

Very few Western writers have recognized the work of this plane of the
mind. They have given us full and ingenious theories and examples of the
workings of the Instinctive Mind, and in some cases they have touched
upon the workings and operations of the Intuitional planes, but in
nearly every case they have treated the Intellect as something entirely
confined to the Conscious plane of mentation. In this

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

they have missed some of the most interesting and valuable
manifestations of sub-conscious mentation.

In this lesson we will take up this particular phase of mentation, and
trust to be able to point out the way to use it to the best advantage,
giving some simple instructions that have been given by the Hindu
teachers to their students for centuries past, such instructions of
course, being modified by us to conform to the requirements and
necessities of the Western student of today.

We have taken the liberty of bestowing a new title upon this phase of
mentation—we have thought it well to call it "Sub-consciousing." The
word "Sub," of course means "under; below;" and the word "Consciousing"
is a favorite term employed by Prof. Elmer Gates, and means receiving
impressions from the mind. In a general way, "Sub-consciousing," as used
in this lesson, may be understood to mean "using the subconscious mind,
under orders of the conscious mind."

By referring to our Eighth Lesson, we see on page
[177](ryo10.htm#page_177.md), mention made of the case of the man who
indulged in "unconscious rumination," which happened to him when he read
books presenting new points of view essentially opposed to his previous
opinion. You will note that after days, weeks, or months, he found that
to his great astonishment the old opinions were entirely rearranged, and
new ones lodged there.

On the same page you will see mentioned the case of Sir William
Hamilton, who discovered an important law of mathematics while walking
with his wife.

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In this case he
had been previously thinking of the missing link in his chain of
reasoning, and the problem was worked out for him by the sub-conscious
plane of his Intellect.

On the same page, and the one following, is found the case of Dr.
Thompson, who gives an interesting account of the workings of this part
of his mind, which caused him at times to experience a feeling of the
uselessness of all voluntary effort, coupled with a feeling that the
matter was working itself clear in his mind. He tells us that at times
he seemed to be merely a passive instrument in the hands of some person
other than himself, who compelled him to wait until the work was
performed for him by some hidden region of the mind. When the
subconscious part of the mind had completed its work, it would flash the
message to his conscious mind, and he would begin to write.

On page [178](ryo10.htm#page_178.md) mention is also made of the great
French chemist Berthelot, who relates that some of his best conceptions
have flashed upon him as from the clear sky. In fact, the Eighth Lesson
is largely made up of examples of this kind, and we ask the student to
re-read the same, in order to refresh his mind with the truth of the
workings of the sub-conscious mentality.

But you will notice in nearly all the cases mentioned, that those who
related instances of the help of the sub-conscious mind had merely
stumbled upon the fact that there was a part of the mind below
consciousness

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

that could and would work out problems for one, if it could somehow be
set in operation. And these people trusted to luck to start that part of
the mind in operation. Or rather, they would saturate their conscious
mind with a mass of material, like stuffing the stomach with food, and
then bid the subconscious mind assort, separate, arrange and digest the
mental food, just as does the stomach and digestive apparatus digest the
natural food—outside of the realm of consciousness or volition. In none
of the cases mentioned was the subconscious mind *directed* specially to
perform its wonderful work. It was simply hoped that it might digest the
mental material with which it had been stuffed—in pure self defense. But
there is a much better way, and we intend to tell you about it.

The Hindu Yogis, or rather those who instruct their pupils in "*Raja
Yoga*," give their students directions whereby they may *direct* their
sub-conscious minds to perform mental tasks for them, just as one may
direct another to perform a task. They teach them the methods whereby,
after having accumulated the necessary materials, they may bid the
sub-conscious mentality to sort it out, rearrange, analyze, and build up
from it some bit of desired knowledge. More than this, they instruct
their pupils to direct and order the sub-conscious mentality to search
out and report to them certain information to be found only within the
mind itself—some question of philosophy or metaphysics. And when such
art has been acquired, the

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

student or Yogi rests assured that the desired result will he
forthcoming in due time, and consequently dismisses the matter from his
conscious mind, and busies himself with other matters, knowing that day
and night, incessantly, the sub-consciousing process is going on, and
that the sub-conscious mind is actively at work collecting the
information, or working out the problem.

You will see at once the great superiority of this method over the old
"hit-or-miss," "hope-it-will-work" plan pursued by those who have
stumbled upon bits of the truth.

The Yogi teacher begins by impressing upon his students the fact that
the mind is capable of extending outward toward an object, material or
mental, and by examining it by methods inherent in itself, extracting
knowledge regarding the object named. This is not a startling truth,
because it is so common, everyone employing it more or less every day.
But the process by which the knowledge is extracted is most wonderful,
and really is performed below the plane of consciousness, the work of
the conscious mind being chiefly concerned in *holding the Attention*
upon the object. We have spoken of the importance of Attention in
previous lessons, which it will be well for you to re-read, at this
time.

When the student is fully impressed with the details of the process of
Attention, and the subsequent enfoldment of knowledge, the Yogi proceeds
to inform him that there are other means of obtaining knowledge

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

about an object, by the employment of which the Attention may he firmly
directed toward the object, and then afterwards held there
unconsciously—that is, a portion of the Attention, or a sub-conscious
phase of mentation, which will hold the sub-conscious mind firmly upon
the work until accomplished, leaving the conscious Attention and
mentality free to employ itself with other things.

The Yogis teach the students that this new form of Attention is far more
intense and powerful than is the conscious Attention, for it cannot be
disturbed or shaken, or distracted from its object, and that it will
work away at its task for days, months, years, or a lifetime if
necessary, according to the difficulty of the task, and in fact carries
its work over from one life to another, unless recalled by the Will.
They teach the student that in everyone's life there is going on a
greater or less degree of this sub-conscious work, carried on in
obedience to a strong desire for knowledge manifested in some former
life, and bearing fruit only in the present existence. Many important
discoveries have been made in obedience to this law. But it is not of
this phase of the matter that we wish to speak in this lesson.

The Yogi theory is that the sub-conscious intellectual faculty may be
set to work under the direction of orders given by the Will. All of you
know how the sub-conscious mentality will take up an order of the Will,
or a strong wish, that the person be awakened at a certain hour in order
to catch a train. Or, in the

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

same way how the remembrance of a certain engagement at, say, four
o'clock, will flash into the mind when the hands of the clock approach
the stated hour. Nearly every one can recall instances of this sort in
his own experience.

But the Yogis go much further than this. They claim that any and all
faculties of the mind may be "set going," or working on any problem, if
ordered thereto by the Will. In fact, the Yogis, and their advanced
students have mastered this art to such a surprising extent that they
find it unnecessary to do the drudgery of thinking in the conscious
field, and prefer to relegate such mental work to the sub-conscious,
reserving their conscious work for the consideration of digested
information and thought presented to them by the sub-conscious mind.

Their directions to their students cover a great deal of ground, and
extend over a long period of time, and many of the directions are quite
complicated and full of detail. But we think that we can give our
students an abbreviated and condensed idea in a few pages of the lesson.
And the remaining lessons of the course will also throw additional light
on the subject of sub-conscious mental action, in connection with other
subjects.

The Yogi takes the student when the latter is much bothered by a
consideration of some knotty and perplexing philosophical subject. He
bids the student relax every muscle,—take the tension from every
nerve—throw aside all mental strain, and then wait

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

a few moments. Then the student is instructed to grasp the subject which
he has had before his mind, firmly and fixedly before his mental vision,
by means of concentration. Then he is instructed to pass it on to the
sub-conscious mentality by an effort of the Will, which effort is aided
by forming a mental picture of the subject as a material substance, or
*bundle of thought*, which is being bodily lifted up and dropped down a
mental hatch-way, or trap-door, in which it sinks from sight. The
student is then instructed to say to the sub-conscious mentality: "I
wish this subject thoroughly analyzed, arranged, classified (and
whatever else is desired) and then the results handed back to me. Attend
to this."

The student is taught to speak to the sub-conscious mentality just as if
it were a separate entity of being, which had been employed to do the
work. He is also taught that *confident expectation* is an important
part of the process, and that the degree of success depends upon the
degree of this confident expectation.

In obstinate cases, the student is taught to use the Imagination freely,
until he is able to make a mental image or picture of the sub-conscious
mind doing what is required of it. This process clears away a mental
path for the feet of the sub-conscious mind, which it will choose
thereafter, as it prefers to follow the line of least resistance.

Of course much depends upon practice—practice makes perfect, you know,
in everything else, and sub-consciousing is no exception to the rule,

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

The student gradually acquires a proficiency in the art of
sub-consciousing, and thereafter devotes his time to acquiring new facts
for mental digestion, rather than bestowing it upon the mechanical act
of thinking.

But a very important point to be remembered is that the Will-power back
of the transferred thought-material, which Will-power is the cause of
the subconscious action, depends very greatly upon the attention and
interest given to the acquired material. This mass of thought-material
which is to be digested, and threshed out by the sub-conscious mind,
must be well saturated with interest and attention, in order to obtain
the best results. In fact interest and attention are such important aids
to the Will, that any consideration of the development and acquirement
of Will-power is practically a development and acquirement of attention
and interest. The student is referred to previous lessons in this course
in which the importance of interest and attention is explained and
described.

In acquiring the mass of thought-material which is to be passed on to
the sub-conscious digestion, one must concentrate a great degree of
interest and attention upon each item of thought-material gathered up.
The gathering of this thought-material is a matter of the greatest
importance, and must not be lightly passed by. One cannot hastily gather
together all sorts of thought-material, and then expect the subconscious
mind to do its work properly—it will not,

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

in fact, and the student proceeding upon any such erroneous supposition
is doomed to disappointment.

The proper way to proceed, is to take up each bit of thought-material in
turn, and examine it with the greatest possible interest, and
consequently the greatest attention, and then after having fairly
saturated it with this interested attention, place it with the pile of
material which, after a while, is to be passed on to the sub-conscious
mentality. Then take up the next bit of material, and after giving it
similar treatment, pass it along to the pile also. Then after a while
when you have gathered up the main facts of the case, proceed to
consider the mass as a whole, with interest and attention, giving it as
it were a "general treatment." Then drop it down the trap-door into the
sub-conscious mind, with a strong command, "Attend to this
thought-material," coupled with a strong expectant belief that your
order will be obeyed.

The idea underlying this treatment of the thought-material with interest
and attention is that by so doing a strong "Mental Image" is created,
which may be easily handled by the sub-conscious mind. Remember that you
are passing on "thoughts" for the sub-consciousness to act upon, and
that the more tangible and real these thoughts are, the better can they
be handled. Therefore any plan that will build these thoughts up into
"real" things is the plan to pursue. And attention and interest produce
just this result.

If we may be pardoned for using a homely and commonplace illustration we
would say that the idea may

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

be grasped by the illustration of boiling an egg, whereby the fluid
"white" and "yolk" becomes solid and real. Also the use of a shaving
brush by a man, by which the thin lather is gradually worked up into a
rich, thick, creamy mass, is an illustration. Again, the churning of
butter is a favorite illustration of the Hindus, who thus call the
attention of their students to the fact that thought-material if worked
upon with attention and interest become "thought-forms" that may be
handled by the mind just as the hands handle a material object. We ask
you to think of these illustrations, for when you once grasp the idea
that we wish to convey to you, you will have the secret of great
thinking powers within your grasp.

And this power of sub-consciousing is not confined alone to the
consideration of philosophical questions. On the contrary it is
applicable to every field of human thought, and may be properly employed
in any and all of them. It is useful in solving the problems of
every-day life and work, as well as to the higher flights of the human
mind. And we wish every one of our students to realize that in this
simple lesson we are giving them the key to a great mental power.

To realize just what we are offering to you, we would remind you of the
old fairy tales of all races, in which there is to be found one or more
tales telling of some poor cobbler, or tailor, or carpenter, as the case
may be, who had by his good deeds, gained favor with the "brownies" or
good fairies, who would come each night when the man and his family were
asleep,

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

and proceed to complete the work that the artisan had laid out for the
morrow. The pieces of leather would be made into shoes; the cloth would
be sewed into garments; the wood would be joined, and nailed together
into boxes, chairs, benches and what not. But in each case the rough
materials were prepared by the artisan himself during the day.

Well, that is just what we are trying to introduce to you. A clan of
mental brownies, loving and kindly disposed toward you, who are anxious
and willing to help you in your work. All you have to do is to give them
the proper materials, and tell then what you want done, and they will do
the rest. But these mental brownies are a part of your own mentality,
remember, and no alien and foreign entities, as some have imagined.

A number of people who have accidentally discovered this power of the
sub-conscious mind to work out problems, and to render other valuable
service to its owner, have been led to suppose that the aid really came
from some other entity or intelligence. Some have thought that the
messages came from friends in the spirit land, and others have believed
that some high intelligence—God or his angels—was working in their
behalf. Without discussing spirit communication, or Divine messages, in
both of which we believe (with certain provisional reservations) we feel
justified in saying that the majority of cases of this kind may be
referred to the sub-conscious workings of one's own mentality.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

Each of us has "a friend" in our own mind—a score of them in fact, who
delight in performing services for us, if we will but allow them to do
so. Not only have we a Higher Self to whop, we may turn for comfort and
aid in times of deep distress and necessity, but we have these invisible
mental workers on the sub-conscious plane, who are very willing and glad
to perform much of our mental work for us, if we will but give them the
material in proper shape.

It is very difficult to impart specific directions for obtaining these
results, as each case must depend to a great extent upon the peculiar
circumstances surrounding it. But we may say that the main thing needed
is to "lick into shape" the material, and then pass it on to the
sub-conscious mind in the manner spoken of a few moments ago. Let us run
over a few cases wherein this principle may be applied.

Let us suppose that you are confronted with a problem consisting of an
uncertainty as to which of two or more courses to adopt in some affair
of life. Each course seems to have advantages and disadvantages, and you
seem unable to pass upon the matter clearly and intelligently. The more
you try the more perplexed and worried do you become. Your mind seems to
tire of the matter, and manifests a state which may be called "mental
nausea." This state will be apparent to any one who has had much
"thinking" to do. The average person, however, persists in going over
the matter, notwithstanding the tired condition of the mind, and its
evident distaste for a further consideration

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

of the subject. They will keep on forcing it back to the mind for
consideration, and even at night time will keep thrashing away at the
subject. Now this course is absurd. The mind recognizes that the work
should be done by another part of itself—its digestive region, in
fact—and naturally rebels at the finishing-up machinery being employed
in work unsuited for it.

According to the Sub-consciousing plan, the best thing for the man to do
would be for him first to calm and quiet his mind. Then he should
arrange the main features of the problem, together with the minor
details in their proper places. Then he should pass them slowly before
him in review, giving a strong interest and attention to each fact and
detail, as it passes before him, *but without the slightest attempt to
form a decision, or come to a conclusion*. Then, having given the matter
an interested and attentive review, let him Will that it pass on to his
sub-conscious mind, forming the mental image of dropping it through the
trap-door, and at the same time giving the command of the Will, "Attend
to this for me!"

Then dismiss the matter from your conscious mind, by an effort of
command of the Will. If you find it difficult to do this, you may soon
acquire the mastery by a frequent assertion, "I have dismissed this
matter from my conscious mind, and my sub-conscious mind will attend to
it for me." Then, endeavor to create a mental feeling of perfect trust
and confidence in the matter, and avoid all worry or anxiety about it.
This

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

may be somewhat difficult at the first trial, but will become a natural
feeling after you have gained the confidence arising from successful
results in several cases. The matter is one of practice, and, like
anything else that is new, must be acquired by perseverance and
patience. It is well worth the time and trouble, and once acquired will
be regarded as something in the nature of a treasure discovered in an
unexpected place. The sense of tranquillity and content—of calm and
confidence—that comes to one who leas practiced this plan, will of
itself be worth all the trouble, not to speak of the main result. To one
who has acquired this method, the old worries, frettings, and general
"stewed up" feeling, will seem like a relic of barbarism. The new way
opens up a world of new feelings and content.

In some cases the matter will be worked out by the sub-conscious mind in
a very short time, and in fact we have known cases in which the answer
would be flashed back almost instantly, almost like an inspiration. But
in the majority of cases more or less time is required. The
sub-conscious mind works very rapidly, but it takes time to arrange the
thought-material properly, and to shape it into the desired forms. In
the majority of cases it is well to let the matter rest until the next
day—a fact that gives us a clue to the old advice to "sleep over" an
important proposition, before passing a final decision.

If the matter does not present itself the following day, bring it up
again before the conscious mind for

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

review. You will find that it has shaped itself up considerably, and is
assuming definite form and clearness. But right here—and this is
important—do not make the mistake of again dissecting it, and meddling
with it, and trying to arrange it with your conscious mind. But,
instead, give it attention and interest in its new form, and then pass
it back again to the sub-conscious mind for further work. You will find
an improvement each time you examine it. But, right here another word of
caution. Do not make the mistake of yielding to the impatience of the
beginner, and keep on repeatedly bringing up the matter to see what is
being done. Give it time to have the work done on it. Do not be like the
boy who planted seeds, and who each day would pull them up to see
whether they had sprouted, and how much.

Sooner or later, the sub-conscious mind will, of its own choice, lift up
the matter and present it to you in its finished shape for the
consideration of the conscious mind. The sub-conscious mind does not
insist that you shall adopt its views, or accept its work, but merely
hands out to you the result of its sorting, classifying and arranging.
The choice and will still remains yours, but you will often find that
there is seen to be one plan or path that stands out clearly from the
others, and you will very likely adopt that one. The secret is that the
sub-conscious mind with its wonderful patience and care has analyzed the
matter, and has separated things before apparently connected. It has
also found resemblances and has combined

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

things heretofore considered opposed to each other. In short it has done
for you all that you could have done with the expenditure of great work
and time, and done it well. And then it lays the matter before you for
your consideration and verdict.

Its whole work seems to have been in the nature of assorting,
dissecting, analyzing, and arranging the evidence, and then presenting
it before you in a clear, systematic shape. It does not attempt to
exercise the judicial prerogative or function, but seems to recognize
that its work ceases with the presentation of the edited evidence, and
that of the conscious mind begins at the same point.

Now, do not confuse this work with that of the Intuition, which is a
very different mental phase or plane. This sub-conscious working, just
mentioned, plays an entirely different part. It is a good servant, and
does not try to be more. The Intuition, on the contrary, is more like a
higher friend—a friend at court, as it were, who gives us warnings and
advice.

In our directions we have told you how to make use of this part of the
mind, consciously and knowingly, so as to obtain the best results, and
to get rid of worry and anxiety attendant upon unsettled questions. But,
in fact, every one of us makes more or less use of this part of the mind
unconsciously, and not realizing the important part it plays in our
mental life. We are perplexed about a matter and keep it "on our minds"
until we are forced to lay it aside by reason of some other demand, or
when we sink to sleep. Often to

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

our surprise we will find that when we next think of it the matter has
somehow cleared up and straightened itself out, and we seem to have
learned something about it that we did not know before. We do not
understand it, and are apt to dismiss it as "just one of those things."
In these lessons we are attempting to explain some of "those things,"
and to enable you to use them consciously and understandingly, instead
of by chance, instinctively, and clumsily. We are teaching you Mastery
of the Mind.

Now to apply the rule to another case. Suppose you wish to gather
together all the information that you possess relating to a certain
subject. In the first place it is certain that you know a very great
deal more

about any subject than you think you do. Stored away in the various
recesses of the mind, or memory if you prefer that term, are stray bits
of information and knowledge concerning almost any subject. But these
bits of information are not associated with each other. You have never
attempted to think attentively upon the particular question before you,
and the facts are not [correlated](errata.htm#10.md) in the mind. It is
just as if you had so many hundred pounds of anything scattered
throughout the space of a large warehouse, a tiny bit here, and a tiny
bit there, mixed up with thousands of other things.

You may prove this by sitting down some time and letting your thoughts
run along the line of some particular subject, and you will find
emerging into the field of consciousness all sorts of information that
you

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

had apparently forgotten, and each fitting itself into its proper place.
Every person has had experiences of this kind. But the work of gathering
together the scattered scraps of knowledge is more or less tedious for
the conscious mind, and the sub-conscious mind will do the work equally
well with the wear and tear on the attention. In fact, it is the
sub-conscious mind that always does the work, even when you think it is
the conscious mind. All the conscious mind does is to hold the attention
firmly upon the object before it, and then let the sub-consciousness
pass the material before it. But this holding the attention is tiresome
work, and it is not necessary for it to expend its energies upon the
details of the task, for the work may be done in an easier and simpler
way.

The best way is to follow a plan similar to the one mentioned a few
pages back. That is, to fix the interested attention firmly upon the
question before you, until you manage to get a clear, vivid impression
of *just what you want answered*. Then pass the whole matter into the
sub-conscious mind with the command "Attend to this," and then leave it.
Throw the whole matter off of your mind, and let the sub-conscious work
go on. If possible let the matter run along until the next morning and
then take it up for consideration, when, if you have proceeded properly
you will find the matter worked out, arranged in logical sequence, so
that your conscious attention will be able to clearly review the string
of facts, examples, illustrations, experiences, etc., relating to the
matter in question.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

Now, many of you will say that you would like this plan to work in cases
in which you have not the time to sleep over it. In such cases we will
say that it is possible to cultivate a rapid method of sub-consciousing,
and in fact many business men and men of affairs have stumbled upon a
similar plan, driven to the discovery by necessity. They will give a
quick, comprehensive, strong flash of attention upon the subject,
getting right to the heart of it, and then will let it rest in the
sub-conscious mind for a moment or two, killing a minute or two of time
in "preliminary conversation," until the first flash of answer comes to
them. After the first flash, and taking hold of the first loose end of
the subject that presents itself to them, they will unwind a string of
information and "talk" about the subject that will surprise even
themselves. Many lawyers have acquired this knowledge, and are what is
known as "resourceful." Such men are often confronted with questions of
conditions utterly unsuspected by them a moment before. Practice has
taught them the folly of fear and loss of confidence at such moments,
and has also impressed upon them the truth that something within them
will come to the rescue. So, presenting a confident air, they will
manage to say a few platitudes or commonplaces, while the sub-conscious
mind is most rapidly gathering its materials for the answer. In a moment
an opening thought "flashes upon" the man, and as he continues idea
after idea passes before his conscious and eager attention, sometimes so
rapidly that it is

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

almost impossible to utter them and lo! the danger is over, and a
brilliant success is often snatched from the jaws of an apparent failure
and defeat. In such cases the mental demand upon the sub-conscious mind
is not voiced in words, but is the result of a strong mental need.
However, if one gives a quick verbal command "*Attend to this*," the
result will be heightened.

We have known of cases of men prominent in the world's affairs who made
a practice of smoking a cigar during important business interviews, not
because they particularly cared for tobacco, but because they had
learned to appreciate the value of a moment's time for the mind to
"gather itself together," as one man expressed it. A question would be
asked, or a proposition advanced suddenly, demanding an immediate
answer. Under the watchful eyes of the other party the questioned party
tried not to show by his expression any indication of searching for an
answer, for obvious reasons. So, instead, he would take a long puff at
the cigar, then a slow attentive look at the ashes on its tip, and then
another moment consumed in flicking the ash into the receptacle, and
then came the answer, slowly, "Well, as to that—" or some other words of
that kind, prefacing the real answer which had been rapidly framed by
the sub-conscious mind in time to be uttered in its proper place. The
few moments of time gained had been sufficient for the sub-conscious
mind to gather up its materials, and the matter to be shaped properly,

without any appearance of hesitation on the part of the answerer. All of
this required practice, of course, but the principle may be seen through
it all, and in every similar case. The point is that the man, in such
cases, sets some hidden part of his mind to work for him, and when he
begins to speak the matter is at least roughly "licked into shape for
him."

Our students will understand, of course, that this is not advice to
smoke cigars during interviews of importance, but is merely given to
illustrate the principle. We have known other men to twirl a lead pencil
in their fingers in a lazy sort of fashion, and then drop it at the
important moment. But we must cease giving examples of this kind, lest
we be accused of giving instructions in worldly wisdom, instead of
teaching the use of the mind. The impressive pause of the teacher,
before answering his pupil's question, is also an example of the
workings of this law. One often says "stop, let me think a moment," and
during his pause he does not really consciously think at all, but stares
ahead in a dreamy fashion, while his subconscious mind does the work for
him, although he little suspects the nature of the operation. One has
but to look around him to realize the importance and frequent
application of this truth.

And not only may the sub-conscious mind be used in the directions
indicated on preceding pages, but in nearly every perplexity and problem
of life may it be called upon for help. These little sub-conscious

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

brownies are ever at our disposal, and seem to be happy to be of service
to us.

And so far from being apt to get us in a position of false dependence,
it is calculated to make us self-confident—for we are calling upon a
part of *ourselves*, not upon some outside intelligence. If those people
who never feel satisfied unless they are getting "advice" from others
would only cultivate the acquaintance of this little "home adviser"
within them, they would lose that dependent attitude and frame of mind,
and would grow self-confident and fearless. Just imagine the confidence
of one who feels that he has within him a source of knowledge equal to
that of the majority of those with whom he is likely to come in contact,
and he feels less afraid to face them, and

look them fearlessly in the eyes. He feels that his "mind" is not
confined to the little field of consciousness, but is an area infinitely
greater, containing a mass of information undreamed of. Everything that
the man has inherited, or brought with him from past lives—everything
that he has read, heard or seen, or experienced in this life, is hidden
away there in some quarter of that great sub-conscious mind, and, if he
will but give the command, the "essence" of all that knowledge is his.
The details may not be presented to his consciousness (often it is not,
for very good occult reasons) by the result, or essence of the knowledge
will pass before his attention, with sufficient examples and
illustrations, or arguments to enable him to make out "a good case" for
himself.

In the next lesson we will call your attention to other features and
qualities of this great field of mind, showing you how you can put it to
work, and Master it. Remember, always, the "I" is the Master. And its
Mastery must always be remembered and asserted over all phases and
planes of the mind. Do not be a slave to the sub-conscious, but be its
MASTER.

# MANTRAM (OR AFFIRMATION).

I have within me a great area of Mind that is under my command, and
subject to my Mastery. This Mind is friendly to me, and is glad to do my
bidding, and obey my orders. It will work for me when I ask it, and is
constant, untiring, and faithful. Knowing this I am no longer afraid,
ignorant or uninformed. The "I" is master of it all, and is asserting
its authority. "I" am master over Body, Mind, Consciousness, and
Sub-consciousness. I am "I"—a Centre of Power, Strength, and Knowledge.
I am "I"—and "I" any Spirit, a fragment from the Divine Flame.
