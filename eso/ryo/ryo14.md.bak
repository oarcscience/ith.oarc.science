### THE TWELFTH LESSON.

#### SUB-CONSCIOUS INFLUENCES.

In this lesson we wish to touch upon a certain feature of sub-conscious
mentation that has been much dwelt upon by certain schools of western
writers and students during the past twenty years, but which has also
been misunderstood, and, alas, too often misused, by some of those who
have been attracted to the subject. We allude to what has been called
the "Power of Thought." While this power is very real, and like any
other of the forces of nature may he properly used and applied in our
every day life, still many students of the power of the Mind have
misused it and have stooped to practices worthy only of the followers of
the schools of "Black Magic." We hear on all sides of the use of
"treatments" for selfish and often base ends, those following these
practices seeming to be in utter ignorance of the occult laws brought
into operation, and the terrible reaction inevitably falling to the lot
of those practicing this negative form of mental influence. We have been
amazed at the prevailing ignorance concerning the nature and effects of
this improper use of mental force, and at the same time, at the common
custom of such selfish, improper uses. This, more particularly, when the
true occultist knows that these things are not necessary, even to those
who seek "Success" by mental forces. There is a true method of the use
of mental forces, as well as an improper

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

use, and we trust that in this lesson we may be able to bring the matter
sharply and clearly before the minds of our students.

In our first course (The Fourteen Lessons) in the several lessons
entitled, respectively, "Thought Dynamics," "Telepathy, etc.," and
"Psychic Influence," we have given a general idea of the effect of one
mind upon other minds, and many other writers have called the attention
of the Western world to the same facts. There has been a general
awakening of interest in this phase of the subject among the Western
people of late years, and many and wonderful are the theories that have
been advanced among the conflicting schools regarding the matter. But,
notwithstanding the conflicting theories, there is a general agreement
upon the fundamental facts. They all agree that the mental forces may he
used to affect oneself and others, and many have started in to use these
mental forces for their own selfish ends and purposes, believing that
they were fully justified in so doing, and being unaware of the web of
psychic causes and effects which they were weaving around them by their
practices.

Now, at the beginning, let us impress upon the minds of our students the
fact that while it is undoubtedly true that people who are unaware of
the true sources of strength within them, may be, and often are affected
by mental force exerted by others, it is equally true that no one can be
adversely affected in this way providing he realizes the "I" within

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

himself, which is the only Real part of him, and which is an impregnable
tower of strength against the assaults of others. There is no cause for
all of this fear that is being manifested by many Western students of
thought-power, who are in constant dread Of being "treated" adversely by
other people. The man or woman who realizes the "I" within, may by the
slightest exercise of the Will surround himself with a mental aura which
will repel adverse thought-waves emanating from the minds of others.
Nay, more than this—the habitual recognition of the "I," and a few
moments’ meditation upon it each day, will of itself erect such an aura,
and will charge this aura with a vitality that will turn back adverse
thought, and cause it to return to the source from which it came, where
it will serve the good purpose of bringing to the mistaken mind
originating it, the conviction that such practices are hurtful and to be
avoided.

This realization of the "I," which we brought out in the first few
lessons of the present series, is the best and only real method of
self-protection. This may be easily understood, when we remind you that
the whole phenomena of mental influencing belongs to the "illusion" side
of existence—the negative side—and that the Real and Positive side must
of necessity be stronger. Nothing can affect the Real in you—and the
nearer you get to the Real, in realization and understanding, the
stronger do you become. *This is the whole secret*. Think it over.

But, there are comparatively few people who are

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

able to rest firmly in the "I" consciousness all the time, and the
others demand help while they are growing. To such, we would say "Creep
as close the Realization of the I, as possible, and rest your spiritual
feet firmly upon the rock of the Real Self." If you feel that people,
circumstances, or things are influencing you unduly, stand up boldly,
and deny the influence. Say something like this, "I DENY the power or
influence of persons, circumstances, or things to adversely affect me. I
ASSERT my Reality, Power and Dominion over these things." These words
may seem very simple, but when uttered with the consciousness of the
Truth underlying them, they become as a mighty force. You will
understand, of course, that there is no magic or virtue in the words
themselves—that is, in the grouping of the letters forming the words, or
the sounds of the words—the virtue resting in the *idea* of which the
words are the expression. You will be surprised at the effect of this
STATEMENT upon depressing, or adverse influences surrounding you. If
you—*you* who are reading these words now—feel yourself subject to any
adverse or depressing influences, will then stand up erect, throwing
your shoulders back, raising your head, and looking boldly and
fearlessly ahead, and repeat these words firmly, and with faith, you
will feel the adverse influences disappearing. You will almost see the
cloud falling back from you. Try it now, before reading further, and you
will become conscious of a new strength and power.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

You are perfectly justified in thus denying adverse influence. You have
a perfect right to drive back threatening or depressing thought-clouds.
You have a perfect right to take your stand upon the Rock of Truth—your
Real Self–and demand your Freedom. These negative thoughts of the world
in general, and of some people in particular, belong to the dark side of
life, and you have a right to demand freedom from them. You do not
belong to the same side of life, and it is your privilege—yes, your
duty—to repel them and bid them disappear from your horizon. You are a
Child of Light, and it is your right and duty to assert your freedom
from the things of darkness You are merely asserting the Truth when you
affirm your superiority and dominion over these dark forces. And in the
measure of your Recognition and Faith. will be the power at your
disposal. Faith and Recognition renders man a god. If we could but fully
recognize and realize just what we are, we could rise above this entire
plane of negative, dark world of thought. But we have become so blinded
and stupefied with the race-thought of fear and weakness, and so
hypnotized with the suggestions of weakness that we hear on all sides of
us, that even the best of us find it hard to avoid occasionally sinking
back into the lower depths of despair and discouragement. But, let us
remember this, brothers and sisters, that these periods of
"back-sliding" become less frequent, and last a shorter time, as we
proceed. Bye-and-bye we shall escape them altogether.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

Some may think that we are laying too much stress upon the negative side
of the question, but we feel that what we have said is timely, and much
needed by many who read these lessons. There has been so much said
regarding this negative, adverse power of thought, that it is well that
all should be taught that it is in their power to rise above this
thing—that the weapon for its defeat is already in their hand.

The most advanced student may occasionally forget that he is superior to
the adverse influence of the race-thought, and other clouds of thought
influence that happen to be in his neighborhood. When we think of how
few there are who are sending forth the positive, hopeful,
thought-waves, and how many are sending forth continually the thoughts
of discouragement, fear, and despair, it is no wonder that at times
there comes to us a feeling of discouragement, helplessness, and "what's
the use." But we must be ever alert, to stand up and deny these things
out of existence so far as our personal thought world is concerned.
There is a wonderful occult truth in the last sentence. We are the
makers, preservers, and destroyers of our personal thought-world. We may
bring into it that which we desire to appear; we may keep there what we
wish, cultivating, developing and unfolding the thought-forms that we
desire; we may destroy that which we wish to keep out. The "I" is the
master of its thought-world. Think over this great truth, O student!' By
Desire we call into existence—by affirmation we preserve and
encourage—by Denial we destroy. The

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

Hindus in their popular religious conceptions picture the One Being as a
Trinity, composed of Brahma, the Creator; Vishnu, the Preserver, and
Siva, the Destroyer—not three gods, as is commonly supposed, but a
Trinity composed of three aspects of Deity or Being. This idea of the
threefold Being is also applicable to the Individual—"as above so
below." The "I'" is the Being of the Individual, and the thought-world
is its manifestation. It creates, preserves, and destroys—as it Will.
Carry this idea with you, and realize that your individual thought-world
is your own field of manifestation. In it you are constantly
creating—constantly preserving—constantly destroying. And if you can
destroy anything in your own thought-world you remove it from its field
of activity, so far as you are concerned. And if you create anything in
your own thought-world, you bring it into active being, so far as you
are concerned. And if you preserve anything, you keep it by you in
effect and full operation and influence in your life. This truth belongs
to the higher phases of the subject, for its explanation is inextricably
bound up in the explanation of the "Thing-in-Itself"—the Absolute and
Its Manifestations. But even what we have said above, should give to the
alert student sufficient notice to cause hint to grasp the facts of the
case, and to apply the principles in his own life.

If one lives on the plane of the race-thought, he is subject to its
laws, for the law of cause and effect is in full operation on each plane
of life. But when,

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

one raises himself above the race-thought, and on to the plane of the
Recognition of the Real Self—The "I"—then does he extricate himself from
the lower laws of cause and effect, and places himself on a higher plane
of causation, in which he plays a much higher part. And so we are
constantly reminding you that your tower of strength and refuge lies on
the higher plane. But, nevertheless, we must deal with the things and
laws of the lower plane, because very few who read these lessons are
able to rest entirely upon the higher plane. The great majority of them
have done no more than to lift themselves partially on to the higher
plane, and they are consequently living on both planes, partly in each,
the consequence being that there is a struggle between the conflicting
laws of the two planes. The present stage is one of the hardest on the
Path of Attainment, and resembles the birth-pains of the physical body.
But you are being born into a higher plane, and the pain after becoming
the most acute will begin to ease, and in the end will disappear, and
then will come peace and calm. When the pain becomes the most acute,
then be cheered with the certainty that you have reached the crisis of
your new spiritual birth, and that you will soon gain peace. And then
you will see that the peace and bliss will be worth all the pain and
struggle. Be brave, fellow followers of The Path—Deliverance is nigh.
Soon will come the Silence that follows,-the Storm. The pain that you
are experiencing—ah, well do we know that you are experiencing the
path—is

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

not punishment, but is a necessary part of your growth. All Life follows
this plan—the pains of labor and birth ever precede the Deliverance.
Such is Life—and Life is based upon Truth—and all is well with the
world. We did not intend to speak of these things in this lesson, but as
we write there comes to us a great cry for help and a word of
encouragement and hope, from the Class which is taking this course of
lessons, and we feel bound to respond as we have done. Peace be with
you—one and all.

And, now we will begin our consideration of the laws governing what we
have called "Sub-conscious Influence."

All students of the Occult are aware of the fact that men may be, and
are, largely influenced by the thoughts of others. Not only is this the
case in instances where thoughts are directed from the mind of one
person to the mind of another, but also when there is no special
direction or intention in the thought sent forth. The vibrations of
thoughts linger in the astral atmosphere long after the effort that sent
forth the thought has passed. The astral atmosphere is charged with the
vibrations of thinkers of many years past, and still possesses
sufficient vitality to affect those whose minds are ready to receive
them at this time. And we all attract to us thought vibrations
corresponding in nature with those which we are in the habit of
entertaining. The Law of Attraction is in full operation, and one who
makes a study of the subject may see instances of it on all sides.

We invite to ourselves these thought vibrations by

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

maintaining and entertaining thoughts along certain lines. If we
cultivate a habit of thinking along the lines of Cheerfulness,
Brightness and Optimism, we attract to ourselves similar thought
vibrations of others and we will find that before long we will find all
sorts of cheerful thoughts pouring into our minds from all directions.
And, likewise, if we harbor thoughts of Gloom, Despair, Pessimism, we
lay ourselves open to the influx of similar thoughts which have emanated
from the minds of others. Thoughts of Anger, Hate, or Jealousy attract
similar thoughts which serve to feed the flame and keep alive the fire
of these low emotions. Thoughts of Love tend to draw to ourselves the
loving thoughts of others which tend to fill us with a glow of loving
emotion.

And not only are we affected in this way by the thoughts of others, but
what is known as "Suggestion" also plays an important part in this
matter of sub-conscious influence. We find that the mind has a tendency
to reproduce the emotions, moods, shades, of thought, and feelings of
other persons, as evidenced by their attitude, appearance, facial
expression, or words. If we associate with persons of gloomy
temperament, we run the risk of "catching" their mental trouble by the
law of suggestion, unless we understand this law and counteract it. In
the same way we find that cheerfulness is contagious, and if we keep in
the company of cheerful people we are very apt to take on their mental
quality. The same rule applies to frequenting the company of
unsuccessful

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

or successful people, as the case may be. If we allow ourselves to take
up the suggestions constantly emanating from them, we will find that our
minds will begin to reproduce the tones, attitudes, characteristics,
dispositions and traits of the other persons, and before long we will be
living on the same mental plane. As we have repeatedly said, these
things are true only when we allow ourselves to "take on" the
impressions, but unless one has mastered the law of suggestion, and
understands its principles and operations he is more or less apt to be
affected by it. All of you readily recall the effect of certain persons
upon others with whom they come in contact. One has a faculty of
inspiring with vigor and energy those in whose company he happens to be.
Another depresses those around him, and is avoided as a "human
wet-blanket." Another will cause a feeling of uneasiness in those around
him, by reason of his prevailing attitude of distrust, suspicion, and
low cunning. Some carry an atmosphere of health around them, while
others [seem to](errata.htm#11.md) be surrounded with sickly aura of
disease, even when their physical condition does not seem to indicate
the lack of health. Mental states have a subtle way of impressing
themselves upon us, and the student who will take the trouble to closely
observe those with whom he comes in contact will receive a liberal
education along these lines.

There is of course a great difference in the degree of suggestibility
among different persons. There are those who are almost immune, while at
the other

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

end of the line are to be found others who are so constantly and
strongly impressed by the suggestions of others, conscious or
unconscious, that they may be said to scarcely have any independent
thought or will of their own. But nearly all persons are suggestible to
a greater or lesser degree.

It must not be supposed from what we have said that all suggestions are
"bad," harmful, or undesirable. Many suggestions are very good for us,
and coming at the right time have aided us much. But, nevertheless, it
is well to always *let your own mind pass upon* these suggestions,
before allowing them to manifest in your sub-conscious mind. Let the
final decision be your own—and not the will of another—although you may
have considered outside suggestions in connection with the matter.

Remember always that YOU are an Individual, having a mind and Will of
your own. Rest firmly upon the base of your "I" consciousness, and you
will find yourself able to manifest a wonderful strength against the
adverse suggestions of others. Be your own Suggestor—train and influence
your sub-conscious mind Yourself, and do not allow it to be tampered
with by the suggestions of others. Grow the sense of Individuality.

There has been much written of recent years in the Western world
regarding the effect of the Mental Attitude upon Success and attainment
upon the material plane. While much of this is nothing but the wildest
imagining, still there remains a very firm and solid substratum of truth
underlying it all.

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

It is undoubtedly true that one's prevailing mental attitude is
constantly manifesting and objectifying itself in his life. Things,
circumstances, people, plans, all seem to fit into the general ideal of
the strong mental attitude of a man. And this from the operation of
mental law along a number of lines of action.

In the first place, the mind when directed toward a certain set of
objects becomes very alert to discover things concerning those
objects—to seize upon things, opportunities, persons, ideas, and facts
tending to promote the objects thought of. The man who is looking for
facts to prove certain theories, invariably finds them, and is also
quite likely to overlook facts tending to disprove his theory. The
Optimist and the Pessimist passing along the same streets, each sees
thousands of examples tending to fit in with his idea. As Kay says:
"When one is engaged in seeking for a thing, if he keep the image of it
clearly before the mind, he will be very likely to find it, and that
too, probably, where it would otherwise have escaped his notice. So when
one is engaged in thinking on a subject, thoughts of things resembling
it, or bearing upon it, and tending to illustrate it, come up on every
side. Truly, we may well say of the mind, as has been said of the eye,
that 'it perceives only what it brings within the power of perceiving.'"
John Burroughs has well said regarding this that "No one ever found the
walking fern who did not have the walking fern in his mind. A person
whose eye is full of Indian relics picks them up in every field he

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

walks through. They are quickly recognized because the eye has been
commissioned to find them."

While the mind is kept firmly fixed upon some ideal or aim, its whole
and varied powers are bent toward the realization and manifestation of
that ideal. In thousands of ways the mind will operate to objectify the
subjective mental attitude, a great proportion of the mental effort
being accomplished along sub-conscious lines. It is of the greatest
importance to one who wishes to succeed in any undertaking, to keep
before his mind's eye a clear mental image of that which he desires. He
should picture the thing desired, and himself as securing it, until it
becomes almost real. In this way be calls to his aid his entire mental
force and power, along the sub-conscious lines, and, as it were, makes a
clear path over which he may walk to accomplishment. Bain says regarding
this: "By aiming at a new construction, we must clearly conceive what is
aimed at. Where we have a very distinct and intelligible model before
us, we are in a fair way to succeed; proportion as the ideal is dim and
wavering, we stagger or miscarry." Maudsley says: "We cannot do an act
voluntarily unless we know what we are going to do, and we cannot know
exactly what we are going to do until we have taught ourselves to do
it." Carpenter says: "The continued concentration of attention upon a
certain idea gives it a dominant power, not only over the mind, but over
the body." [Müller](errata.htm#12.md) says "The idea of our own strength
gives strength to our movements. A person

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

who is confident of effecting anything by muscular efforts will do it
more easily than one not so confident of his own power." Tanner says:
"To believe firmly is almost tantamount in the end to accomplishment.
Extraordinary instances are related showing the influence of the will
over even the involuntary muscles."

Along the same lines, many Western Writers have added their testimony to
the Yogi principle of the manifestation of thought into action. Kay has
written: "A clear and accurate idea of what we wish to do, and how it is
to be effected, is of the utmost value and importance in all the affairs
of life. A man's conduct naturally shapes itself according to the ideas
in his mind, and nothing contributes more to success in life than having
a high ideal and keeping it constantly in view. Where such is the case
one can hardly fail in attaining it. Numerous unexpected circumstances
will be found to conspire to bring it about, and even what seemed at
first to be hostile may be converted into means for its furtherance;
while by having it constantly before the mind he will be ever ready to
take advantage of any favoring circumstances that may present
themselves." Along the same lines, Foster has written these remarkable
words: "It is wonderful how even the casualties of life seem to bow to a
spirit that will not bow to them, and yield to sub-serve a design which
they may, in their first apparent tendency threaten to frustrate. When a
firm, decisive spirit is recognized it is curious to see how the space
clears around a man and leaves him room and freedom."

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Simpson has said:
"A passionate desire and an unwearied will can perform impossibilities,
or what seem to be such to the cold and feeble." And Maudsley gives to
aspiring youth a great truth, when he says: "Thus it is that aspirations
are often prophecies, the [harbingers](errata.htm#13.md) of what a man
shall be in a condition to perform." And we may conclude the paragraph
by quoting Lytton: "Dream, O youth, dream manfully and nobly, and thy
dreams shall be prophets."

This principle of the power of the Mental Image is strongly impressed
upon the mind of the *chela*, or student, by the Yogi teachers. The
student is taught that just as the house is erected in accordance with
the plan of the architect, so is one's life built in accordance with the
prevailing Mental Image. The mind sub-consciously moulds itself around
the prevailing mental image or attitude, and then proceeds to draw upon
the outer world for material with which to build in accordance with the
plan. Not only is one's character built in this way, but the
circumstances and incidents of his life follow the same rule. The Yogi
student is instructed into the mysteries of the power of the mind in
this direction, not that he may make use of it to build up material
success, or to realize his personal desires—for he is taught to avoid
these things—but he is fully instructed, nevertheless, that he may
understand the workings of the law around him. And it is a fact well
known to close students of the occult, that the few who have attained
extraordinarily high degrees of development, make use of this power in

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

order to help the race. Many a world movement has been directed by the
mind, or minds, of some of these advanced souls who were able to see the
ideal of evolution ahead of the race, and by visualizing the same, and
concentrating upon it in meditation, actually hastened the progress of
the evolutionary wave, and caused to actually manifest that which they
saw, and upon which they had meditated.

It is true that some occultists have used similar plans to further their
own selfish personal ends—often without fully realizing just what power
they were employing—but this merely illustrates the old fact that the
forces of Nature may be used rightly and wrongly. And it is all the more
reason why those who are desirous of advancing the race—of assisting in
the evolution of the world—should make use of this mighty power in their
work. Success is not reprehensible, notwithstanding the fact that many
have interpreted and applied the word in such a matter as to make it
appear as if it had no other meaning or application other than the
crude, material selfish one generally attributed to it, by reason of its
misuse. The Western world is playing its part in the evolution of the
race, and its keynote is "Accomplishment." Those who have advanced so
high that they are able to view the world of men, as one sees a valley
from a mountain peak, recognize what this strenuous Western life means.
They see mighty forces in operation,—mighty principles being worked out
by those who little dream of the ultimate significance of that which
they are doing.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

Mighty things are before the Western world to-day—wonderful changes are
going on—great things are in the womb of time, and the hour of birth
draws near. The men and women in the Western world feel within them the
mighty urge to "accomplish" something—to take an active part in the
great drama of life. And they are right in giving full expression to
this urge, and are doing well in using every legitimate means in the
line of expression. And this idea of the Mental Attitude, or the Mental
Image, is one of the greatest factors in this striving for Success.

In this lesson we do not purpose giving "Success Talks" for our
students. These lessons are intended to fill another field, and there
are many other channels of information along the lines named. What we
wish to do is to point out to our students the meaning of all this
strenuous striving of the age, in the Western world, and the leading
principle employed therein. The great achievements of the material world
are being accomplished by means of the Power of the Mind. Men are
beginning to understand that "Thought manifests itself in Action," and
that Thought attracts to itself the things, persons and circumstances in
harmony with itself. The Power of Mind is becoming manifest in hundreds
of ways. The power of Desire, backed by Faith and Will, is beginning to
be recognized as one of the greatest of known dynamic forces. The life
of the race is entering into a new and strange stage of development and
evolution, and in the years to come MIND will

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

be seen, more clearly and still more clearly, to be the great principle
underlying the world of material things and happenings. That "All is
Mind" is more than a dreamy, metaphysical utterance, is being recognized
by the leaders in the world's thought.

As we have said, great changes are before the world and the race, and
every year brings us nearer to the beginning of them. In fact, the
beginning is already upon us. Let any thinker stop and reflect over the
wonderful changes of the past six years—since the dawning of the
Twentieth Century, and he will be dull indeed if he sees not the trend
of affairs. We are entering into a new Great Cycle of the race, and the
old is being prepared for being dropped off like an old worn out husk.
Old conventions, ideals, customs, laws, ethics, and things sociological,
economical, theological, philosophical, and metaphysical have been
outgrown, and are about to be "shed" by the race. The great cauldron of
human thought is bubbling away fiercely, and many things are rising to
its surface. Like all great changes, the good will come only with much
pain—all birth is with pain. The race feels the pain and perpetual
unrest, but knows not what is the disease nor the remedy. Many false
cases of diagnosis and prescription are even now noticeable, and will
become still more in evidence as the years roll by. Many self-styled
saviours of the race—prescribers for the pain of the soul and mind—will
arise and fall. But out of it all will come that for which the race now
waits.

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

The changes that are before us are as great as the changes in thought
and life described in the late novel by H. G. Wells, entitled "*In the
Days of the Comet*." In fact, Mr. Wells has indicated in that story some
of the very changes that the advanced souls of the race have informed
their students are before the race—the prophetic insight of the writer
named seems marvelous, until one realizes that even that writer is being
used as a part of the mental machinery of The Change itself. But the
change will not come about by reason of the new gas caused by the
brushing of the earth's surface by a passing comet. It will come from
the unfolding of the race mind, the process being now under way. Are not
the signs of mental unrest and discomfort becoming more and more
apparent as the days go by? The pain is growing greater, and the race is
beginning to fret and chafe, and moan. It knows not what it wants, but
it knows that it feels pain and wants something to relieve that pain.
The old things are beginning to totter and fall, and ideas rendered
sacred by years of observance are being brushed aside with a startling
display of irreverence. Under the surface of our civilization we may
hear the straining and groaning of the ideas and principles that are
striving to force their way out on to the plane of manifestation.

Men are running hither and thither crying for a leader and a savior.
They are trying this thing, and that thing, but they find not that which
they seek. They cry for Satisfaction, but it eludes them.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

And yet all this search and disappointment is part of the Great Change,
and is preparing the race for That-which-must-Come. And yet the relief
will not come from any Thing or Things. It will come from Within. Just
as when, in Well's story, things righted themselves when the vapor of
the comet had cleared men's minds, so will Things take their new places
when the mind of the race becomes cleared by the new unfold-ment that is
even now under way. Men are beginning to feel each other's pains—they
find themselves unsatisfied by the old rule of "every man for himself,
and the devil take the hindmost"—it used to content the successful, but
now it doesn't seem to be so satisfying. The man on top is becoming
lonesome, and dissatisfied, and discontented—his success seems to appall
him, in some mysterious manner. And the man underneath feels stirring
within himself strange longings and desires, and dissatisfaction. And
new frictions are arising, and new and startling ideas are being
suddenly advanced, supported and opposed.

And the relations between people seem to be unsatisfactory. The old
rules, laws, and bonds are proving irksome. New, strange, and wild
thoughts are coming into the minds of people, which they dare not utter
to their friends—and yet these same friends are finding similar ideas
within themselves. And somehow, underneath it all is to be found a
certain Honesty—yes, there is where the trouble seems to come, *the
world is tiring of hypocrisy and dishonesty in all human relations*, and
is crying aloud to be led back,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

someway, to Truth and Honesty in Thought and Action. But it does not see
the way out! And it will not see the way out, until the race-mind
unfolds still further. And the pain of the new unfoldment is stirring
the race to its depths. From the deep recesses of the race-mind are
rising to the surface old passions, relics from the cave-dweller days,
and all sorts of ugly mental relics of the past. And they will continue
to rise and show themselves until at last the bubbling pot will begin to
quiet down, and then will come a new peace, and the best will come to
the surface—the essence of all the experiences of the race.

To our students, we would say: During the struggle ahead of the race,
play well your part, doing the best you can, living each day by itself,
meeting each new phase of life with confidence and courage. Be not
deluded by appearances, nor follow after strange prophets. Let the
evolutionary processes work themselves out, and do you fall in with the
wave without struggling, and without overmuch striving. The Law is
working itself out well—of that be assured. Those who have entered into
even a partial understanding and recognition of the One Life underlying,
will find that they will be as the chosen people during the changes that
are coming to the race. They have attained that which the race is
reaching toward in pain and travail. And the force behind the Law will
carry them along, for they will be the leaven that is to lighten the
great mass of the race in the new dispensation. Not by deed, or by
action, but by Thought, will these

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

people leaven the mass. The Thought is even now at work, and all who
read these words are playing a part in the work, although they may know
it not. If the race could realize this truth of the One Life underlying,
to-day, the Change would occur in a moment, but it will not come in that
way. When this understanding gradually dawns upon the race—this new
consciousness—then will Things take their proper places, and the Lion
and the Lamb lie down together in peace.

We have thought it well to say these things in this the last lesson of
this course. They are needed words—they will serve to point out the way
to those who are able to read. "*Watch and wait for the Silence that
will follow the Storm*."

In this series of lessons we have endeavored to give you a plain,
practical presentation of some of the more important features of "Raja
Yoga." But this phase of the subject, as important and interesting as it
is, is not the highest phase of the Great Yoga teachings. It is merely
the preparation of the soil of the mind for what comes afterward. The
phase called "Gnani Yoga"—the Yoga of Wisdom—is the highest of all the
various phases of Yoga, although each of the lower steps is important in
itself. We find ourselves approaching the phase of our work for which we
have long wished. Those who have advised and directed this work have
counseled us to deal with the less advanced and simpler phases, in order
to prepare the minds of those who might be interested, so that they

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

would be ready for the higher teachings. At times we have felt an
impatience for the coming of the day when we would be able to teach the
highest that has come to us. And now the time seems to have come.
Following this course, we will begin a series of lessons in "GNANI
YOGA"—the Yoga of Wisdom—in which we will pass on to our students the
highest teachings regarding the Reality and its Manifestations—the One
and the Many. The teachings that "All is Mind" will be explained in such
a manner as to be understood by all who have followed us so far. We will
be able to impart to you the higher truths about Spiritual Evolution,
sometimes called "Reincarnation," as well as Spiritual Cause and Effect,
often called "Karma." The highest truths about these important subjects
are often obscured by popular misconceptions occasioned by partial
teaching. We trust that you—our students—will wish to follow us still
higher—higher than we have ventured so far, and we assure you that there
is a Truth to be seen and known that is as much higher than the other
phases upon which we have touched, as those phases have been higher than
the current beliefs of the masses of the race. We trust that the Powers
of Knowledge may guide and direct us that we may be able to convey our
message so that it may be accepted and understood. We thank our students
who have traveled thus far with us, and we assure them that their loving
sympathy has ever been a help and an inspiration to us.

Peace be with you.
