Raja Yoga is about using techniques such as meditation, retention of
breath, and concentration to achieve the ultimate goal of absorption
into the cosmos. However, like most of the Yogi Publications books
written and published by William Walker Atkinson under a pseudonym, this
is basically a [New Thought](../../nth/index.md) tract. Apparently this was
originally a correspondence course in mental focus, which he repurposed
under one of his Hindu pseudonyms to fill in the Raja Yoga slot in the
YPS lineup.

The book, strangely, is titled 'Raja Yoga, or Mental Development' on the
[cover](img/cover.jpg.md), and 'A Series of Lessons in Raja Yoga' on the
[title page](img/title.jpg.md), another clue to the repackaging job. The
core of the book is a number of mental exercises and affirmations, only
peripherally related to traditional yogic practice. There are numerous
uncited quotes from western authors, but the only actual Hindu author he
quotes is [Edward Carpenter](../../lgbt/index.htm#modern.md), which doesn't
make a good case for an Indian hand at work here. As is typical in the
YPS books, there are long digressions on science, just as modern New
Thought proponents reference quantum physics. Atkinson does not mention
asanas (yogic postures) or breathing exercises, key techniques which are
used in Raja and other schools of Yoga. For more information on Raja
Yoga, refer to the chapter [Râja Yoga](../../hin/hby/hby06.md) in [How to
be a Yogi](../../hin/hby/index.md) of Swami Abhedânanda \[1902\], as well
as [Relax With Yoga](../../hin/rwy/index.md) by Arthur Liebers \[1960\],
which discusses modern western Raja Yoga.
