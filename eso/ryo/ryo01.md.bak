The lessons which compose this volume, originally appeared in the shape
of monthly lessons, the first of which was issued in October, 1905, and
the twelfth in September, 1906. These lessons met with a hearty and
generous response from the public, and the present volume is issued in
response to the demand for the lessons in a permanent and durable form.
There have been no changes made in the text.

The publishers take the liberty to call the attention of the reader to
the great amount of information condensed within the space given to each
lesson. Students have told us that they have found it necessary to read
and study each lesson carefully, in order to absorb the varied
information contained within its pages. They have also stated that they
have found it advisable to re-read the lessons several times, allowing
an interval between each reading and that at each re-reading they would
discover information that had escaped them during the course of the
previous study. This has been repeated to us so often that we feel
justified in mentioning it, that other readers might avail themselves of
the same course and plan of study.

Following his usual custom, the writer of the lessons has declined to
write a preface for this book, claiming that the lessons speak for
themselves, and that those for whom they are intended will receive the
message contained within them, without any prefatory talk.
