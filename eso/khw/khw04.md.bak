### *Preface to the Third Edition*

Herewith appear in book form my expositions originally published as
single essays under the title *Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its
Attainment*. For the present, this volume offers the first part; one
that is to follow will constitute the continuation. This work on a
development of man that will enable him to grasp the supersensible
worlds cannot be presented to the public in a new form without certain
comments which I shall now make. The communications it contains
concerning the development of the human soul are intended to fill
various needs.

First of all, something is to be offered those people who feel drawn to
the results of spiritual research, and who must raise the question:
“Well, whence do these persons derive their knowledge

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

who claim the ability to tell us something of the profound riddles of
life?”—Spiritual science does this. Whoever wishes to observe the facts
leading to such claims must rise to supersensible cognition. He must
follow the path I have endeavored to describe in this book. On the other
hand, it would be an error to imagine these disclosures of spiritual
science to be valueless for one who lacks the inclination or the
possibility to pursue this path himself. In order to establish the facts
through research, the ability to enter the supersensible worlds is
indispensable; but once they have been discovered and communicated, even
one who does not perceive them himself can be adequately convinced of
their truth. A large proportion of them can be tested offhand, simply by
applying ordinary common sense in a genuinely unprejudiced way. Only,
one must not let this open-mindedness become confused by any of the
pre-conceived ideas so common in human life. Someone can easily believe,
for example, that some statement or other contradicts certain facts
established by modern science. In reality, there is no such thing as a
scientific fact that contradicts spiritual science; but there can easily
seem to be contradictions unless

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

scientific conclusions are consulted abundantly and without prejudice.
The student will find that the more open-mindedly he compares spiritual
science with positive scientific achievements, the more clearly is
complete accord to be seen.

Another category of spiritual-scientific disclosures, it is true, will
be found to elude purely mental judgment more or less; but the right
relation to these also will be achieved without great difficulty by one
who understands that not the mind alone but healthy feeling as well is
qualified to determine what is true. And when this feeling does not
permit itself to be warped by a liking or antipathy for some opinion or
other, but really allows higher knowledge to act without prejudice, a
corresponding sentient judgment results.

And there are many more ways of confirming this knowledge for those who
cannot or do not wish to tread the path into the supersensible world.
Such people can feel very clearly what value this knowledge has in life,
even when it comes to them only through the communications of those
engaged in spiritual research. Not everyone can immediately achieve
spiritual vision; but the discoveries of those who have it can be
health-giving life-nourishment

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

for all. For everyone can apply them; and whoever does so will soon
discover what life in every branch can be with their aid, and what it
lacks without them. The results of supersensible knowledge, when
properly employed in life, prove to be—not unpractical, but rather,
practical in the highest sense.

One who does not himself intend to follow the path to higher knowledge,
but is interested in the facts it reveals, can ask: How does the seer
arrive at these facts? To such a one this book is intended to picture
the path in such a way that even one not following it can nevertheless
have confidence in the communications of the person who has done so.
Realizing how the spiritual scientist works, he can approve, and say to
himself: The impression made upon me by the description of this path to
higher worlds makes clear why the facts reported seem reasonable. Thus
this book is intended to help those who want their sense of truth and
feeling for truth concerning the supersensible world strengthened and
assured.

No less, however, does it aim to offer aid to those who themselves seek
the way to supersensible knowledge. The truth of what is here set

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

forth will best be verified by those who achieve its reality within
themselves. Anyone with this intention will do well to keep reminding
himself that in an exposition on the development of the soul, more is
called for than becoming acquainted with the substance, which is
frequently the aim in other expositions. It is necessary to familiarize
oneself intimately with the presentation. One must postulate the
following: no single matter is to be comprehended only by means of what
is said about the matter itself, but by means of much else that is
disclosed concerning totally different matters. This will develop the
conception that what is vital is to be found not in any single truth but
in the harmony of all truths. This must be seriously considered by
anyone intending to carry out the exercises. An exercise can be rightly
understood and even rightly executed, and yet produce a wrong effect
unless another be added to it—one that will resolve the one-sidedness of
the first into a harmony of the soul. Whoever reads this book in an
intimate way, so that the reading resembles an inner experience, will
not merely familiarize himself with its content: one passage will evoke
a certain feeling, another passage another feeling;

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

and in that way he will learn how much importance should be seen in the
one or the other in the development of his soul. He will also find out
in what form he should try this or that exercise, what form best suits
his particular individuality. When one has to do, as is the case here,
with descriptions of processes that are to be *experienced*, it is
necessary to refer again and again to the content; for it will become
manifest that much can be satisfactorily assimilated only after trial,
which in turn reveals certain finer points that at first are bound to be
overlooked.

Even those readers who do not intend to take the way prescribed will
find much in the book that can be of service to the inner life, such as
maxims, suggestions that throw light on various puzzling problems, and
so on.

And those who have had experiences in their lives that serve, to some
extent, as an initiation through life may derive a certain satisfaction
from finding clarified through co-ordination what had haunted them as
separate problems—things they already knew, but perhaps without having
been able to consolidate them in adequate conceptions.
