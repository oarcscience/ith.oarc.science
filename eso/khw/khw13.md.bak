### IX

### *THE GUARDIAN OF THE THRESHOLD*

THE important experiences marking the student's ascent into the higher
worlds include his meeting with the *Guardian of the Threshold*.
Strictly speaking, there are two *Guardians*: a *lesser* and a
*greater*. The student meets the lesser Guardian when the threads
connecting willing, feeling, and thinking within the finer astral and
etheric bodies begin to loosen, in the way described in the foregoing
chapter. The greater Guardian is encountered when this sundering of the
connections extends to the physical parts of the body, that is, at first
to the brain. The lesser Guardian is a sovereign being. He does not come
into existence, as far as the student is concerned, until the latter has
reached the requisite stage of

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

development. Only some of his most important characteristics can here be
indicated.

The attempt will now be made to describe in narrative form this meeting
with the lesser Guardian of the Threshold, as a result of which the
student learns that his thinking, feeling, and willing have become
released within him from their inherent connection.

A truly terrible spectral being confronts him, and he will need all the
presence of mind and faith in the security of his path which he has had
ample opportunity to acquire in the course of his previous training.

The Guardian proclaims his signification somewhat in the following
words: “Hitherto, powers invisible to thyself watched over thee. They
saw to it that in the course of thy lives each of thy good deeds brought
its reward, and each of thine evil deeds was attended by its evil
results. Thanks to their influence thy character formed itself out of
thy life-experiences and thy thoughts. They were the instruments of thy
destiny. They ordained that measure of joy and pain allotted to thee in
thine incarnations, according to thy conduct in lives gone by. They
ruled over thee as the all-embracing

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

law of *karma*. These powers will now partly release thee from their
constraining influence; and henceforth must thou accomplish for thyself
a part of the work which hitherto they performed for thee. Destiny
struck thee many a hard blow in the past. Thou knewest not why. Each
blow was the consequence of a harmful deed in a bygone lie. Thou
foundest joy and gladness, and thou didst take them as they came. They,
too, were the fruits of former deeds. Thy character shows many a
beautiful side, and many an ugly flaw. Thou hast thyself to thank for
both, for they are the result of thy previous experiences and thoughts.
These were till now unknown to thee; their effects alone were made
manifest. The karmic powers, however, beheld all thy deeds in former
lives, and all thy most secret thoughts and feelings, and determined
accordingly thy present self and thy present mode of life. But now all
the good and evil sides of thy bygone lives shall be revealed to thee.
Hitherto they were interwoven with thine own being; they were in thee
and thou couldst not see them, even as thou canst not behold thine own
brain with physical eyes. But now they become released from thee; they
detach themselves from thy personality.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They assume an
independent form which thou canst see even as thou beholdest the stones
and plants of the outer world. And . . . I am that very being who shaped
my body out of thy good and evil achievements. My spectral form is woven
out of thine own life's record. Till now thou hast borne me invisibly
within thee, and it was well that this was so; for the wisdom of thy
destiny, though concealed from thee, could thus work within thee, so
that the hideous stains on my form should be blotted out. Now that I
have come forth from within thee, that concealed wisdom, too, has
departed from thee. It will pay no further heed to thee; it will leave
the work in thy hands alone. I must become a perfect and glorious being,
or fall a prey to corruption; and should this occur, I would drag thee
also down with me into a dark and corrupt world. If thou wouldst avoid
this, then thine own wisdom must become great enough to undertake the
task of that other, concealed wisdom, which has departed from thee. As a
form visible to thyself I will never for an instant leave thy side, once
thou hast crossed my Threshold. And in future, whenever thou dost act or
think wrongly thou wilt straightway perceive thy guilt

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

as a hideous, demoniacal distortion of my form. Only when thou hast made
good all thy bygone wrongs and hast so purified thyself that all further
evil is, for thee, a thing impossible, only then will my being have
become transformed into radiant beauty. Then, too, shall I again become
united with thee for the welfare of thy future activity.

“Yet my Threshold is fashioned out of all the timidity that remains in
thee, out of all the dread of the strength needed to take full
responsibility for all thy thoughts and actions. As long as there
remains in thee a trace of fear of becoming thyself the guide of thine
own destiny, just so long will this Threshold lack what still remains to
be built into it. And as long as a single stone is found missing, just
so long must thou remain standing as though transfixed; or else stumble.
Seek not, then, to cross this Threshold until thou dost feel thyself
entirely free from fear and ready for the highest responsibility.
Hitherto I only emerged from thy personality when death recalled thee
from an earthly life; but even then my form was veiled from thee. Only
the powers of destiny who watched over thee beheld me and could thus, in
the intervals between death and a new birth, build

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

in thee, in accordance with my appearance, that power and capacity
thanks to which thou couldst labor in a new earth life at the
beautifying of my form, for thy welfare and progress. It was I, too,
whose imperfection ever and again constrained the powers of destiny to
lead thee back to a new incarnation upon earth. I was present at the
hour of thy death, and it was on my account that the Lords of Karma
ordained thy reincarnation. And it is only by thus unconsciously
transforming me to complete perfection in ever recurring earthly lives
that thou couldst have escaped the powers of death and passed over into
immortality united with me.

“Visible do I thus stand before thee today, just as I shave ever stood
invisible beside thee in the hour of death. When thou shalt have crossed
my Threshold, thou wilt enter those realms to which thou hast hitherto
only had access after physical death. Thou dost now enter them with full
knowledge, and henceforth as thou wanderest outwardly visible upon the
earth thou wilt at the same time wander in the kingdom of death, that
is, in the kingdom of life eternal. I am indeed the Angel of Death; but
I am at the same time the

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

bearer of a higher life without end. Through me thou wilt die with thy
body still living, to be reborn into an imperishable existence.

“Into this kingdom thou art now entering; thou wilt meet beings that are
supersensible, and happiness will be thy lot. But I myself must provide
thy first acquaintance with that world, and I am thine own creation.
Formerly I drew my life from thine; but now thou hast awakened me to a
separate existence so that I stand before thee as the visible gauge of
thy future deeds—perhaps, too, as thy constant reproach. Thou hast
formed me, but by so doing thou hast undertaken, as thy duty, to
transform me.”

(It will be gathered from the above that the Guardian of the Threshold
is an (astral) figure, revealing itself to the student's awakened higher
sight; and it is to this supersensible encounter that spiritual science
conducts him. It is a lower magical process to make the Guardian of the
Threshold physically visible also. That was attained by producing a
cloud of fine substance, a kind of frankincense resulting from a
particular mixture of a number of substances. The developed power of the
magician is then able to mould the frankincense

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

into shape, animating it with the still unredeemed karma of the
individual. Such physical phenomena are no longer necessary for those
sufficiently prepared for the higher sight; and besides this, anyone who
sees, without adequate preparation, his unredeemed karma appear before
his eyes as a living creature would run the risk of straying into evil
byways. Bulwer Lytton's *Zanoni* contains in novel form a description of
the Guardian of the Threshold.)

What is here indicated in narrative form must not be understood in the
sense of an allegory, but as an experience of the highest possible
reality befalling the esoteric student.

The Guardian must warn him not to go a step further unless he feels in
himself the strength to fulfill the demands made in the above speech.
However horrible the form assumed by the Guardian, it is only the effect
of the student's own past life, his own character risen out of him into
independent existence. This awakening is brought about by the separation
of will, thought, and feeling. To feel for the first time that one has
oneself called a spiritual being into existence is in itself an
experience of deepest significance. The student's

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

preparation must aim at enabling him to endure the terrible sight
without a trace of timidity and, at the moment of the meeting, to feel
his strength so increased that he can undertake fully conscious the
responsibility for transforming and beautifying the Guardian.

If successful, this meeting with the Guardian results in the student's
next physical death being an entirely different event from the death as
he knew it formerly. He experiences death consciously by laying aside
the physical body as one discards a garment that is worn out or perhaps
rendered useless through a sudden rent. Thus his physical death is of
special importance only for those living with him, whose perception is
still restricted to the world of the senses. For them the student dies;
but for himself nothing of importance is changed in his whole
environment. The entire supersensible world stood open to him before his
death, and it is this same world that now confronts him after death.

The Guardian of the Threshold is also connected with other matters. The
person belongs to a family, a nation, a race; his activity in this world
depends upon his belonging to some such

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

community. His individual character is also connected with it. The
conscious activity of individual persons by no means exhausts everything
to be reckoned with in a family, a nation, or a race. Besides their
character, families, nations, and races have also their destiny. For
persons restricted to their senses these things remain mere general
ideas; and the materialistic thinker, in his prejudice, will look down
with contempt on the spiritual scientist when he hears that for him,
family and national character, lineal or racial destiny, are vested in
beings just as real as the personality in which the character and
destiny of the individual man are vested. The spiritual scientist
becomes acquainted with higher worlds of which the separate
personalities are members, just as arms and legs are members of the
human being. Besides the separate individuals, a very real family and
national group soul and racial spirit is at work in the life of a
family, a people, or a race. Indeed, in a certain sense the separate
individuals are merely the executive organs of these family group souls,
racial spirits, and so on. It is nothing but the truth to say, for
instance, that a national group soul makes use of each individual man
belonging to that nation for the execution of some work. The

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

group soul of a people does not descend into physical reality but dwells
in the higher worlds and, in order to work in the physical world, makes
use of the physical organs of each individual human being. In a higher
sense, it is like an architect making use of workmen for executing the
details of a building. In the truest sense, everyone receives his
allotted task from his family, national, or racial group soul. Now, the
ordinary person is by no means initiated into the higher design of his
work. He joins unconsciously in the tasks of his people and of his race.
From the moment the student meets the Guardian, he must not only know
his own tasks, but must knowingly collaborate in those of his folk, his
race. Every extension of his horizon necessarily enlarges the scope of
his duties. What actually happens is that the student adds a new body to
his finer soul-body. He puts on a second garment. Hitherto he found his
way through the world with the coverings enveloping his personality; and
what he had to accomplish for his community, his nation, his race, was
directed by higher spirits who made use of his personality.

And now, a further revelation made to him by the Guardian of the
Threshold is that henceforth

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

these spirits will withdraw their guiding hand from him. He must step
out of the circle of his community. Yet as an isolated personality he
would become hardened in himself and decline into ruin, did he not,
himself, acquire those powers which are vested in the national and
racial spirits. Many, no doubt, will say: “Oh, I have entirely freed
myself from all lineal and racial connections; I only want to be a human
being and nothing but a human being.” To these one must reply: “Who,
then, brought you to this freedom? Was it not your family who placed you
in the world where you now stand? Have you not your lineage, your
nation, your race to thank for being what you are? They have brought you
up. And if now, exalted above all prejudices, you are one of the
light-bringers and benefactors of your stock and even of your race, it
is to their up-bringing that you owe it. Yes, even when you say you are
\`nothing but a human being,' even the fact that you have become such a
personality you owe to the spirits of your communities.” Only the
esoteric student learns what it means to be entirely cut off from his
family, national, or racial spirit. He alone realizes, through personal
experience, the insignificance of all such education in respect

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

of the life now confronting him. For everything inculcated by education
completely melts away when the threads binding will, thought, and
feeling are severed. He looks back on the result of all his previous
education as he might on a house crumbling away brick by brick, which he
must now rebuild in a new form. And again, it is more than a mere
symbolical expression to say that when the Guardian has enunciated his
first statement, there arises from the spot where he stands a whirlwind
which extinguishes all those spiritual lights that have hitherto
illumined the pathway of his life. Utter darkness, relieved only by the
rays issuing from the Guardian himself, unfolds before the student. And
out of this darkness resounds the Guardian's further admonition: “Step
not across my Threshold until thou dost clearly realize that thou wilt
thyself illumine the darkness ahead of thee; take not a single step
forward until thou art positive that thou hast sufficient oil in thine
own lamp. The lamps of the guides whom thou hast hitherto followed will
now no longer be available to thee.” At these words, the student must
turn and glance backward. The Guardian of the Threshold now draws aside
a veil which till now had concealed deep life-mysteries. The family,
national,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

and racial spirits are revealed to the student in their full activity,
so that he perceives clearly on the one hand, how he has hitherto been
led, and no less clearly on the other hand, that he will henceforward no
longer enjoy this guidance. That is the second warning received at the
Threshold from its Guardian.

Without preparation, no one could endure the sight of what has here been
indicated. But the higher training which makes it possible at all for
the student to advance up to the Threshold simultaneously puts him in a
position to find the necessary strength at the right moment. Indeed, the
training can be so harmonious in its nature that the entry into the
higher life is relieved of everything of an agitating or tumultuous
character. His experience at the Threshold will then be attended by a
premonition of that felicity which is to provide the keynote of his
newly awakened life. The feeling of a new freedom will outweigh all
other feelings; and attended by this feeling, his new duties and
responsibilities will appear as something which man, at a particular
stage of life, must needs take upon himself.
