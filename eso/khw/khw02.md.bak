### *Preface to the Edition of May 1918*

In working over this new edition I found only minor changes in its
substance necessary; but I have added an appendix in which I have
endeavored to explain more clearly the psychological foundations to
which the disclosures contained in the book must be traced if they are
to be accepted without risk of misunderstanding. I believe that the
contents of the appendix will also serve to show many an opponent of
anthroposophical spiritual science that his judgment is based upon a
misconception of the nature of this spiritual science; that he does not
see what it really is.

*Rudolph Steiner*
