### VIII

### *THE SPLITTING OF THE HUMAN PERSONALITY DURING SPIRITUAL TRAINING*

DURING sleep no impressions are conveyed to the human soul through the
instrumentality of the physical sense-organs. The impressions from the
ordinary outer world do not find their way to the soul when in that
condition. In certain respects the soul is actually outside the part of
the human being—the so-called physical body—which in waking life is the
medium for sense perceptions and thought. The soul is then only
connected with the finer bodies (the etheric body and the astral body),
which are beyond the scope of physical sense observation. But the
activity of these finer bodies does not cease during sleep. Just as the
physical body is connected and lives with the things and beings of the
physical world, affecting them and being affected by them,

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

so, too, does the soul live in a higher world; only, this life of the
soul continues also during sleep. The soul is in full activity during
sleep, but we can know nothing of this activity so long as we have no
spiritual organs of perception through which to observe what is going on
around us and see what we ourselves are doing during sleep, as we
observe our daily physical environment with our ordinary senses. The
preceding chapters have shown that esoteric training consists in the
development of such spiritual sense organs. Now if, as a result of
esoteric training, the student's life during sleep is transformed in the
manner described in the foregoing chapter, he will, when in that
condition, be able to follow consciously everything going on around him.
He can at will find his way in his environment as he could, when awake,
with his ordinary senses. It should here be noted that a higher degree
of clairvoyance is required for the higher perception of ordinary
physical environment. This was indicated in the last chapter. In the
initial stages of his development the student perceives things
pertaining to another world without being able to discern their
connection

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

with the objects of his daily physical environment.

These characteristics of life during sleep or in dreams illustrate what
is continually taking place in the human being. The soul lives in
uninterrupted activity in the higher worlds, even gathering from them
the impulse to act upon the physical body. Ordinarily unconscious of his
higher life, the esoteric student renders himself conscious of it, and
thereby his whole life becomes transformed. As long as the soul remains
unseeing in the higher sense it is guided by superior cosmic beings. And
just as the life of a person born blind is changed, through a successful
operation, from its previous dependence on a guide, so too is the life
of a person changed through esoteric training. He outgrows the principle
of being guided by a master and must henceforward undertake to be his
own guide. The moment this occurs he is, of course, liable to commit
errors totally unknown to ordinary consciousness. He acts now from a
world from which, formerly, higher powers unknown to him influenced him.
These higher powers are directed by the universal cosmic harmony.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The student
withdraws from this cosmic harmony, and must now himself accomplish
things which were hitherto done for him without his co-operation.

It is for this reason that so much is found in books dealing with these
matters concerning the dangers connected with the ascent into higher
worlds. The descriptions sometimes given of these dangers may well make
timid souls shudder at the prospect of this higher life. Yet the fact is
that dangers only arise when the necessary precautions are neglected. If
all the measures counseled by true esoteric science are adopted, the
ascent will indeed ensue through experiences surpassing in power and
magnitude everything the boldest flights of sense-bound fantasy can
picture; and yet there can be no question of injury to health or life.
The student meets with horrible powers threatening life at every turn
and from every side. It will even be possible for him to make use of
certain forces and beings existing beyond physical perception, and the
temptation is great to control these forces for the furtherance of
personal and forbidden interests, or to employ them wrongly out of a
deficient knowledge of the higher worlds. Some of

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

these especially important experiences, for instance, the meeting with
Guardian of the Threshold, will be described in the following chapters.
Yet we must realize that the hostile powers are none the less present,
even though we know nothing of them. It is true that in this case their
relation to man is ordained by higher power, and that this relation
alters when the human being consciously enters this world hitherto
concealed from him. But at the same time his own existence is enhanced
and the circle of his life enriched by a great and new field of
experience. A real danger can only arise if the student, through
impatience or arrogance, assumes too early a certain independence with
regard to the experiences of the higher worlds; if he cannot wait to
gain really sufficient insight into the supersensible laws. In these
spheres, modesty and humility are far less empty words than in ordinary
life. If the student possesses these qualities in the very best sense he
may be certain that his ascent into the higher life will be achieved
without danger to all that is commonly called health and life. Above all
things, no disharmony must ensue between the higher experiences and the
events and demands of every-day life. Man's task must be entirely

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

sought for on this earth, and anyone desiring to shirk his earthly task
and to escape into another world may be certain he will never reach his
goal. Yet what the senses perceive is only part of the world, and it is
in the spirit world that the beings dwell who express themselves in the
facts of the physical world. Man must become a partaker of the spirit in
order to carry its revelations into the physical world. He transforms
the earth by implanting in it what he has ascertained in the spiritual
world. That is his task. It is only because the physical world is
dependent upon the spiritual, and because man can work upon earth, in a
true sense, only if he is a participator in those worlds in which the
creative forces lie concealed—only for these reasons should he have the
desire to ascend to the higher worlds. No one approaching esoteric
training with these sentiments, and resolved not to deviate for a moment
from these prescribed directions, need fear the slightest danger. No one
should allow the prospect of these dangers to deter him from esoteric
training; it should rather act as a strong challenge to one and all to
acquire those faculties which every true esoteric student must possess.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

After these preliminary observations that should dispel any element of
terror, a description of some of the so-called dangers will be given. It
is true that great changes take place in the student's finer bodies, as
described above. These changes are connected with certain processes in
the development of the three fundamental forces of the soul, with
willing, feeling, and thinking. Before esoteric training, these forces
are subject to a connection ordained by higher cosmic laws. Man's
willing, feeling and thinking are not arbitrary. A particular idea
arising in the mind is attended by a particular feeling, according to
natural laws; or it is followed by a resolution of the will in equally
natural sequence. We enter a room, find it stuffy, and open the window.
We hear our name called and follow the call. We are questioned and we
answer. We perceive an ill-smelling object and experience a feeling of
disgust. These are simple connections between thinking, feeling, and
willing. When we survey human life we find that everything is built up
on such connections. Indeed, life is not termed normal unless such a
connection, founded on the laws of human nature, is observed between
thinking, feeling

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

and willing. It would be found contrary to these laws if the sight of an
ill-smelling object gave anyone pleasure, or if anyone, on being
questioned, did not answer. The success anticipated from a right
education or fitting instruction is based upon the presumption that a
connection between thinking, feeling, and willing, corresponding to
human nature, can be established in the pupil. Certain ideas are
conveyed to him on the assumption that they will be associated, in
regular fashion, with his feelings and volitions.

All this arises from the fact that in the finer soul-vehicles of man the
central points of the three forces—thinking, feeling and willing—are
connected with each other according to laws. This connection in the
finer soul organism has its counterpart in the coarser physical body. In
the latter, too, the organs of will are connected according to laws with
those of thinking and feeling. A particular thought, therefore,
inevitably evokes a feeling or an activity of will. In the course of
higher development, the threads interconnecting the three fundamental
forces are severed. At first this severance occurs only within the finer
soul organism, but at a still higher stage

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the separation extends also to the physical body. It is a fact that in
higher spiritual development the brain divides into three separate
parts. This separation is not physically perceptible in the ordinary
way, nor can it be demonstrated by the keenest instruments. Yet it
occurs, and the clairvoyant has means of observing it. The brain of the
higher clairvoyant divides into three independently active entities: The
thought-brain, the feeling-brain, and the will-brain.

Thus the organs of thinking, feeling, and willing become individualized;
their connection henceforth is not maintained by laws inherent in
themselves, but must be managed by the awakened higher consciousness of
the individual. This, then, is the change which the student observes
coming over him: that no connection arises of itself between an idea and
a feeling or a will-impulse, unless he himself provides one. No impulse
urges him from thought to action unless he himself in freedom give rise
to this impulse. He can henceforth confront, devoid of feeling, a fact
which before his training would have filled him with glowing love or
bitter hatred; and he can remain impassive at the thought which formerly

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

would have spurred him on to action, as though of its own accord. He can
perform actions through resolutions of the will for which there is not
the slightest reason for anyone not having undergone esoteric training.
The student's great achievement is the attainment of complete mastery
over the combined activity of the three soul forces; but at the same
time the responsibility for this activity is placed entirely in his own
hands.

It is only through this transformation of his being that the student can
enter consciously into relation with certain supersensible forces and
beings, for his own soul forces are related to certain fundamental
forces of the world. The force, for instance, inherent in the will can
affect definite things and the beings of the higher worlds, and also
perceive them; but it can only do so when liberated from its connection
with thinking and feeling within the soul. The moment this connection is
severed, the activity of the will can be exteriorized. The same applies
to the forces of thinking and feeling. A feeling of hatred sent out by a
person is visible to the clairvoyant as a fine luminous cloud of special
coloring; and the clairvoyant can ward off this feeling of hatred, just
as an ordinary

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

person wards off a physical blow that is aimed at him. In the
supersensible world, hatred becomes a visible phenomenon, but the
clairvoyant can only perceive it in so far as he is able to project
outwards the force lying in his feeling, just as the ordinary person
directs outwards the receptive faculty of his eye. And what is said of
hatred applies also to far more important phenomena of the physical
world. The student can enter into conscious intercourse with them,
thanks to the liberation of the fundamental forces of his soul.

Through the separation of the forces of thinking, feeling, and willing,
the possibility of a three-fold aberration arises for anyone neglecting
the injunctions given by esoteric science. Such an aberration can occur
if the connecting threads are severed before the higher consciousness is
sufficiently advanced to hold the reins and guide properly the separated
forces into free and harmoniously combined activity. For as a rule, the
three human soul-forces are not equally advanced in their development at
any given period of life. In one person, thinking is ahead of feeling
and willing; in a second, another soul-force has the upper hand over its
companions. As long as the

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

connection between the soul-forces is maintained as established by
higher cosmic laws, no injurious irregularity, in a higher sense, can
occur through the predominance of one force or another. Predominating
will, for instance, is prevented by the leveling influence of thinking
and feeling from lapsing into any particular excesses. When, however, a
person of such predominating will undertakes esoteric training, feeling
and thinking cease to exert their regular influence on the will when the
latter constantly presses on to great exertions of power If, then, such
a person is not sufficiently advanced to control completely the higher
consciousness and himself restore harmony, the will pursues its own
unbridled way, continually overpowering its possessor. Feeling and
thought lapse into complete impotence; the individual is scourged by his
over-mastering will. A violent nature is the result, rushing from one
unbridled action to another.

A second deviation occurs when feeling unduly shakes off its proper
control. A person inclined to the revering of others may then diverge
into unlimited dependence, to the extent of losing all personal will and
thoughts. Instead of higher knowledge,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

the most pitiful vacuity and feebleness would become such a person's
lot. Or, in the case of such inordinate predominance of the feeling
life, a person with an inclination toward religious devotion can sink
into the most degenerate welter.

The third evil is found when thought predominates, resulting in a
contemplative nature, hostile to life and locked up within itself. The
world, for such people, has no further importance save that it provides
them with objects for satisfying their boundless thirst for wisdom. No
thought ever moves them to an action or a feeling. They appear
everywhere as cold and unfeeling creatures. They flee from every contact
with the things of ordinary life as though from something exciting their
aversion, or which, at any rate, had lost all meaning for them.

These are the three ways of error into which the student can stray: (1)
exuberant violence of will, (2) sentimental emotionalism, and (3) cold,
loveless striving for wisdom. For outward observation, and also from the
ordinary (materialistic) medical standpoint, anyone thus gone astray is
hardly distinguishable (especially in degree) from an insane or, at
least, a highly

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

neurasthenic person. Of course, the student must not resemble these. It
is essential for him that the three fundamental soul-forces, thinking,
feeling, and willing, should have undergone harmonious development
before being released from their inherent connection and subordinated to
the awakened higher consciousness. For once a mistake is made and one of
the soul-forces falls a prey to unbridled excess, the higher soul comes
into existence as a miscarriage. The unrestrained force pervades the
individual's entire personality, and for a long time there can be no
question of the balance being restored. What appears to be a harmless
characteristic as long as its possessor is without esoteric training,
namely, a predominance of thinking or feeling or willing, is so
intensified in an esoteric student that the universally human element,
indispensable for life, becomes obscured.

Yet a really serious danger cannot threaten the student until he has
acquired the ability to include in his waking consciousness the
experiences forthcoming during sleep. As long as there is only the
question of illumination of the intervals of sleep, the life of the
senses, regulated by universal cosmic laws, reacts during the waking
hours

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

on the disturbed equilibrium of the soul, tending to restore the
balance. That is why it is so essential that the waking life of the
student should be in every respect regular and healthy. The more capable
he is of meeting the demands made by the outer world upon a healthy,
sound constitution of body, soul, and spirit, the better it is for him.
On the other hand, it may be very bad for him if his ordinary waking
life affects him in an exciting or irritating way, that is, if
destructive or hampering influences of outer life affect him in addition
to the great changes taking place in his inner self. He must seek to
find everything corresponding to his powers and faculties which can lead
him into undisturbed, harmonious communion with his surroundings, while
avoiding everything detrimental to this harmony—everything that brings
unrest and feverish haste into his life. And here it is not so much a
question of casting off this unrest and haste in an external sense, but
much more of taking care that thoughts, feelings, intentions, and bodily
health are not thereby exposed to continual fluctuation. All this is not
so easy for the student to accomplish as it was before esoteric
training, for the higher experiences now playing into

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

his life act upon his entire existence. Should anything within these
higher experiences not be as it should, the irregularity continues lying
in wait for him and may at every turn throw him off the right path. For
this reason the student should omit nothing which can secure for him
unfailing mastery over his whole being. He should never be found wanting
in presence of mind or in calm penetration of all situations of life. In
the main, a genuine esoteric training gives rise of itself to all these
qualities, and as it progresses the student only becomes acquainted with
the dangers while simultaneously and at the right moment acquiring the
full power to rout them from the field.
