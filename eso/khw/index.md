This is Rudolf Steiner's guide to the seeker on the path of esoteric
initiation. He includes much that would be of use to novices of any
mystical belief system, and a lot of tantalizing information about the
subtle body, higher planes of existence, and the spiritual encounter
with the 'Guardians of the Threshold.'

This text was created from the first (1947) edition of this English
translation, which has an unrenewed copyright in the US, and is
furthermore a translation of a pre-1923 book, which makes it public
domain in the US. The copyrights on the Steiner writings are somewhat
complicated. This is the first book by Steiner which we have been able
to create a public domain text of. We hope to add more in the future,
legalities permitting.
