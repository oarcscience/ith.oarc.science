### VII

### *THE CONTINUITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS*

HUMAN life runs its course in three alternating states or conditions,
namely, waking, dreaming sleep, and dreamless sleep. The attainment of
the higher knowledge of spiritual worlds can be readily understood if a
conception be formed of the changes occurring in these three conditions,
as experienced by one seeking such higher knowledge. When no training
has been undertaken to attain this knowledge, human consciousness is
continually interrupted by the restful interval of sleep. During these
intervals the soul knows nothing of the outer world, and equally little
of itself. Only at certain periods dreams emerge from the deep ocean of
insensibility, dreams linked to the occurrences of the outer world or
the conditions of the physical body. At

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

first, dreams are only regarded as a particular manifestation of
sleep-life, and thus only two states are generally spoken of, namely,
sleeping and waking. For spiritual science, however, dreams have an
independent significance apart from the other two conditions. In the
foregoing chapter a description was given of the alteration ensuing in
the dream-life of the person undertaking the ascent to higher knowledge.
His dreams lose their meaningless, irregular and disconnected character
and form themselves more and more into a world of law and order. With
continued development, not only does this new world born out of the
dream world come to be in no way inferior to outer physical reality as
regards its inner truth, but facts reveal themselves in it representing
a higher reality in the fullest sense of the word. Secrets and riddles
lie concealed everywhere in the physical world. In the latter, the
effects are seen of certain higher facts, but no one can penetrate to
the causes whose perception is confined merely to his senses. These
causes are partly revealed to the student in the condition described
above and developed out of dream life, a condition, however, in which he
by no means remains

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

stationary. True, he must not regard these revelations as actual
knowledge so long as the same things do not also reveal themselves
during ordinary waking life. But in time he achieves this as well: he
develops this faculty of carrying over into waking consciousness the
condition he created for himself out of dream life. Thus something new
is introduced into the world of his senses that enriches it. Just as a
person born blind and successfully operated upon will recognize the
surrounding objects as enriched by all that the eye perceives, to, too,
will anyone having become clairvoyant in the above manner perceive the
whole world surrounding him peopled with new qualities, things, beings,
and so forth. He now need no longer wait for his dreams to live in
another world, but he can at any suitable moment put himself into the
above condition for the purpose of higher perception. This condition
then acquires a significance for him similar to the perception, in
ordinary life, of things with active senses as opposed to inactive
senses. It can truly be said that the student opens the eyes of his soul
and beholds things which necessarily remain concealed form the bodily
senses.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Now this condition is only transitional to still higher stages of
knowledge. If the student continues his esoteric exercises he will find,
in due time, that the radical change, as described above, does not
confine itself to his dream life, but that this transformation also
extends to what was previously a condition of deep dreamless sleep.
Isolated conscious experiences begin to interrupt the complete
insensibility of this deep sleep. Perceptions previously unknown to him
emerge from the pervading unknown to him emerge from the pervading
darkness of sleep. It is, of course, not easy to describe these
perceptions, for our language is only adapted to the physical world, and
therefore only approximate terms can be found to express what does not
at all belong to that world. Still, such terms must be used to describe
the higher worlds, and this is only possible by the free use of simile;
yet seeing that everything in the world is interrelated, the attempt may
be made. The things and beings of the higher worlds are closely enough
related to those of the physical world to enable, with a little good
will, some sort of conception of these higher worlds to be formed, even
though words suitable for the physical world are used. Only the reader

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

must always bear in mind that such descriptions of supersensible worlds
must, to a large extent, be in the nature of simile and symbol. The
words of ordinary language are only partially adopted in the course of
esoteric training; for the rest, the student learns another symbolical
language, as a natural outcome of his ascent to higher worlds. The
knowledge of this language is acquired during esoteric training itself,
but that does not preclude the possibility of learning something
concerning the higher worlds even fro such ordinary descriptions as
those here given.

Some idea can be given of those experiences which emerge from the
insensibility of deep sleep if they be compared to a kind of hearing. We
may speak of perceptible tones and words. While the experiences during
dreaming sleep may fitly be designated as a kind of vision, the facts
observed during deep sleep may be compared to auricular impressions. (It
should be remarked in passing that for the spiritual world, too, the
faculty of sight remains the higher. There, too, colors are higher than
sounds and words. The student's first perceptions in this world do not
yet extend to the higher colors, but only to the lower tones. Only

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

because man, according to his general development, is already more
qualified for the world revealing itself in dreaming sleep does he at
once perceive colors there. He is less qualified for the higher world
unveiling itself in deep sleep; therefore the first revelations of it he
receives are in tones and words; later on, he can here, too, ascend to
colors and forms.)

Now, when these experiences during deep sleep first come to the notice
of the student, his next task must be to sense them as clearly and
vividly as possible. At first this presents great difficulty, the
perception of these experiences being exceedingly slight. The student
knows very well, on waking, that he has had an experience, but is
completely in the dark as regards its nature. The most important thing
during this initial stage is to remain quiet and composed, and not for a
moment lapse into any unrest or impatience. The latter is under all
circumstances detrimental; it can never accelerate development, but only
delays it. The student must cultivate a quiet and yielding receptivity
for the gift that is presented to him; all violence must be repressed.
Should he at any period not become aware of experiences during

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

sleep he must wait patiently until this is possible. Some day this
moment will assuredly arrive. And this perceptive faculty, if awaited
with patience and composure, remains a secure possession; while should
it appear momentarily in answer to forcible methods, it may be
completely lost for a long time.

Once this perceptive faculty is acquired and the experiences during
sleep are present to the student's consciousness in complete lucidity
and clarity, his attention should be directed to the following point.
All these experiences are seen to consist of two kinds, which can be
clearly distinguished. The first kind will be totally different from
anything that he has ever experienced. These experiences may be a source
of joy and edification, but otherwise they should be left to themselves
for the time being. They are the first harbinger of higher spiritual
worlds in which the student will find his way later on. In the other
kind of experiences the attentive observer will discover a certain
relationship with the ordinary world in which he lives. The subjects of
his reflections during life, what he would like to understand

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

in these things around him but cannot understand with the ordinary
intellect, these are the things concerning which the experiences during
sleep give him information. During every-day life man reflects on his
environment; his mind tries to conceive and understand the connection
existing between things; he seeks to grasp in thought and idea what his
senses perceive. It is to these ideas and concepts that the experiences
during sleep refer. Obscure, shadowy concepts become sonorous and living
in a way comparable only to the tones and the words of the physical
world. It seems to the student ever more and more as though the solution
of the riddles over which he ponders is whispered to him in tones and
words out of a higher world. And he is able to connect with ordinary
life whatever comes to him from a higher world. What was formerly only
accessible to his thought now becomes actual experience, just as living
and substantial as an experience in this physical world can be. The
things and beings of this physical world are by no means only what they
appear to be for physical perception. They are the expression and
effluence of a spiritual world.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This spiritual
world, hitherto concealed from the student, now resounds for him out of
his whole environment.

It is easy to see that this higher perceptive faculty can prove a
blessing only if the opened soul-senses are in perfect order, just as
the ordinary senses can only be used for a true observation of the world
if their equipment is regular and normal. Now man himself forms these
higher senses through the exercises indicated by spiritual science. The
latter include concentration, in which the attention is directed to
certain definite ideas and concepts connected with the secrets of the
universe; and meditation, which is a life in such ideas, a complete
submersion in them, in the right way. By concentration and meditation
the student works upon his soul and develops within it the soul-organs
of perception. While thus applying himself to the task of concentration
and meditation his soul grows within his body, just as the embryo child
grows in the body of the mother. When the isolated experiences during
sleep begin, as described, the moment of birth is approaching for the
liberated soul; for she has literally become a new being, developed by
the individual within

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

himself, from seed to fruit. The effort required for concentration and
meditation must therefore be carefully and accurately maintained, for it
contains the laws governing the germination and fruition of the higher
human soul-being. The latter must appear at its birth as a harmonious,
well-proportioned organism. Through an error in following the
instructions, no such normal being will come to existence in the
spiritual spheres, but a miscarriage incapable of life.

That this higher soul-being should be born during deep sleep will be
easily grasped, for if that delicate organism lacking all power of
resistance chanced to appear during physical every-day life it could not
prevail against the harsh and powerful processes of this life. Its
activity would be of no account against that of the body. During sleep,
however, when the body rests in as far as its activity is dependent on
sense perception, the activity of the higher soul, at first so delicate
and inconspicuous, can come into evidence. Here again the student must
bear in mind that these experiences during sleep may not be regarded as
fully valid knowledge, so long as he is not in a position to carry over
his awakened higher soul

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

into waking consciousness as well. The acquisition of this faculty will
enable him to perceive the spiritual world in its own character, among
and within the experiences of the day; that is, the hidden secrets of
his environment will be conveyed to his soul as tones and words.

Now, the student must realize at this stage of development that he is
dealing with separate and more or less isolated spiritual experiences.
He should therefore beware of constructing out of them a complete whole
or even a connected system of knowledge. In this case, all manner of
fantastic ideas and conceptions would be mixed into the soul-world, and
a world might thus easily be constructed which had nothing to do with
the real spiritual world. The student must continually practice
self-control. The right thing to do is to strive for an ever clearer
conception of the isolated real experiences, and to await the
spontaneous arrival of new experiences which will connect themselves, as
though of their own accord, with those already recorded. By virtue of
the power of the spiritual world into which he has now found his way,
and through continued application to his prescribed exercises, the
student experiences an

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

ever increasing extension and expansion of consciousness during sleep.
The unconscious intervals during sleep-life grow ever smaller, while
more and more experiences emerge from erstwhile unconsciousness. These
experiences thus link themselves together increasingly of their own
accord, without this true unity being disturbed by all manner of
combinations and inferences, which in any case would only originate in
an intellect accustomed to the physical world. Yet the less the habits
of thought acquired in the physical world are allowed to play into these
higher experiences, the better it is.

By thus conducting himself the student approaches ever nearer to the
attainment of that condition, on his path to higher knowledge, in which
the unconsciousness of sleep-life is transformed into complete
consciousness. When his body rests, man lives in surroundings which are
just as real as those of his waking daily life. It is needless to say
that the reality during sleep is different from physical reality
surrounding the physical body. The student learns—indeed he must learn
if he is to retain a firm footing in the physical world and not become a
visionary—to

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

connect the higher experiences of sleep with his physical environment.
At first, however, the world entered during sleep is a completely new
revelation. This important stage of development, at which consciousness
is retained in the life during sleep, is known in spiritual science as
the *continuity of consciousness*. The condition here indicated is
regarded, at a certain stage of development, as a kind of ideal,
attainable at the end of a long path. What the student first learns is
the extension of consciousness into two soul-states, in the first of
which only disordered dreams were previously possible, and in the second
only unconscious dreamless sleep. Anyone having reached this stage of
development does not cease experiencing and learning during those
intervals when the physical body rests, and when the soul receives no
impressions through the instrumentality of senses.
