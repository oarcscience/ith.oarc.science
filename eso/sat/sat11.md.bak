### CHAPTER VII

<span class="small">HOW ADAM IN PARADISE, AND HOW LUCIFER WAS A FAIR
ANGEL, AND HOW THEY WERE CORRUPTED AND SPOILED THROUGH IMAGINATION AND
PRIDE</span>

#### PROCESS

1\. <span class="smallcaps">We</span> will give an occasion of
consideration to the earnest searcher and seeker, and if he apprehends
our meaning he shall indeed be able to find the noble philosopher's
stone, but so that he be chosen thereto by God, and his life also stands
in the heavenly Mercury, otherwise we are a mystery to him; and we will
represent it to him in similitudes, in the most manifest, and yet
mystical manner.

2\. When Adam was created in paradise, the heavenly Mercury did then
lead him; his life burned in a pure oil, therefore his eyes were
heavenly; and his understanding did excel nature, for his light shined
in the oil of the divine essentiality; the external waterish property
was not manifest in his oil; he was *iliastrich*, that is, angelical,
and became in the Fall *cogastrish*, that is, the watery nature in the
mortal property was manifest in his oil, and penetrated, so that the
mercury in him became an anxious poison, which before in his oil was an
exaltation of joyfulness.

3\. For the salnitral flagrat in the impression in the coldness, viz.
according to the saturnine property, was thereby elevated, and got the
dominion, as a cold poison, which arises in the impression of death,
from whence the darkness was generated in the oil, and Adam died to the
divine light; to which the devil persuaded <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88) him by <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md)
the serpent, that is, by the essence and property of the serpent; for
the kingdom of wrath, and also the outward kingdom was manifest in the
serpent; for it was more subtle than any beast of the field, and this
subtlety Eve desired; for the serpent persuaded her that her eyes should
be opened, and she should be as God, and know good and evil.

4\. Which also was the will of the devil, that he would know evil: And
in the enkindling to the knowledge in Mercury he became corrupt and
dark; for he entered with the imagination,

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

according to his condition, knowledge, and desire, into the fiery byss;
and Adam, according to his knowledge and desire, went into the cold byss
into the impression, into the procreated watery property in the
salniter, where both kingdoms stand separated: He desired to prove and
taste the watery mercury, in which is the mortal poison; and Lucifer
\[desired\] the fiery Mercury, which gives strength and might; from
whence his pride arose, viz. out of the fiery Mercury: But both, viz.
Lucifer, and also Adam, lost the oil of the meekness of the divine
essentiality.

5\. Now we are to consider of the serpent, which deceived Adam with its
craft; how it was, and what its subtlety was after which Adam and Eve
did imagine; why they did eat of the forbidden tree which was evil and
good, and how they did eat death thereby; and what their salvation and
restoration is naturally and properly; what evil and good are, what the
property of the eternal life, and then the property of eternal death is;
what the cure is, whereby the sickness introduced by Adam, and its
death, may be healed, and restored both to the temporal and eternal
life.

6\. Let the reader attend to the sense and meaning; for we have not the
ability to give this into his hands; that only belongs to God; but the
gates shall stand open for him, if he will enter in; if not,
flattery <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) avails him not.

7\. The devil was a fair angel, and the serpent the subtle beast, and
man the likeness of the Deity; now all three were corrupted <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_91.md) by imagination and pride, and got the
curse of God for their false lust \[or cunning\].

8\. All whatever is eternal proceeds originally from one ground, as
angels and souls; but the serpent is not out of the eternal ground, but
out of the beginning, as we have before given you to understand, how
with the enkindling of the fire in the salnitral flagrat two kingdoms
separate, viz. eternity and time; and how the eternity dwells in the
time, but yet only in itself; but yet so nigh to the time, as fire and
light which are in one another, and yet make two kingdoms; or as
darkness and light dwell in each other, and the one is not the other.
The like we are to consider of the inchoative poisonful mercury in the
devil, and in man, and in the serpent also; how an oil corrupts, and yet
the essence or being of God is not hereby at all corrupted, but enters
into itself, viz. into the nothing; and the creaturely mercury, which
arises, or is begotten with the beginning of the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

creature in the creature, goes out of itself, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) that is, out of the eternal into time,
viz. into the beginning of the creature; it desires its own self, that
is, the beginning; and will be its own, or of a selfish property, and
forsakes the eternity, into which it should be wholly confined, and
resigned with its desire, and bring its hunger thereinto; and then its
poison-source would not be manifest.

9\. For whatever hungers after the eternal nothing, viz. after the quiet
meek liberty of God, that is not manifest to itself, but it is manifest
in the still liberty, viz. in God; for as the hunger is, such is also
the essence in the hunger; each hunger or desire makes itself an essence
according to the property of the hunger or desire.

10\. Thus the devil makes \[or causes\] in himself his darkness; for he
went with his desire into himself, into the property of the centre to
the desire, and forsook the eternity, viz. the nothing, that is, the
lubet of love; so that he enkindled himself in his poisonful mercury,
that is, in the forms to life in himself, and became an anxious
fire-source in the darkness; as wood that is burnt to a coal, which only
glows, and has no more any true light in it, also no oil or water; so it
went with him. Now in his own property, viz. in his life's forms, there
springs forth nothing but a stinging envious property, where one form
hates and annoys the other, and yet they so beget each other.

11\. And so was the serpent likewise, yet not by its own aspiring
haughtiness; but when God said; Let all sorts of beasts come forth, each
according to his property \[or kind\], then came forth beasts out of
every property of nature, as it was manifest in the separation, when God
moved himself to the creation; for the devil would domineer over the
love and meekness of God, and put his desire also into the anger, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) that is, into the austere might, where the
poison-life arises, viz. into the fiat of the wrathful property, out of
which form are proceeded vipers, serpents, toads, and other venomous
worms; not that the devil has made them, that he cannot; only as the
desire was in the impression of the fiat, such also was the creature in
the evil and good.

12\. For in the impression of the fiat, in the original of the outward
Mercury, viz. of the life, which is manifest to itself internally, was
the separation, where God and the world separate, viz. God
inwardly, <span id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_94.md) the world outwardly, <span
id="fr_95"></span>[4](#fn_95.md) as a similitude

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of the abyss, or a looking-glass of eternity; even there the inward
wrath, from whence God is called an angry zealous God, and a consuming
fire, manifested itself externally in figures, as in a similitude of the
inward birth in the centre; like as the eternal lubet, which he is
himself, stirs up \[awakens\] and causes the desire to the nature of the
eternal manifestation, and gives in itself into the desire, and turns
the wrath of the desire into joyfulness.

13\. Thus it is also with the serpent's craft: <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) In the highest Mercury is the highest
sharpest proof of all things; the more poisonful a thing is, the more
sharply it proves a thing; for the sharpest <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) taste and smell consists in the great
poison, viz. in a dying source.

14\. And the eternal light is generated <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_98.md) out of the Father's sharpness, that it
attains the shining, and goes forth with its own source through the
sharpness out of the anguish-source again into the liberty, viz. into
the nothing, where the light, by reason of the fire's-source and
property, becomes also a desire, which is the desire of the divine love
and joyfulness; in which desire Mercurius, the eternal word, or the
understanding of eternity, or deity, is rightly considered and named:
And this efflux from the fire (understand from the eternal magical
spiritual fire) is a procreation, viz. of the word of the power,
colours, and virtue: And this desire of the same mercury, or word, does
also modelise <span id="fr_99"></span>[4](#fn_99.md) the power into its own
desire, and makes it essential; which is the meekness and the love,
which quenches the wrath of the Eternal Father, viz. of the eternal
nature's desire with love, and changes it into joyfulness, where the
name of God has its original from eternity. This immassed essentiality
causes <span id="fr_100"></span>[5](#fn_100.md) two properties, viz. one
oleous, which is heavenly essence, a cause of the shining of the light;
and also a powerful \[property\] from the motion of the eternal
impression, or desire of the Father after the birth of the Son; from
whence the divine air (as the power through the shining of the light)
proceeds forth out of this love-fire, which is the Spirit of God.

15\. In like manner know this, that the eternal love (understand the
essence, viz. the heavenly essentiality) has given itself forth into the
creation with the verbum fiat, to set <span
id="fr_101"></span>[6](#fn_101.md) the Father's anger, viz. the form of the
eternal nature, into the highest joyfulness, and to set forth the
likeness of the eternal

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

generation; and where the nature of the wrath was most elevated through
the fiat, there also the desire did most incline itself towards the
liberty, to be free from the wrath, and to bring it into the kingdom of
joy, <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) from whence the great and
deep knowledge is arisen, and also the most precious and highest
tincture; understand the desire of the wrathful hunger received that
into itself after which it hungered, <span
id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md) viz. the liberty; for all things were
created good in the beginning; also the devil was good while he was an
angel; so also the serpent \[was good in its creation before the
curse\].

16\. But seeing the devil went into the highest fire's desire, God
departed from him, as a light that is put out, or extinguished in a
candle; and afterwards he lived according to his own desire.

17\. But seeing he knew that there was such a tincture in the serpent,
and the serpent being created out of the beginning of time, therefore he
insinuated <span id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_104.md) with his desire into
the serpent, and took possession of the serpent's tincture, and wrought
forth his desire through the serpent against man, to introduce him to
long after the serpent's property: For the serpent's tincture was from
both originals, viz. out of the deadly mercury from the dying in the
fire, viz. from the coldness in the impression; and then also from the
wrathful \[fiery property in the impression\]. The cold impression is
earthly, which arises from the wrath, viz. from the dying in the wrath,
in the impression; and the fiery \[impression\] arises from the quick
poison of mercury, in which property the spirit's life consists.

18\. Thus Adam and Eve were infected with the devil's desire through the
serpent, viz. through the earthly, deadly property of the serpent; and
also \[through\] the wrathful poisonful living property of God's wrath
according to the devil's own property; and was inflamed in his divine
oil, that is, in the heavenly essentiality.

19\. Even then the divine light, which shined out of the divine body of
the heavenly essentiality, was extinct to him; for the curse seized upon
the soul. Now God's cursing is a withdrawing, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[4](#fn_105.md) viz. the divine power, which was in the
body, departed into its own principle; and his holy oil (wherein the
power of God dwelt, and had made a kingdom of joy, viz. the paradise)
became a poison.

20\. For the earthly part according to the mortifying of the

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

water, viz. the cogastrish property, was manifest; and forthwith
mercury, viz. the coldness in the death's property, got the dominion,
whereas before he was as it were swallowed up in the divine power: Thus
Adam died unto God, and lived to death; here it was necessary that God
should regenerate him; and therefore the serpent was cursed, because it
had served, and willingly obeyed the devil.

21\. Thus we understand what lies hid in the greatest anguish, viz. in
the strongest mercury, viz. an oil, which cures and tinctures all
diseases; but the cold poison, viz. the death's source must be done
away, and put into a fiery \[property\] which is desirous of the light;
for God created all things good in the beginning, but through his
cursing or withdrawing the evil came in: For when God's love-desire
dwelt in the outward world's-source, and penetrated it, as the sun the
water, or the fire an iron, then the outward world was a paradise, and
the divine essence sprang forth and budded through the earthly, the
eternal life through the mortal; but when God cursed it for man's sake,
the mortal \[life <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md)\] was manifest
in man, and also in the fruit of which man should eat, which property
before was only manifest in the "tree of the knowledge of good and
evil," on which Adam and his wife were tempted, whether their desire
would enter into the eternity, viz. into God's essence, or into the
essence of time, into the living or mortal oil, in which source the
soul's spirit would live, that is, burn.

22\. Thus by God's curse, or withdrawing, the heavenly body was shut up,
and the anger-source set open, and so \[the heavenly body\] lies still
shut up: But seeing man by the eternal mercury, that is, by the word of
divine power, was in one part formed out of eternity into body and soul,
none could disclose <span id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md) the
poison-death, and destroy the mortal mercury, and change it again into
the light's-source, viz. into the source of the divine joyfulness, but
only the very divine Mercury, viz. the power and the word of life
itself: For the serpent's poisonful earthly property was manifest and
stirred up in man; therefore when God's word did pity the corruption of
man, and did again embrace him, <span id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_108.md) he
said, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head," and thou
(understand the serpent's poison or fire) shalt sting him in the heel.

23\. Herein now lies the philosopher's stone, \[to know\] how the seed
of the woman bruises the serpent's head, which is done in the spirit and
essence temporally and eternally; the sting of

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the serpent is God's anger-fire, and the woman's seed is God's
love-fire, which must be again awakened, and illustrate <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) the anger, and deprive the wrath of its
might, and put it into the divine joyfulness, and then the dead soul,
which lay immersed in God's curse, does arise: When the poisonful
Mercury, which resembles God's anger, is tinctured with love, then the
death's anguish in Mercury is changed into the highest joyfulness and
desire of love, which does again make a love-essence in itself, viz. an
heavenly body out of the earthly: When Mercury is changed into an
heavenly source, it desires no longer \[or more\] the earthly mortal
life; \[it desires\] not the four elements, but only the one, wherein
the four are contained, as it were swallowed up; as the light holds the
darkness swallowed up in itself, and yet the darkness is in it, but not
manifest in the light; as God dwells in time, and the time comprehends
him not, unless it be translated and wrapped up into eternity, that the
divine light does again shine in its source, and then the time is
manifest with its wonders <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110.md) in the
eternity.

24\. In this manner also is the process of the wise men with the
precious stone: There is no nearer consideration of the same than to
consider \[and know\] how the eternal word, viz. the heavenly divine
Mercury in the divine power, is become man, and has slain death, and the
anger in man, viz. changed the Mercury into the divine joyfulness,
whereby the human Mercury, which before lay shut up in God's anger, viz.
in the source of death, does with its new enkindled desire, which now is
called faith in the Holy Ghost, attract divine essentiality, viz.
Christ's body to itself, and sets itself in divine power and light above
the anger of God, and the poison of the serpent, and bruise the head of
the anger, viz. the poison of death with the life of divine joyfulness:
That is, the anger was master, but in the light it became a servant,
which now must be a cause of the joyfulness, as it is most plain, clear,
and manifestly made known and shewn to us in the mercurial life.

25\. Now observe the process, and meditate on it, ye dear children of
wisdom, and then you shall have enough temporally and eternally; <span
id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_111.md) do not as Babel does, which amuses and
comforts itself with the philosopher's stone, and boasts of it, but
keeps only a gross mason's stone shut up in poison and death, instead of
the precious philosopher's stone: <span id="fr_112"></span>[4](#fn_112.md)
What is it for Babel to have the stone, when it lies wholly shut up in
Babel? It is as if a

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

lord bestowed a country upon me, which indeed was mine, but I could not
take possession of it, and remained still a poor man notwithstanding,
and yet I boasted of the dominion, and so had the name, and not the
power: Even thus it goes with Babel about the precious stone of the
new-birth in Christ Jesus.

26\. In the sweet name, Jesus Christ, the whole process is contained,
what, and how the new-birth is out of death into life, which is very
clearly understood in the language of nature: For the name Jesus is the
property of the free lubet of eternity, which yields itself into the
pregnant centre, viz. into the Father's property, and figures itself in
the centre in the Father's property, viz. in the Father's fire, to a
word of eternal power.

27\. Understand, the Father, viz. the Father's fiery forms, do figure
\[shape\] this divine voice essentially in itself in the lubet of the
liberty; that is, the Father's fiery property makes itself in the divine
essence of the eternal love to a mercury of joyfulness; for the Father's
property is the fire-source, and the Son's, viz. the eternal lubet's
property, is the love-source; and yet also there would be no desire of
love, if the Father's fire did not enkindle it, and make it movable,
viz. desirous; from the fire arises the desire.

28\. The Father of all essences begets this holy desire through his
fire-source, which is now his heart of love, which gives in his fire the
shining lustre and splendour; even there the wrath in the fire's
property dies from eternity to eternity, and is changed into a
love-desire.

29\. Thus observe it; the free lubet's property is here in the fire's
property called Christ, which signifies in the language of nature a
potent champion, <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) depriving the
wrath of its power, a shining of the light in the darkness, a
transmutation, where the love-lubet rules over the fire-lubet, viz. over
the wrath, the light over the darkness: Here the seed of the woman
(understand of the free lubet, in which there is no source) bruises the
head of the wrath of the eternal nature, viz. of the eternal desire; for
the fire's property is rightly called the head, for it is the cause of
the eternal life; and the liberty, viz. the free lubet, or the nothing,
is rightly called the woman; for in the nothing, viz. in the liberty of
all source, <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) consists the birth of
the Holy Trinity of the Deity.

30\. Now the fire gives life, and the free lubet gives essence into the
life, and in the essence is the birth, where the Father, viz. the
eternal ground, begets his essence, viz. his heart out

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

of the abyss in himself, that is, out of the abyss in himself into a
byss; the Son is <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) the Father's
byss: Thus the Father remains in himself, as touching his own property
only, the byss of the eternal nature; and the Son remains in the Father,
the byss of the power and kingdom of joy; a resemblance whereof you see
in the fire and light: And thus the Son tinctures the Father with the
liberty, viz. with the nothing; and the Father tinctures (the Son) the
nothing, that there is an eternal life therein, and no more a nothing,
but a sound or voice of the manifestation of the eternity.

31\. Thus, dear philosophers, observe here the ground how you should
tincture; seek not the Son without the Father to tincture therewith: It
must be one body; <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) the
serpent-bruiser lies therein beforehand; for the seed of the woman has
not bruised the serpent's head without the humanity, but in the
humanity: The source of the divine lubet (understand of the love)
manifested itself through a resurrection <span
id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117.md) in the human essence, and became
manifest in the human life, and tinctured the wrath of death with the
blood of the divine tincture, and there the wrath of death was changed
into a source of divine love and joyfulness: Thus the love bruised the
head of the anger and the oleous poison in Mercury, and deprived the
wrath of its dominion, and sublimed the wrath into the highest
joyfulness; even there the anger, and the astringent cold death, were
made open shew of <span id="fr_118"></span>[4](#fn_118.md) in a fiery love:
Then it was said, "Death, where is thy sting? Hell, where is thy
victory? God be thanked who has given us victory."

32\. Now it behoves the wise seeker to consider the whole process with
the humanity of Christ from his opening in the womb of his mother Mary,
even to his resurrection and ascension; and so he may well find the
Feast of Pentecost with the joyful spirit, wherewith he may tincture,
cure, and heal whatever is broken and destroyed: We declare it in the
ground of truth, as we have highly known it; for the rose in the time of
the lily shall blossom in May when the winter is past, <span
id="fr_119"></span>[5](#fn_119.md) for blindness to the wicked, and for
light to the seeing.

33\. God be for ever praised, who has granted us eyes to see through the
poisonful heart of the basilisk, and see the day of restitution of all
whatever Adam lost.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

34\. Now we will come to the process of Christ, and go with him out of
eternity into time, and out of time into eternity, and bring again the
wonders of time into eternity, and openly set forth the pearl, for
honour unto Christ, and scorn to the devil; he that sleeps is blind, but
he that wakes sees what the May <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)
brings.

35\. Christ said, "Seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be
opened unto you: "You know that Christ signifies in a parable concerning
the wounded Samaritan, that he fell among murtherers, who beat him and
wounded him, and pulled off his clothes, and went away, and left him
half dead, till the Samaritan came, and took pity on him, dressed him,
and poured oil into his wounds, and brought him into the inn: This is a
manifest and lively representation of the corruption of man in paradise,
and also of the corruption of the earth in the curse of God, when
paradise departed from it.

36\. Now wilt thou be a magus? Then thou must become the Samaritan,
otherwise thou canst not heal the wounded and decayed; for the body
which thou must heal is half dead, and sorely wounded; also its right
garment is torn off, so that it is very hard for thee to know the man
whom thou wilt heal, unless thou hast the eyes and will of the
Samaritan, and seekest nothing else thereby but to restore the loss of
the wounded.

37\. Now consider! The eternal word manifested itself in Adam with
divine living essentiality, with the heavenly Mercury, but when the
soul's-fire in Adam, by the infection of the devil, poisoned the will's
spirit in Adam, and introduced it through the property of the serpent
into earthly deadly lust, then the heavenly Mercury of the heavenly
essence withdrew, that is, the soul's will departed from it with its
desire, and introduced its hunger into the earthly mortal essence, viz.
into the property of the cold Mercury, which had made stones and earth.
Adam's spirit would prove this \[Mercury\], and have the knowledge in
evil and good, and so this Mercury of the four elements immediately drew
him into its poison, and effectually wrought in him, and robbed him of
the divine property, stung, and wounded him with heat and cold, and made
him half dead, and stripped him of his angelical rayment, viz. the
garment in the pure element, where the heavenly source penetrates the
four elements, and tinctured them in Adam's body: Then he needed no
other garment, for heat and cold were as it were swallowed up in him; as
the day holds the night swallowed up in itself, and yet the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

night dwells in the day, but it is not manifest: Thus it went with man
when the property and source of the night seized on him, then it
domineered in him; and thus it went also with the earth when God cursed
it.

38\. Now wilt thou be a magus? Then thou must understand how to change
the night again into the day; for the source of the night, viz. of the
darkness, is the anguish-source of death; and the source of the day,
viz. of the light, is the life, and the lustre in the life; now Christ
has again enkindled this shining in the humanity, and quickened man
again in himself: Now if thou wilt tincture, then thou must change that
which is shut up, and closed in the death of the night again into the
day, for the day is the tincture, and yet the day and night lie in each
other as one essence.

39\. Now says reason, How may I begin to do it? <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) Look upon the process, how God began
with the humanity, when he would tincture the same.

40\. Christ came into this world in the shut-up human form, and brought
into the enclosed fortress of death the tincture of life, viz. the
Deity; he came into the world as a pilgrim in our poor form; he became
ours, that he might tincture us in himself: But what did he do? Did he
live in joy? Did he behave and carry himself as a lord? No; he entered
into death, and died, and put away the night's-source in him through us:
But how did he do it? He assumed the essence of our soul and body unto
the divine essence, and quickened our essence with the divine, that our
essence entered again with its will and desire into the divine essence,
and then the heavenly fiat was moved again in the humanity; for the
humanity inclined itself again into the liberty, viz. into the free
lubet of the Deity.

41\. This being done, the man Christ was tempted forty days, so Iona as
the first Adam was alone in paradise, and was tempted: Then the outward
earthly food was taken from him, and the humanity must eat with its
desire of God's essence; there was represented unto him all whatever the
first Adam had amused himself in, and whereinto he imagined, and wherein
he was captivated, as in the death of the night. This the devil, being a
prince of this world, now represented unto him in the property of death,
as he had represented it to Adam through the serpent, whereon Adam and
his wife did amuse themselves, and entered thereinto with the
imagination.

42\. Now behold! What did Christ do when he was to undergo

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the combat of this trial, when the human essence was to enter again with
its desire into the Deity, and eat of God's bread, that is, of the
divine essentiality? He went to Jordan, and was baptized of John. With
what? With the water in Jordan, and with the water in the word of life,
viz. the divine essence, which must tincture our mortal essence in the
outward humanity of Christ, from whence the divine hunger arose in the
human essence, that he desired to eat of God's bread: Therefore the
Spirit of God took him and carried him into the wilderness, and there
the Father's property in the wrath did oppose him through the prince in
the wrath; and there God's bread, and also the bread of God's anger
according to the death's desire, was tendered to him; now it was tried,
whether the soul, which was generated and created out of the Father's
property, would after this tincturation of baptism enter again into the
love-desire, viz. into the nothing out of all source.

43\. What is hereby intimated to the magus? A mystery is hinted to him:
If .he will do wonders with Christ, and tincture the corrupt body to the
new-birth, he must first be baptized, and then he gets an hunger after
God's bread, and this hunger has in it the verbum fiat, viz. the
*archeus* <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) to the new generation,
that is, the Mercury: But I do not speak here of a priest's baptism; the
artist must understand it magically; God and man must first come
together ere thou baptizest, as it came to pass in Christ: The Deity
first entered into the humanity, but the humanity could not presently
comprehend it, till it was quickened through baptism, and the hunger,
viz. the dead Mercury in the human essence, was again stirred up in the
heavenly part.

44\. And here began again the human eating; viz. the Mercury received
again divine property and will; and then the inward Mercury (understand
man's property) did eat in the taste of the divine word of God's
essence: And the four elemental properties did eat of the night's
property so long, till the human Mercury sublimed its life, and changed
the four elements into one: And the life tinctured death, which was done
on the cross: Then the four elements departed from him; that is, he died
to time, viz. to the night, that is, to the four elements, and arose in
the pure element, and lived to eternity.

45\. The magus must keep and observe this process also with his alchymy.
Dost thou ask how? I will not put it into thy mouth by reason of the
wicked, who is not worthy of it: Observe

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

only the baptism, that thou baptizest the dead Mercury, which lies in
the heavenly essentiality, enclosed and shut up in impotency with its
own baptism, \[and mark\] of what essence he is in a thing; <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) but thou must have this divine water,
and also the earthly; for the earthly Mercury cannot else receive the
divine \[Being\] except the divine Mercury receives of its power,
whereupon it stirs and hungers: Then the heavenly \[Mercury\] seeks, but
yet finds not divine essence about it for its food; thereupon it brings
its will through the desire of death into itself, viz. into the verbum
fiat, which has made and produced it, and sets its hunger upon the same;
whereupon the divine essence inclines itself to it, and will become
joyfulness in him; even then arises the beginning of the new body out of
the divine essentiality, which the desire nourishes and brings up; and
when the new life is born, viz. the day, then the four elements die: And
then the new body is shut up in the dark death, and on the third day it
rises again from death; for the night is swallowed up in the grave, and
the morning rises.

46\. If thou didst understand this, then hadst thou the pearl: But my
intent and purpose is otherwise; I will shew thee Christ along with it,
and also this pearl; therefore none shall find it but he that loves
Christ.

47\. Thou sayest, Tell me the baptism? and I have already told it thee.
Every hunger is a desire after its property; now if thou givest again
the property of death to the hunger of death, then death encreases; but
if thou givest him heavenly property, then death receives it not, for
hell is against heaven; therefore thou must give death and the anger of
God to death, and in this anger give him heavenly essence, viz. the
baptism, and so the baptism will swallow up the death into itself, and
then the anger dies in the death through the baptism, but not presently;
thou must first keep the process of Christ, and suffer the baptized to
preach, that is, appear in his divine form and colours; exceedingly
persecute and plague him, and give him no rest; for so the right Mercury
becomes working and active; and when he has shewn all his wonders
through the old Adam, then thou must cast the old and new man into God's
great anger, and slay the old man, ventilate him, and hang him
naked <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md) on the cross, and again take
him thence, and lay him into the putrefaction, viz. into the grave.

48\. And then Christ will arise from death, and appear; but

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

only his own know him: He walks about in heavenly form, and sometimes in
his own \[form which he had here\] until the Feast of Pentecost, for now
here is tried in him the highest perfection, whether he will persist in
the angel's form, and eat only of the divine essence; and then comes the
Holy Ghost, and proceeds with his power out of the whole corpus, viz.
out of the body and soul, which then tinctures the dead and broken
being; as it may be seen in the Day of Pentecost, where Saint Peter
tinctured three thousand souls at once with his heavenly Mercury, and
delivered them out of death.

49\. Dear seekers, herein lies the pearl; had you the universal, then
you could also tincture as Saint Peter did, but your covetous death
withholds you and shuts you up; for you seek only covetousness and
temporal honour in the pleasure of the flesh, to generate yourselves in
the night's property; therefore the pearl hides itself from you; yet the
day shall again appear when the wrathful anger of God is fulfilled,
satisfied and appeased in the blood of the saints, and turned to a
love-life; and the time is near.

#### PROCESS

50\. Every creature keeps in its generation and propagation to its own
kind; the male to the female, and the female to the male: Now God said
to Adam and Eve after the Fall, "The seed of the woman shall bruise the
serpent's head;" he said not \[the seed\] of the man: Herein lies the
baptism of nature: The male has the fire-spirit, and the female the
water-spirit to the tincture; now the Mercury is a fire-life, and makes
himself a body according to his hunger and desire; now the chief of the
work is in the beginning to give the fire-hunger a love-virgin out of
its kind for its consort, that so his wrathful hunger may be changed
into a love, and then they sleep together in their own marriage bed: Now
the devil is an enemy of this wedlock, who soon comes with a strange
desire, and tempts these married people, but dares not lay an hand of
violence on them, but only afflicts and plagues them with a false
strange desire; now if they yield their desire to his will, and his
desire overcomes them, then they become enemies to one another, and
bring forth a false child; for Christ said, "An evil tree bringeth forth
evil fruits, and a good tree good fruits."

51\. Therefore the artist must beware, and keep himself from such anger,
and yet must prepare a cross for this married couple;

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

for he is their foe and friend, that so they both in their marriage bed
of love might lift up their desire to God, and so with their desire
God's essence may be pregnant in their desire, and then in their
copulation they shall beget such a child, which they <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125) (understand the mother, viz. the female.md)
shall nourish in their belly, till it be ripe.

52\. In the meantime let the mother take heed she bear no love to any
other besides her consort, and also not imagine after strange things,
else she will imprint a spot or mark on the child; she must continue
simply in one love, till the child be perfect as to its body, which
comes to pass in the fourth month; yet according as the parents are of
one or other property, so strife and contrariety will arise in the
essence in the child, when the child is to receive its soul's life.

53\. But when the essence is in its wresting combat, the artist must
assist the soulish, viz. the fiery property, till the soul's spirit
attains its life, then he appears in the woman's form and lustre: Now
the artist supposes that he has the child that is born, but there
belongs a further time to it, till the soul grows strong, and then it
appears and shews itself in its red and white coat.

54\. But there is yet a wonderful process behind; when the soul's life
is born, then the new soul casts away the vegetable life of the parents
(which is propagated and inherited to the body from the parents’
*vegitta*, wherein the body of the child congealed <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126) and grew till the time of the soul.md), and
the life of the four elements dies, and the life in the one element
arises; the child is hidden in the dark death, and the artist supposes
it to be dead, but he must have patience till the child be born.

#### THE PECULIAR PROCESS IN THE SHAPING OF THE MAGICAL CHILD

55\. The course of Christ upon the earth is a real type how the new
child is nourished in the mother's womb after its conception, as is
before mentioned, and attains a vegetable life, and grows up to the time
of its right soul's and spirit's life; and how the child arises from the
parents’ essence; and how in the enkindling of its right, viz. of its
own life, it casts away the parents’ vegitta and working; and how a new
plant, viz. a new peculiar operation, does now arise according to the
new enkindled spirit's property, whereby the child is more noble than
its parents, understand as to its outward life.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

56\. But perhaps some rude clownish sophister might meet with this
treatise, and draw a strange understanding from it, in that I write of a
soul in the vegetative life; but let him know that we do not understand
the image of God, which was formed into a likeness according to God \[to
be\] in metals, stones, and herbs; but we understand the magical soul,
how the eternity, viz. the Deity, imprints and pourtrays itself into its
likeness, according to the model of its wisdom in all things, and how
God fills all in all; we understand the *summum bonum*, the good
treasure which lies hidden in the outward world's essence as a paradise.

57\. When Christ in his childhood grew up in human and divine property
till he was twelve years old, he went with his mother Mary to the feast
at Jerusalem, and went into the Temple among the Scribes, asked them,
and hearkened to them, and gave answer to the questions of the teachers;
but when his parents returned home, supposing him to be among the
company, he remained purposely behind among the doctors, and followed
not the intent of his parents, but the divine will, till they came back
again, and sought him; and then his mother said to him, "My son, why
hast thou dealt so with us? Lo! thy father and I have been seeking thee
sorrowing. Then he said unto them, How is it that you have sought me?
wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business? And he went home
with them, and was subject unto them."

58\. In this figure we have the type of the wills of the inward and
outward world, how they are in one another, and against one another, and
yet are but one: Even as in Christ there were two kingdoms manifest; one
which was wrought unto God's will, and broke the outward world's will of
its parents, in that Christ tarried behind contrary to the will of his
parents, at which they were troubled, which the divine will in Christ
knew well enough; and the other kingdom, viz. of his parents’ will,
broke the divine will, that he went home with them, and was obedient to
them according to their will.

59\. This figure shews the magus, that he shall find two wills in his
purpose, which he thinks to carry on; one will not be obedient and
subject unto him, viz. the divine will; and yet if its own peculiar
external will shall rightly apply itself thereunto, and only seek the
dear child Jesus with Mary, with desire and earnest sorrow, and not
earthly pleasure of the flesh, then the divine will will be obedient to
him, and go home with him, and be used according to his good pleasure.

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

60\. Secondly, it shews him the twofold working and will in all things;
and if he will be a magus, and according to his will turn the will and
essence of the good property out of the inward into the outward, then he
must be first capable of the inward, viz. of the divine will, otherwise
he cannot change the inward will into the outward; as Christ was not
obedient to the external will of his mother till she sought him with
grief and sorrow of heart, and turned her will into God's will, and
wrestled in his compassion with God's will, as Jacob the whole night,
till the Lord blessed him, and God said unto him, Thou hast wrestled
with God and man, and hast overcome, or got the victory.

61\. Also let the magus know, that he need not go about to implant the
right will to perfection from without into his purpose; it is already in
all things; only he must introduce a divine desirous will according to
the thing's property into that thing which he takes in hand, which
wrestles with the divine will as Jacob, and blesses the will introduced
to God's will, that the divine will yields itself freely into the
hunger, or inclines itself to the desire, and makes the imperfect will
(which earnestly presses into his compassion) perfect, and then it is
rightly said, Thou hast wrestled with God, and hast overcome; then thy
purpose obtains a transformed body, which is heavenly and earthly.

62\. Observe it! It is the first beginning to baptism, and so you are
fit and prepared to the baptism, and not otherwise, else you baptize
only with the water of the outward world; but the true magus baptizes
with the outward and inward water: If he has a right divine desire in
him, then God's will in his baptism is the first glimmering tinder in
Mercury, so that the life enkindles death, viz. the Mercury shut up in
death, and he gets divine desire; even then Mercury begins to hunger
after divine essence, and does his first miracle, and turns the water
into wine, as Christ did after his baptism: This is the first
tincturation in the dead corpus in the power of baptism, that the
vegitta, or working energetical life, obtains another property, viz. an
hunger of love, wherewith she embraces her bridegroom, viz. the
fire-source, that he is enkindled in her love, and changes his cold
deadly wrath and will into a fiery love-will: Then the mortal water
turns into wine (a sharpness of a fire and water-taste), out of which at
last comes an oil to another baptism, after the manner and disposition
of the artist, viz. according as he intends and begins; after the magus
has joined the virgin and young man together, then Christ, viz. the
bridegroom,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

is led with his bride into the desert, and tempted of the devil.

63\. Here is the trial whereby the artist is proved by God what he seeks
with his baptism; for here is the proof in paradise to try whether the
bridegroom be not too bad; for the virgin casts her love upon him, and
invites him; if he receives it with desire, and gives his will
thereinto, then she gives him her heart and will wholly: This is the
heavenly tincture, which gives itself into the enkindled anger of God
(viz. into the curse of the earth when God cursed it), that is, into the
Mercury enclosed in death, which is the bridegroom, for the seed of the
woman, viz. the heavenly tincture, must bruise the head of the serpent,
viz. the poisonful Mercury, in the property of death, and change his
poison into wine, and then the virgin receives the seed of the
bridegroom, and not before.

64\. The desert is the earthly outward body, where Mercury is tempted;
when the devil appears to Mercury, and plagues him, and assaults him in
his fiery essence, then must the virgin come to help him, and give him
her love: Now if the Mercury eats of the virgin-like love, that is, of
God's bread, then he may stand before the devil; and at last the angels
come to him, and serve him; the illuminated magus will well understand
what is meant by the devil.

65\. Hereby let the magus in the temptation (seeing the whole marriage
stands in the devil's temptation) have a careful eye upon his purpose;
and if the angels do not appear in forty days’ space, then is his
purpose in vain; therefore let him look, that he suffer not too fierce a
devil to tempt, and also not too weak, lest Mercury become light, and
desire to continue in his own poisonful death's property, and devour the
baptism as a wolf, and the old one remains.

66\. As soon as he espies the forms of angels, let him bring Christ out
of the desert, and let the bridegroom eat again his own food, and
dismiss the devil, that he may no longer plague him, and then Christ
will do many wonders and signs, at which the artist will wonder and
rejoice: Then he has nothing to do, the bride is in the bridegroom, they
are already married, <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) he need only
make their bed ready, they will warm it well enough themselves; the
bridegroom embraces the bride, and the bride the bridegroom; and this is
their food and pastime till they beget a child.

67\. But if the artist will needs be so diligent as to warm the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

married couple's bed, then let him have a care he do not anger and
enrage them in their love; what he begins he must go on with; only the
bridegroom is wonderful: He has continually two wills, viz. an earthly
hunger after God's anger, and an hunger after his bride; therefore he
must always have his own earthly food given him, but not into his belly,
but magically, that so he may satisfy only his own will's-hunger; his
food is his mother that begets him, as it is before mentioned.

68\. In brief, the whole work which men speak so much and wonderfully of
consists in two things, in an heavenly and in an earthly; the heavenly
must make the earthly in it to an heavenly: The eternity must make time
in it to eternity: The artist seeks paradise; if he finds it, he has the
great treasure upon the earth: But one dead man does not raise another;
the artist must be living, if he will say to the mountain, Arise, and
cast thyself into the sea.

69\. When the incarnation of the child begins, then first of all Saturn
takes it, and then it is dark and disesteemed, and is contemned and
derided, that such a mystery should lie hid in such a mean form; there
Christ walks in a poor simple form upon the earth, as a pilgrim, and has
not so much room and propriety in Saturn as to lay his head: He goes as
a stranger, as if he were not there at home.

70\. After this the moon takes it, and then the heavenly and earthly
properties are mixed, <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) and the
vegetative life arises, and then the artist rejoices; but he is yet in
danger.

71\. After the moon Jupiter takes it, who makes an understanding in
Mercury, viz. a pleasant habitation, and gives him its good will; and in
Jupiter his enclosed life, viz. Mercury is quickened, who takes it with
its orb, and forces it into the highest anguish: And then Mars
apprehends it, and gives the fire-soul to Mercury; and in the flagrat of
Mars the highest life enkindles itself, and separates itself into two
essences, viz. out of the love into a body, and out of the fire into a
spirit; then the life of love in the fiery flagrat sinks downwards, and
appears beautiful, but it is Venus, a woman: Then the artist supposes
that he has the treasure, but the hungry Mercury devours Venus, and the
child turns to a black raven; then Mars afflicts Mercury in himself,
till he grows faint, and yields himself to death: Then the four elements
depart from him, and the sun receives the child into its property, and
sets it forth in a virgin-like body in the pure element; for in the
property of Mars the light is

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

enkindled, and the right life is born, and stands in the pure element;
no anger nor death can destroy it.

72\. It seems strange in the eyes of reason, that God has kept such a
process with the restoring of man in Christ, that he appeared in such a
poor disesteemed form in the human property, and was reviled, mocked,
scorned, scourged, crucified and slain; and that he was buried, and rose
again out of the grave, and walked forty days upon the earth before he
entered into his invisible kingdom. Reason is so blind, that it
understands nothing of the eternal birth, it knows nothing of paradise,
how Adam was in paradise, and how he fell, and what the curse of the
earth is: If it understood this, the whole process were manifest to it:
As the eternal birth is in itself, so is also the process with the
restoration after the Fall, and so likewise is the process of the wise
men with their philosopher's stone, there is not the least tittle of
difference betwixt them; for all things originally arise out of the
eternal birth, and all must have one restoration in one and the same
manner.

73\. Therefore if the magus will seek paradise in the curse of the
earth, and find it, then must he first walk in the person of Christ; God
must be manifest in him, understand in the internal man, that he may
have the magical sight: He must deal with his purpose as the world did
with Christ, and then he may find paradise, wherein is no death.

74\. But if he be not in this birth of restoration, and walks not
himself in the way wherein Christ walked upon the earth, if he steps not
forth into the will and spirit of Christ, then let him give over and
leave off his seeking; he finds nothing but death, and the curse of God.
I tell him plainly and faithfully, for the pearl of which I write is
paradisical, which God does not cast before swine, but gives it to his
children for their play and delight.

75\. And though much might be mentioned here, that even reason might
obtain open eyes, yet it is not to be done; for the wicked would grow
worse, and more full of pride; therefore seeing he is not worthy of
paradise, and also cannot enter thereinto, no heavenly jewel shall be
given him: And therefore God hides it, and permits him to whom he
reveals it, to speak of it no otherwise than magically; therefore no one
attains it, unless he himself be a magus in Christ, unless paradise be
manifest in his internal man; and then he may find, if he be born to it,
and chosen by God.
