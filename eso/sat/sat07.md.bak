### CHAPTER III

<span class="small">OF THE GRAND MYSTERY OF ALL BEINGS</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Courteous</span> reader, observe the meaning
right; we understand not by this description a beginning of the Deity,
but we shew you the manifestation of the Deity through nature; for God
is without beginning, and has an eternal beginning, and an eternal end,
which he is himself, and the nature of the inward world is in the like
essence from eternity.

2\. We give you to understand this of the divine essence; without nature
God is a mystery, <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) understand in the
nothing, for without nature is the nothing, which is an eye of eternity,
an abyssal eye, that stands or sees in the nothing, for it is the abyss;
and this same eye is a will, understand a longing after manifestation,
to find the nothing; but now there is nothing before the will, where it
might find something, where it might have a place to rest, therefore it
enters into itself, and finds itself through nature.

3\. And we understand in the mystery without nature in the first will
two forms; one to nature, to the manifestation of the wonder-eye; and
the second form is produced out of the first, which is a desire after
virtue and power, and is the first will's son, its desire of joyfulness.
And understand us thus; the desire is egressive, and that which proceeds
is the spirit of the will and desire, for it is a moving, and the desire
makes a form <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) in the spirit, viz.
formings of the infinity of the mystery.

4\. And this form \[or likeness\] is the eternal wisdom of the Deity;
and we understand herein the Trinity of the only Deity, whose ground we
must not know, how the first will arises in the abyss from eternity,
which is called Father; only we know the eternal birth, and distinguish
the Deity, viz. what purely and merely concerns the Deity, or the good,
from nature, and shew you the arcanum of the greatest secret mystery;
namely, how the abyss, or the Deity, manifests itself with this eternal
generation; for God is a spirit, and as subtle as a thought or will, and
nature is his corporeal essence, understand the eternal nature; and the
outward nature of this visible comprehensible <span
id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md) world is a manifestation or external birth
of the inward spirit

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

and essence in evil and good, that is, a representation, resemblance,
and typical similitude of the dark fire and light world.

5\. And as we have shewn you concerning the original of thunder and
lightning with the tempestuous stroke; so likewise the inward nature of
the inward world is, and stands in the generation: For the outward birth
takes its original from the inward; the inward birth is unapprehensible
to the creature, but the outward is apprehensible to it; yet each
property apprehends its mother from whence it is brought forth.

6\. As the soul comprehends the inward eternal nature, and the spirit of
the soul, viz. the precious image according to God, comprehends <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) the birth of the angelical light-world,
and the sidereal and elemental spirit comprehends the birth and property
of the stars and elements; every eye sees into its mother from whence it
was brought forth.

7\. Therefore we will set down the generation of all essences out of all
mothers and beginnings, how one generation proceeds from another, and
how one is the cause of another, and this we will do from the eyesight
of all the three mothers.

8\. Let none account it impossible, seeing man is a likeness according
to and in God, an image of the Being of all beings; and yet it stands
not in the power of the creature, but in the might of God; for the sight
and science of all essences consist alone in the clearest light.

9\. We have made mention before how the external birth, viz. the essence
of this world, consists in three things, viz. in Sulphur, Mercury, and
Sal: Now we must set down and declare what it is, seeing that all things
arise from one original, and then how its inward separation is effected,
that out of one beginning many beginnings are produced; this is now to
be understood, as is before mentioned, concerning the centre of all
essences.

10\. For Sulphur in the eternal beginning consists in two forms, and so
also in the outward beginning of this world: viz. in the internal the
first form, viz. the Sul consists <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) in
the eternal liberty; it is the lubet of the eternal abyss, viz. a will
or an original to the desire; and the other original is the desire,
which is the first motion, viz. an hunger to the something; and in this
same hunger is the eternal beginning to the pregnant nature, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28.md) and it is called Sulphur, viz. a
conception of the liberty, viz. of the good, and a conception or
comprehension of the desire, viz. of the austere attraction in the
desire.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

11\. Sul in the internal is God, and Phur is the nature; for it makes a
spirit of the nature of brimstone, as is to be seen externally in the
property of brimstone; for its substance is a dry constringent matter,
and is of a painful anxious fiery property, forcing itself forth; it
attracts eagerly and hardly into itself, and parches up as a dry hunger,
and its painful property does eagerly and anxiously force itself forth:
The cause and original is this, because it stands in two beginnings,
viz. in the property of the desire, which is an attraction; and in the
property of the light or liberty, which is driving forth, or pressing to
the manifestation through the desire of nature.

12\. The desire, viz. the attraction makes hardness, and is the cause of
the fire, and the lubet is a cause of the lustre or light of the fire:
Sul is light, and Phur makes fire, yet it cannot be reduced alone in
Sulphur to fire and light, but in Mercury, and at last in Sal, which is
the real body, but not of the brimstone, but of the essence and water:
And so understand, that in the first desire, which arises in the lubet
of the liberty, all things are, and are made substantial and essential,
from whence the creation of this world is proceeded; and we find herein
the property of the earth, so likewise of all metals and stones, and
also of the astrum, <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) and the original
of the elements, all out of one only mother, which is the lubet and the
desire, from whence all things proceeded and still proceed.

13\. For Mercury is generated in Sulphur: It is the severing, viz. of
light and darkness from one another, the breaking wheel, and cause of
the various division or multiplicity: it separates the dark essentiality
from the essentiality of the light, viz. the metals from the gross,
astringent, dark, stony, and earthly property; for the property of the
desire gives and makes dark essence, and the property of the free lubet
makes light essence, viz. metals, and all of the same kind and
resemblance.

14\. Mercury has in the beginning of his birth three properties, viz.
the *trembling* in the austereness, and *anguish* from the hard
impressing of the astringent hard desire, and the *expulsion* of the
multiplicity, viz. the essential life; for the desire attracts very hard
to itself, and the attraction makes the motion, or sting of trembling
\[or horrible compunction\], and that which is impressed is the anguish;
but if the liberty be therein comprehended, it refuses it, and there
arises the original of enmity, and the severing, that one form separates
from another, and a twofold will arises.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

15\. For the lubet of the liberty does again set its desire into the
stillness, viz. into the nothing, and forces again out of the darkness
of the desire's austereness into itself, viz. into the liberty, without
the wrath of the enmity; and so it has only sharpened itself in the
austere impression in Mercury, that it is a moving feeling life, and
that its liberty is sharpened so that it becomes a lustre, which is, and
causes a kingdom of joy in the liberty; and so understand us, that the
spirit's dominion, viz. the spirit and the essence <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) do thus separate.

16\. The essence remains in the impression, and becomes material; that
is not God, but gold, or any other metal, according to the property of
the first conception in the Sulphur, or stone, or earth, out of the
desire's own peculiar property, all according to the first sude <span
id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md) or seething in Mercury; for no metal can
be generated without salniter, which is the flagrat in Mercury; which
also becomes material in the astringent impression, and divides itself
in the separation, one part into brimstone, another into salniter, and a
third into a salt sharpness; whereas yet there cannot be any corporeal
essence in all these, but only the spirit of the essence; the essence
proceeds wholly out of the death through mortification, which is
effected in the great anguish of the impressure, where there is a dying
source, which is the mercurial life, where the salnitral flagrat arises
as an opening, displaying flash: For the liberty, viz. the property of
the eternal lubet, does there separate itself, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[3](#fn_32.md) and yet the attracted essence out of the
lubet of the liberty continues all along in the comprehension of the
attraction in the astringent austere dark anguish: Now if the wrath
enters so vehemently into itself as to raise up the salnitral flagrat,
then it apprehends the essentiality of the free lubet in itself, from
whence arises the flagrat; for the wrath there apprehends the meekness,
which is even as if water were poured into fire, which gives a flagrat;
and then the wrath of the great anguish dies, and with the flagrat the
joy ascends, and the flagrat is out of mercury, or out of the anguish of
death, and becomes also material, but by reason of the liberty it
changes itself into white, which is salniter: Now if the fire, viz. the
horrible anxious sharpness, does again come into it, then the salniter
is dismayed, and gives a repulse; <span id="fr_33"></span>[4](#fn_33.md)
for the first property \[which was\] before the death is again enkindled
with the brimstone spirit; a sufficient resemblance of

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

which you have in gunpowder, which is the matter of these properties.

17\. Further, we are to know the dying with the enkindling of the fire,
all which is done in the flagrat; for it is a flagrat to death, and to
life; one part immerses itself into the property of death, viz. into the
wrath of the austere desire; and the other part, which is from the lubet
or love-essentiality, arises up in the kingdom of joy: But seeing there
happens also a mortifying in the free materia (though it is no
mortifying, but a redeeming from the wrath, for the materia of the
liberty will be free from the wrath), thereupon this materia falls <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) downwards, which is water; and it is not
of the property of the wrath, but the wrath holds it captive in itself;
but they are separated from one another in the essence and source; the
wrath's essence gives earth and stones, and the essence of the liberty
is water, which arises with the enkindling of the fire through the
mortification out of the meekness of the light.

18\. But seeing this water does also separate itself in the salnitral
flagrat, and before the salniter was all mutually enwrapt together,
thereupon it obtains different properties in the separation, and there
is a diversity of water; and this various diversity of properties gives
in each property also a bodily or corporeal essence, all according to
the first separation of mercury in sulphur, for in the mortification in
the salnitral flagrat two things are effected and come forth, viz. a
life, and a body of the life; understand an essential, and a lifeless
senseless body, whose materia is mortified in the flagrat: Thus there is
a diversity of water, and a diversity of the life, and a diversity of
the body, <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) or of the materia; as each
body is, so is also its essential spirit.

19\. Now we must consider this from the first original; as (1) from the
lubet of the liberty; and (2) from the desire to nature, or the
manifestation of the abyss.

20\. First, in the salnitral flagrat there is produced through the
anxious mortification a sulphureous water from the anguish, which
affords a brimstone, as we plainly see, and all whatever is of the like
sort and resemblance.

21\. Secondly, there is generated from the astringent, austere,
attractive property, which draws in to itself, a salt water; its materia
is salt; if it be again impressed through the fire or heat, then it
turns into salt; and all whatever is sharp and attractive, be it either
in herbs or trees, proceeds from thence; for there is

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

as much diversity of brimstone and salt, as there is variety of taste
and fire to be found in all creatures, herbs, and trees; also all
whatever lives and grows has brimstone and salt; for the saltish
property attracts, and preserves the body; <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) and the brimstone has in it the oil or
light, wherein the free lubet to manifestation consists, whence the
growth arises.

22\. Thirdly, there is brought forth through the salnitral flagrat out
of the property of the bitter compunctive attraction, in the first
impression in the spirit, an earthly property of water; its materia is
earth; for the same arises from the dark essentiality, where the
darkness impresses itself in the first desire, wherein the darkness
arises, as is before mentioned: Thus it begets out of its property in
the impression a mist, smoaky steam, or vapour, which the flagrat in the
salniter apprehends, and its essence is dismayed or dies, and falls
downwards; this is the materia of the earth, though the earth is not of
one only sort, but has in it all whatever became corporeal in the
flagrat, all which springs through the death of the earth, according as
it was wrapt and driven together in the creation into a lump, as we
plainly see.

23\. Further, we are to consider of the highest arcanum, viz. of the
heavenly essentiality, and then of the precious stones and metals, from
whence they all take their rise and original; seeing that all things
come out of one mother, which is the lubet and desire of eternity to its
own manifestation.

24\. Now concerning the incorruptible essence of corporality, the same
arises also in the first desire to nature, yet in the impression of the
free lubet, and goes all along through all the forms even into the
highest sharpness, where it retires again into itself, as a life out of
the fire: The eternal fire is magical, and a spirit, and dies not; the
liberty is its enkindler, but the eternal nature is its sharpness; this
same essence loses the wrath's property in the light; it is in the same
fire as a dying, yet there is no dying, but an entrance into another
source, viz. out of a painful desire into a love-desire; it yields also
spirit and essence from the fire-spirit, and the essence of meekness
from the light.

25\. For that which dies to the fire, or sinks through death, that is
divine essence; and it is effected likewise through the salnitral
flagrat of the divine joyfulness, where the property trembles in the joy
of meekness, and immerses itself through the death of the fire, which is
called God's anger, and quenches it,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

so that God dwells in a meek light; and the first property to the
enkindling of the light is fire, and wrath of the eternal nature, and
makes <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) the dark world.

26\. The properties of the first mother in the lubet and desire do also
divide themselves in the salnitral flagrat of joyfulness into distinct
parts, as is to be seen in this outward world; it yields also water, but
of a very sovereign essence, and it resembles only a spirit of a
pleasant lovely desire: This is the water of which Christ told us that
he would "give us to drink," and "whosoever should drink the same, it
should spring up in him to a fountain of eternal life."

27\. It retains also in the flagrat of the disclosure the fiery property
which is called heaven, in which the wonders of the divine kingdom of
joy are known and manifest; and in the watery property \[it retains\]
the pleasant spring, or paradise; for in the fiery \[property\] the
eternal element arises, and it is the real essence of the divine
corporality, wherein consists all whatever may be known in God, as is
sufficiently and in order cleared at large in our other writings of the
*Divine revelation*, treating of the *Divine wisdom*, and of the *Divine
eternal abyssal birth:* And now we will turn us to the essence of the
outward world, viz. to the manifestation of the eternal, viz. to metals,
herbs, and trees; so also to men and beasts.

28\. We see that the metals have another manner of body than the living
creatures, or are otherwise than the earth and stones are: Now reason
asks, How is the original of everything, seeing that in the beginning
all arose out of one mother, and yet the eternity has no temporal
beginning? Here we must again consider the mother of the first
pregnatrix, where, and how one essence separates itself from another,
viz. the inchoative from the eternal, time from eternity, and yet they
stand mutually in each other, but are severed into two principles, viz.
into the kingdom of God, and of this world; and yet all is God's: But
seeing Christ calls the devil "a prince of this world," and we also are
able to declare how far, and in what he is a prince, and that this world
is not his own, <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) but he is the
poorest creature in this world, and also not at all in this world; now
therefore look upon the first ground, upon the mother which has thus
generated all creatures.

29\. So also as to the earth, stones, and all metals, the earth's
property, consists in a spiritual Sulphur, Mercury, and Sal, and all
whatever has had beginning is arisen in and out of her

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

impression, and inchoatively thereupon it came forth with the first form
of the mother, viz. with the astringent attraction, through the fiat
into a creatural being, and affords a diversity of essence and spirit,
according to the first property of the separation.

30\. As first, the high spirits, which were created out of the free
lubet in the desire, in the fire's property, viz. out of the centre of
all essences, had in them the properties of both the eternal worlds; but
those which after their corporising \[or being made creaturely\]
remained with their desire in the property of the free lubet, and
introduced their will out of the fire into the light, they became
angels; and the other, which introduced their desire again into the
centre (viz. into the austere properties), became devils, viz. outcasts
from the free lubet out of the light, as is mentioned in other writings.

31\. Therefore the devils have neither the kingdom of God, nor the
kingdom of this world in possession; for in the beginning of the
creation this world was created out of both the inward properties,
whereupon the devil has now only the wrath's part in possession, the
other profits him nothing; and thus he is in the world, and also not in
the world, for he has but one part thereof in possession, from the other
he is cast out.

32\. After the creation of the highest spirits, God created this visible
world with the stars and elements as an external birth out of the mother
of all essences; all which proceeded out of the eternal beginning, and
took a temporal beginning: For here we are to consider, that the eternal
pregnatrix moved itself, and enkindled its own form \[or similitude\],
where then the one became corporeal in the other; but afterwards God
created the earth, which we are thus to consider of.

33\. The first desire to nature impresses itself, and introduces itself
with the impression into three forms, viz. into Sulphur, Mercury, and
Sal, and in the impression all become rising and moving, which is not in
the still nothing, and so forces itself into the highest anguish, even
to <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) the salnitral flagrat, where then
is the original of the fire: Thus the source whirls in itself, as a
boiling of water upon the fire: for the austere desire is attractive,
and the fiery is expulsive, which is a sulphur; and the astringent
attraction is a wrathful sting \[or compunction\], viz. a contrition;
and yet it is held by the austereness, that it cannot move away,
whereupon it is painful, and causes pain, as if it were seething, which
yet is only spirit without essence,

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

which comes to pass in Mercury, and is Mercury's own form.

34\. And there is the separation of two wills, viz. one remains, and is
the very anxious essence, seeing it originally arises from the desire;
the other, which arises out of the lubet of the liberty, retires back
again into itself into the liberty, and yet there is no parting or
dividing from one another, but thus it goes one with another all along
through the enkindling of the fire through the salnitral flagrat, where
with the enkindling of the fire the death is effected in the wrath of
the fire, where the source dies, and yet there is no death, but a
likeness of death; and yet the real, eternal, and temporal death is in
that manner, even where the liberty apprehends itself in itself, and the
death or flagrat falls down into the liberty as impotent, and freely
resigns itself; and the spirit, viz. the source (understand the very
sharp, fiery, anxious source), becomes material, and retains only an
essential working, like to an impotent desire; and in the enkindling of
the fire in the salnitral flagrat each property separates itself in
itself, and the whole materia is particularised, viz. to metals, stones,
and earth.

35\. The highest metal, <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) as gold,
arises from the liberty, which is comprised all along in the flagrat in
the astringent impression; and it is not free from the materia of the
rest, for all is comprised or wrapt up together; but seeing the liberty
with the Sul, or light's property, is comprised or comprehended therein
also, thereupon Sul is expulsive to the manifestation of itself, as it
is the property of the liberty so to be: Hence it comes that metals
grow, and not the gross hard stones, which are too hard comprised in the
impression out of the wrathful essentiality, and have too little Sul in
them.

36\. But concerning the precious stones, with their radiant lustre and
great virtue, the same have their original in the flash of the fire,
where life and death separate; as when one part by reason of the dark
essentiality descends, and the other by reason of the liberty ascends,
and yet all is brought into essence in the flagrat; so that the same
flash or glance becomes also material in the flagrat; and therefore they
are hard, and of a blinking glance, like an eye; for so also is the
original of the eye or sight in the womb, <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md) when the life enkindles; all according to
the right of eternity.

37\. And therefore they are of so great power, efficacy, and virtue, in
that they are so nigh to the Deity, and bear the

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

incorporated names of the divine power in them; as also gold is nigh to
the divine essentiality, or heavenly corporality: If man could open \[or
disclose\] the dead body, and reduce it to a flying <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) moving spirit, which only can be effected
through the divine motion, then it should be seen what it could be,
which no reason believes or understands without divine sight \[or
vision\].

38\. Further, we are also to consider of the other metals and minerals,
which in like manner do thus take their original; but in the salnitral
flagrat each property is separated; as we see that the property of the
fire and light is different, and all from the first impression; where
before the impression the lubet and desire of the liberty stand mutually
in each other, as a *chaos*, a complexion of great wonders, where all
colours, powers, and virtues are contained in this only <span
class="smallcaps">Chaos</span>, or wonder-eye; which <span
class="smallcaps">Chaos</span> is God himself, viz. the Being of all
beings, who thus manifests himself in particular beings with the eyes of
eternity; each materia is an essence according to the spirit from whence
it was generated; and if it be enkindled in the fire, it yields likewise
such a light as the spirit is in the essence.

39\. And thus also we are to consider of the metals; what kind of spirit
each of them has, such a glance and lustre it yields, and also such a
body <span id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md) it has.

40\. As the mind acts and moves the thoughts and senses from the highest
to the lowest, and comprehends and commands by the thoughts from the
highest to the lowest; so the eternal mind has manifested itself from
the highest majesty, even to the lowest \[meanest, or outermost thing\],
viz. to the greatest darkness; and this world, with the sun, stars, and
elements, and with every creaturely being, is nothing else but a
manifestation of the eternity of the eternal will and mind; and as it
was in the beginning, so it still stands in its seething and
vegetation, <span id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_44.md) and so it still puts
forward to light and darkness, to evil and good. And all things consist
in these first three forms, viz. in Sulphur, Mercury, and Sal, as one
degree in order after another; for so likewise are the quires of the
spirits, as also of the stars, trees, herbs, and of all kinds whatever
which have been, and are; so also are the inward heavenly quires with
their distinction.
