### CHAPTER IV

<span class="small">OF THE BIRTH OF THE STARS, AND FOUR ELEMENTS IN THE
METALLINE AND CREATURELY PROPERTY</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">As</span> it is before mentioned, all things
proceed out of one only mother, and separate themselves into two
essences, according to the right of eternity, viz. into a mortal and an
immortal, into life and death, into spirit and body; the spirit is the
life, and the body is the death, viz. a house of the spirit: As the holy
Trinity stands in the birth, so also is the external birth: There is
likewise essence and spirit in heaven; a figure of which we see in this
outward world, where there are four elements, and yet there is but one
only element, which separates itself into four properties, viz. into
fire, air, water, and earth, as is above mentioned.

2\. For so we are to consider of the creation of this world, that the
whole essence of eternity has moved itself in the place <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) of this world, and the whole form was
enkindled and stirred, and that in the desire to manifestation; and
there the generation divided itself in the flagrat of the enkindled fire
into four parts, viz. into fire, water, and earth, and the air is its
moving egressive <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md) spirit; as is to be
considered in Sulphur, which consists in these four things.

3\. In like manner also the astrum is thus generated out of the first
mother; and all put together is only one body, and it all takes its rise
from the inward spirit; as a hand or foot grows forth from the inward
centre, and has already its form in the centre, viz. in the first
operation, and so only grows into a form as the spirit is.

4\. The first mother of all things, viz. the lubet with the desire, does
especially introduce itself into seven forms, and yet continues
steadfast in three only, but manifests itself in seven forms. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47.md)

5\. The first form is astringent, viz. an austere attraction, which is a
cause of coldness and salt, and all corporality.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

6\. The second form is the compunction, <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) viz. the drawing or motion, and causes the
feeling, also pricking, aking, tormenting; the affection <span
id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) of bitterness, enmity and friendliness,
joy and sorrow.

7\. The third form is the great anguish in the impression, which causes
two wills, viz. one to the fire, where the will of the free lubet falls
down to the wrath in the fire, and again goes into itself, and makes a
lustre in the fire's sharpness.

8\. Now the fourth form is the fire itself, viz. the first principle in
the life, with which the dark and light world do separate; also in this
flagrat all material separations are effected, and the corporality and
multiplication begin according to the property of the first eternal
mind, viz. according to the essentiality a mortal \[ens\], and according
to the free source a living \[*ens*\].

9\. The fifth form is now the second desire, which is effected after the
separation, and that according to two properties; viz. one according to
the lubet of the liberty out of the light, which is the highest
love-desire; and the other according to the fire's lubet, which leads
its life of its essence in the love in the light, from whence the
joyfulness and every true life arises.

10\. The love gives essence; for it is expressive, and yielding, viz.
itself; for God gives himself to every essence; and the fire is
receptive; for it needs essence in its wrathful hunger, else it
extinguishes; and then the lustre of the light would go out, and the
desire of love would cease, for the fire makes the light desiring, viz.
of the joyfulness; for if the fire dies, the light waxes dark, and love
turns into anguish, as may be conceived of in the devils.

11\. The sixth form arises from the turning wheel before the fire, where
the multiplication of the essence arises out of the property of
Mercurius in the salnitral flagrat; with the enkindling of the fire one
form is introduced into another; and if now the love-desire penetrates
all the forms, then all the forms grow very desirous the one after the
other, for the dear lovely child Venus is in all.

12\. Here begin the taste, smell, hearing, seeing, feeling, and
speaking; for the light opens another principle of another source, and
fills all; and here springs up the life in death, viz. the love in the
anger, and the light shines in the darkness; here the bridegroom
embraces his bride, and God himself resists his anger, viz. the wrath of
nature; and in this form all speeches, understanding, and senses arise,
and the true real life of all

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

creatures; so also the life in the vegetables, viz. trees and herbs, in
each thing according to its property.

13\. The seventh form arises from all the other, and is the body,
mansion-house, or food of the other, and it is thus effected; when the
other forms taste each other in their mutual penetration in the
love-desire, then in each form there is an hunger or desire after the
love, viz. after the light; now each hunger or desire is reaching forth
after the thing it desires, and eagerly attracts the property of the
thing desired; and thus out of two one essence is made, viz. out of the
hunger, and that which the hunger desires; for this hunger does not
stand in death, it does not any more enclose itself up in death, unless
it be too great, and the imagination in the hunger be too great, and the
hunger cannot obtain that same thing, then it choaks; as many times a
child is so choaked or smothered in the mother's womb, if this form be
enkindled in another form to eat of some external thing, whereupon the
mother grows so ardent in longing, and if she cannot get it, the child
also cannot get it; now it choaks in the hunger, or else a member is
spoiled, from whence the hunger arose.

14\. The first hunger in the centre before the fire is a spiritual
hunger, which makes the dark world; and the hunger of the free lubet
makes the light world; both which are only spirit, till they pass both
together through the enkindling of the fire, where then they are
mortified to the spirit, and are a likeness of the first spirit, viz. a
manifestation of the incomprehensible spirit, which is called God in
love and anger, in a twofold source: Thus each stands undivided in
itself, viz. God in the time, and the time in God, and the one is not
the other, but they come from one eternal original; thus the temporal
spirit's hunger gives a temporal body, and the eternal spirit's hunger
affords an eternal body, and are both mutually in each other, and yet
are distinct. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

15\. The seven forms make them a body according to their hunger out of
their own property; therefore all whatever the spirit has in all
properties lies in the body.

16\. Further we are to know, that there is a separation made in the
creation of this world; for this is to be seen in the sun and stars; so
likewise in all creatures; also in metals, stones, and earths; for this
same is the manifestation of God.

17\. We see in the firmament seven planets, and in the earth seven
metals which are fixed, and also seven planets only which

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

are fixed in their property; the rest are minerals, and so of the stars:
And as the planetary orb has its predominant stamp or influence, so is
also the birth of each thing.

18\. As the Deity, viz. the divine light, is the centre of all life; so
also in the manifestation of God, viz. in the figure, the sun is the
centre of all life; in the highest life the highest things have taken
their beginning, and so forward successively one from another to the
lowest: In every external thing there are two properties; one from time,
the other from eternity; the first property of time is manifest; and the
other is hidden, yet it sets forth a likeness after itself in each
thing.

19\. Whatever has its beginning out of the lubet of the liberty stands
with the root in an heavenly property, and with the body in an earthly;
but the eternal stands in time, and manifests itself with time.

20\. Sulphur is on one part in the internal heavenly, and as to the body
earthly, yet puts forth an heavenly likeness according to the eternal
out of itself, which is fixed and stedfast; as is to be seen in gold,
and is much more to be understood in the human body, if it were not
corrupted in the desire in Mercury; for the spiritual or heavenly man
consists in Sulphur, and in Mercury the corporeal, viz. the similitude
of the divine \[man\]; so also the metalline property in Sulphur is the
noblest, most excellent, and highest, for it is the highest spirit.

21\. Understand it thus: In the heavenly being there is also a property
of a seething, <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) when the liberty is
apprehended and enkindled in the highest desire, wherein the joyfulness
arises; this is effected in the heavenly Sulphur, where it is made
essential in the heavenly Mercury, viz. in the eternal word, which is a
spiritual essence.

22\. But if the same spirituality longs to manifest itself in a
similitude, both according to the property of the spirit, and the
essentiality too, according to the Trinity of the Deity, according to
the mortal and immortal essence, then that image is represented in the
stars and elements; and lastly it is set forth in man, who is a lively
image of the whole essence according to the divine and outward world;
also the inward and outward worlds are represented with the metals in a
mortal image, as a resemblance and similitude of the living heavenly
essentiality.

23\. The beginning is in Sulphur; for Sul is the lubet of the light, or
the liberty, which longs to manifestation, and it cannot otherwise be
effected but through fire: In Phur arises the desire,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

viz. an austere attraction, which makes the dark earthly property, and
the austereness of the spirit, viz. the fiery essence: In this
austereness arises Saturn, which is the thing impressed; and Mercury is
the desire of the hunger, and the rager, raver, and breaker; and Mars is
the wrath in the hunger, a cause of anger; these three are the property
of Phur, viz. of the free lubet's desire.

24\. The free lubet's property begets the essence in the three
fore-mentioned forms, viz. in Saturn, Mercury, and Mars; for it gives
itself in to each property, and the property in the hunger of Mercury
makes it a corporeal form; but if the free lubet turns also to an hunger
in the austere desiring, then it makes also three forms according to
itself, viz. Jupiter, who is the understanding of the lubet; and Venus,
which is the desire of the lubet; and Luna, which is the body of the
lubet; and according to the property of the light it makes Sol; all this
is spirit; but now in every spirit's hunger there is also an essence,
both according to the mortal and immortal ens, a fixed, and unfixed; a
figure according to the heavenly, and a figure according to the earthly
\[being, or property\].

25\. In the saturnine property the desire of the free lubet makes
(according to Saturn's own property) lead, and according to the watery
\[property\] in Saturn, salt; and according to the mortal and earthly
\[property\] in Saturn, stones, and earth, and all whatever is of that
sort and semblance.

26\. But according to the liberty, or according to the free desire's own
property (in that it yields up itself to Saturn, viz. to the desire), it
makes in Saturn gold, according to the desire of the light, where the
spirit and body separate; the spirit of its desire is Sol, and the body
is gold, understand, the golden body is in Saturn according to the
property of the free desire, and not according to Saturn's property; his
property in himself is lead, salt, and earth; but he keeps the golden
child shut up in himself as a black raven, not in his gray form, but in
a darkish cast: He is a great lord, but his dominion, by reason of the
golden child which he has in his bowels, stands not in his own power: He
is not father of the child, but Mercury is he which forms <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) the child; but he puts his morning mantle
upon it, that he can have no joy with the golden child; he corporises
the fair child; for he is its fiat or creator, and hides and covers it
close under his mantle: He cannot give it the body from his own
property, for it (understand the golden body) is the essence of

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the free desire in the highest degree of corporality in the fixed death,
where yet there is no death, but an enclosing, and in the similitude a
representation of the divine heavenly essentiality.

27\. Mercurius is the master-workman <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md)
of this child, which Saturn hides; when he gets it into his hunger, he
casts off his black cloak, and rejoices in it; but he is too malignant
in his fire-wrath, <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md) he devours the
child, and turns it wholly to his own property: When he is most sharply
hungry in the fire, then Sol must be given him (it is his wife) that his
hunger may be appeased; and then when he is satisfied, he labours in the
materia of the child with his own hunger or fire, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55.md) and fills up his sufficed desire out of
Sol's property, which he before had eaten, and nourishes the child till
it gets upon it all the four elements with the constellation, and he
grows exceeding pregnant with the child, and then it belongs \[or is fit
for\] a strange fire, and yet not strange, an earnest fire; and then the
father gives it the soul, viz. the fire-spirit; and its first mother,
which Mercury did eat down in its hunger, which was fixed and perfect,
\[gives\] the soul's-spirit, viz. the light-life: Then the death <span
id="fr_56"></span>[4](#fn_56.md) arises, and the child is born, and becomes
afterwards its own, and a child of the liberty, and cares no more for
its work-master: It is better than its father, but not better than its
mother, in whose seed it lay, before the father wrought in it; it
bruises the head of its father's fiery essence, viz. of the serpent, and
passes freely through death in the fire: Dost thou understand nothing
here? Then thou art not born to the highest knowledge of the spagirical
science.

28\. Further, we are to consider of the degrees, what the liberty, viz.
the eternal lubet, gives to the hunger of the other forms in Sulphur, in
the property of the other planets; the form of the birth is as a turning
wheel, <span id="fr_57"></span>[5](#fn_57.md) which Mercury causes in the
Sulphur.

29\. The birth of the highest degree turns round (viz. the desire), for
this world is round, so also the birth; when the liberty has given its
highest lubet (as a golden hunger) to Saturn, and placed Mercury for
work-master, then it betakes itself into itself, into its desire,
according to the property of meekness; for the first conception to the
golden child is effected according to

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the property of joyfulness; but this out of goodness and meekness
resigns itself to Luna; for it is a pleasant demission by reason of the
meekness, which Mercury apprehends and works therein also; this body is
silver, and comes from the first impression, where the yellow and white
separate in the fire, viz. the colours of the virtue; then Luna arises
out of the yellow and turns into white, by reason of the divine
meekness; and because its original is from Sol's colour, therefore it
has a perpetual hunger after Sol, and receives the sun's lustre into it,
puts it on <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) and shines with it.

30\. Now as the superior is, so is likewise the inferior (namely
metals), therefore silver is the next degree to gold; and as gold is
generated, so is also silver: Venus clothes it, which Mercury cannot
endure, seeing he is the master-worker, and he gives his garment also;
but the silver has neither the property of Venus nor Mercury, for it
retains the property of its mother, viz. the meekness in the liberty,
and is hatched, as the gold by reason of the sun: The moon has an
heavenly property, but in reference to its own proper form from the
property of the desire, it is of a very earthly property, it is a
cabinet and keeper of the earthly and heavenly essence: In like manner
as the outward body of man, which before the Fall in Adam was comparable
to silver, but when he died in the lubet then the earthly property only
lived in him, and therefore he continually hungers after Sol's glance
\[and glory\], he would fain take again his splendour with Luna from the
sun, but he gets only an earthly lunar lustre, wherein he acts and
exercises pride, unless he be born again out of Sol's splendour, that
is, out of God's power in the heavenly Mercurius; and so he becomes
again the golden silver-child in divine essentiality, only covered and
clothed this life-time with the earthly moon, that is, with earthly
flesh.

31\. Saturn also is the house of silver, he is likewise the cause of the
first conception, but he turns his desire only upon the golden child,
and leaves the silver its garment, and takes it into his stony earthly
property, and lets Mercury hatch it.

32\. The desire of the free lubet is fixed and steadfast, as concerning
the property of the desire only, which brings its will again from the
body into the combat in the senses, and makes Jupiter, that is on the
orb <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) upwards under Saturn under the
saturnine power; its metal is tin, and it is the third degree; for the
lubet of the liberty in the desire proceeds forth into the desire of the
austereness, and so it gives itself into the fiat.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

33\. We must understand it thus; the lubet of the liberty goes forth out
of itself, as a plant, and makes one degree after another in order, but
Mercury makes the sphere, for he is the work-master: And as the eternal
birth is in itself in the heavenly Mercury, viz. in the eternal word in
the Father's generation; so likewise with the motion of the Father it
came into a creaturely being, and so proceeds in its order, as may be
seen in the wheel of the planets; for the order is just so placed as man
is in his order.

34\. First there is in him the true golden divine man, which is the
likeness of God: Next there is in him the man of heavenly essentiality,
viz. the inward holy body, generated from the fire and light in the
tincture, which is like to the pure silver if it were not corrupted.
Thirdly, there is in him the elemental man from the pure element
resembling Jupiter. Fourthly, the mercurial, which is the growing or
paradisical \[man\]. Fifthly, the martial, from the fire, viz. the
soulish \[man\], according to the Father's property. Sixthly, the
venerine \[man\], according to the outward desire, and the water's
property. Seventhly, the solar, according to the sun's property, viz.
according to the outward world, as a seer and knower of the wonders of
God: And yet it is but the one only man; yet is both in the inward and
outward world. Thus likewise is the similitude \[or form\] of the seven
metals; with one property according to the inward world, and with
another visible and palpable property according to the outward world.

35\. From Jupiter the sphere turns round, and out of the separation
Mercury proceeds forth with a broken metal, according to his spirit's
property; externally quicksilver, and internally he is a paradisical
working; he is in his spiritual property the distinguisher (or
articulator) of the words, voices, and speeches. It is written, "God
hath made all things by his word: "The heavenly eternal Mercurius is his
word, which the Father expresses in the enkindling of his light, and the
expressed is his wisdom; and the word is the worker, framer, and maker
of the formings in the expressed wisdom. Now what the inward Mercurius
does internally in God's power, that likewise the outward Mercurius
effects in the outward power in the created essence: He is God's
instrument, wherewith he works extrinsically to death and to life; in
each thing according to its property he builds, and breaks down.

36\. According to Saturn's property he builds, and according to his own
property he distinguishes and dissipates <span
id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) the hardness

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

in Saturn, viz. the enclosed, and opens it to life: He opens the
colours, and makes forms and shapes, and carries in him an heavenly, and
also an earthly property; in the earthly he carries out of the first
desire to nature, viz. out of Saturn, Mars, viz. the wrathfulness of the
impression; for he is his soul, wherein Mercury lives; he gives him the
fiery essence, and stands under Jupiter in the order upwards on the
sphere; for he carries the fire-spirit in Sulphur into all planets, and
forms and gives to each thing its source, and true spirit of life.

37\. Mars in the first impression is the great anguish, and causes the
love-will of the liberty to separate from him; and that which is
separated is called God; and the anguish, or fire-source, is called
God's anger, viz. the wrath of the eternal nature: And as internally
God's love separates from God's anger, that is, from the wrathful
property of the eternal nature, viz. heaven from hell, God from the
devil; so also it is effected in the birth of the outward nature.

38\. Love proceeds out of the wrath, and is an humility, or submission:
Thus likewise it came in the creation into order; therefore Venus stands
in the sphere on the line of Mars under the sun, for so is the
separation in nature; and so one proceeds forth from another: Its metal
is copper, the on final whereof is this, that the love is a desire, and
desires only light and joy; for the materia is made out of the desire's
property: But if the love-desire shall come to be corporeal in the
impression, then it must resign itself to the wrathful fiat, viz. to the
desire of Mars in the fire, or in the fiery property; for the saturnine
property takes all into its might, and makes it corporeal.

39\. Therefore the metal of Venus is so nearly related to gold, by
reason of her own property from the liberty, but Mars makes it too
wrathful; and because it separates itself out of Mars's fire, it retains
a great part of the property of Mars in it.

40\. Mars's metal is iron, for he is the wrath in Sulphur, in which the
fire enkindles, and arises; his original with the materia is in the
austereness of the desire: copper separates itself in the generation out
of iron, for it arises from the will of Venus, and they differ as body
and soul; for Mars is the fire-soul of Venus, and makes Venus corporeal;
otherwise Venus, as to her own property, gives only water in the
mortification in the salnitral flagrat; for her fire is only a pleasant
shining, smile, or love-fire, as she is alone void of other mixture; and
therefore she cannot produce any corporeal essence from her own power
and ability, which is hard and tough; she is only the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

mother <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) to her child without a
creaturely soul; Mars is her soul, and Saturn makes her body.

41\. The spirit of Sol may tincture Mars and Venus, and change them into
the highest metalline perfection, viz. into gold; which cannot so easily
be effected in silver, unless it be reduced into the first materia,
where Saturn, Mars, and Mercury are together in the Sulphur, and then it
can be done: Venus receives its toughness from Saturn, and its redness
from Mars as the fire.

42\. Now the desire of Venus is only eager, and longing after Sol, as
after her first mother, from whence she springs forth in her birth in
the first original; for the love comes forth originally from God, and so
it is likewise in the external birth in the figure: The desire of Venus
goes into Sol, into the sun, and receives in its desire the property of
the sun, and shines from Sol; she has a very peculiar shining and lustre
above all the planets and stars, which she receives from her mother; and
in her mother's power consists her joy, viz. the pleasant twinkling
smiling aspect which she has in her; she is in her own property (as she
is purely alone without the property of the other planets) a real
daughter of the sun (understand in Sulphur, where all is wrapt
together), therefore she stands next under the sun, as a child of the
sun; not that the sun did generate that star, for he is likewise created
with her, but in the Sulphur without the creation, merely in the
generation, it is so, both in the heavenly and earthly \[being, or
principle\].

43\. For God the Father generates the love through his heart; now the
sun, by way of similitude, betokens his heart; for it is a figure in the
outward world according to the eternal heart of God, which gives
strength and virtue to every life and essence.

44\. And understand it right; all things proceed from the word and heart
of God (which is the divine Sulphur) in the birth of the Holy Trinity,
and manifest themselves in and through the proceeded (or egressed)
essence, which is God's wisdom; and they again do eagerly force and
press out of the egress, in and towards his heart and power, and
vehemently long after it, as Paul saith, all creatures groan and pant
with us to be delivered from vanity.

45\. So also does the outward essence in the outward birth of metals,
planets, stars, and creatures; each thing longs after its centre, viz.
after its first mother, whence it proceeded, viz. after the sun in
Sulphur, for it is the tincture of all essences: Whatever the first
desire with the impression in Saturn makes evil

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

in the wrath of Mars, that the sun turns again into good. As the divine
sun tinctures the anger or wrath of God, so that the wrathful property
of God's anger is changed into a joyfulness; so likewise the outward sun
tinctures the outward Sulphur, viz. Saturn and Mars, that there is a
pleasant temperature, viz. a growth, springing, and blooming in all
metals and creatures; therefore the sun is the centre, which reason will
not believe; understand, in the planetary orb, and in all vegetables and
animals.
