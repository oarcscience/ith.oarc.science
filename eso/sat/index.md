If Signatura Rerum by the German mystic Jacob Boehme looks like a book
you'd find in the library at a certain school of wizardry, you're not
too far off. Boehme discourses at length here on one of the fundamental
laws of Magic: the law of signatures, the concept that every object in
the real world has some hidden meaning, and particularly how these
signatures interact.

At the core of Boehme's philosophy is a mystical Christianity. However,
his beliefs were far from that of the Lutheran establishment, and he was
persecuted his entire life. Boehme's view of a universe where a creative
and destructive principle are in conflict was later repurposed by Hegel
as the dialectic. Newton, Nietzsche, the Quaker George Fox, and even
Phillip K. Dick have all been cited as being influenced by Boehme.

NOTE: The English translation from the Latin appears to be from a much
older book, but the translator is uncredited. The introduction is signed
by one Clifford Bax, but he does not appear to have produced the
translation. Any help as to the identity of the translator would be
appreciated.--JBH.
