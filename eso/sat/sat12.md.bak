### CHAPTER VIII

<span class="small">OF THE FIERY SULPHUREOUS SEETHING OF THE EARTH, AND
HOW THE GROWTH IS IN THE EARTH; ALSO OF THE SEPARATION OF THE SEVERAL
KINDS OF CREATURES: AN OPEN GATE FOR THE WISE SEEKERS</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Let</span> the reader but consider what
before is written concerning the centre of the generation of all
essences, and then he may easily proceed here: All whatever is
corporeal, let it be either spirit or body, consists in a sulphureous
property; the spirit in such a spiritual property, and the body out of
the spirit in such a corporeal property.

2\. For all things are risen from the eternal spirit, as a likeness of
the eternal; the invisible essence, which is God and the eternity, has
in its own desire introduced itself into a visible essence, and
manifested itself in a time, so that he is as a life in the time, and
the time is in him as it were dead; <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) as a master that makes his work with an
instrument, and the instrument is mute to the master, and yet it is the
making, the master only guides it; even so are all things confined into
limit, measure, and weight, according to the eternal generation; and
they run on in their operation and generation according to the right and
property of eternity.

3\. And God has appointed over this great work only one master and
protector, which can alone manage the work, which is his officer, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) viz. the soul of the great world,
wherein all things lie; \[and\] he has appointed a type of its likeness
as the reason over this officer, which represents to the officer what he
is to do and make; and this is the understanding, viz. God's own
dominion wherewith he rules the officer: Now the understanding shews to
the officer what the property of each thing is, how the separation and
degrees proceed from each other; for all things are contained <span
id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131.md) in the sulphureous body, and Mercury is
Sulphur's life, and the salt is the impression, that preserves the
body <span id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132.md) from falling to ashes, so
that the spirit is known in a palpable essence.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

4\. The property of Mercury is in Sulphur, as the boiling of a water;
Sulphur is the water wherein Mercury seethes, and produces continually
two forms out of the water; viz. one oleous, living, from the liberty of
the divine power's property; and one mortal from the dissolution in the
fire in the salnitral flagrat.

5\. The oily is in stones and metals, herbs, trees, beasts, and men; and
the mortal \[property\] is in the earth, in the water, in the fire and
air; likewise the oleous property is in these four forms (viz. in the
earth, water, fire, and air) as a spirit or life, and these four
properties are as a dead body, in which the oil is a light or life, from
whence the desire, viz. the growth, arises as a springing out of the
dead property, which is the vegetative life, a springing, budding, and
growing out of death.

6\. But now the oily property could not be a life, if it were not in the
anguish of death; the anguish makes it to pullulate or move, in that its
will is to fly from, and press out of the anguish, and forces itself
eagerly forwards, from whence the growth arises: Thus must death be a
cause of the life, that the life may be stirring \[or active\], and
therefore Mercury is the true moving life.

7\. In the mortal property he is evil, and is called the life of death,
of hell, and the anger of God; and in the oily property he is good, from
the efficacy of the meekness and liberty of God; and he is the officer's
faber, whereby the officer distinguishes the degrees in the vegetative
life, \[separating\] the living \[being\] from the mortal, the heavenly
essentiality from the dead or earthly, and appoints it into two
kingdoms; viz. the good in the oleous \[property\] into a heavenly
\[being\], viz. into a light, and the mortal \[part\] into the darkness.

8\. These two kingdoms are in continual combat one with another, and
there is an incessant wrestling in them; as water boiling on the fire;
each boils in its property, viz. the oily in joy and meekness, and the
mortal in the anguish of darkness, and yet one is the cause of the
other: The light is the death, and deadly destruction of the darkness,
viz. of the anguish; for in the light the anguish has no strength, but
it changes it into the exultation of joyfulness, and the cause of joy,
else there would be no joy; for the meekness is like a stillness, but
the source of anguish sublimes it, and turns into a pleasant laughter:
So also the anguish, viz. the darkness, is the death and destruction of
the oily property; for if it gets the upper hand in the oleous property,
it takes possession of the corpus, <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md)
and turns the oil

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

into a poisonful source, viz. into a dark spirit, or body wholly
earthly, as Adam was when he imagined into the evil.

9\. And yet we do not acknowledge that the oleous property takes any
poison-source into itself; but Mercury, viz. the fire-life, insinuates
itself into the anguish, and poisons the essence of time, which the
outward Mercury itself makes in its own desire, that is, he departs from
the inward oleous essence, and then the internal \[being\] remains
immoveable in itself, and the essence and spirit of time do separate
from the essence and spirit of eternity, and yet there is no parting
\[or dividing\], but both principles remain in one essence; whereas
there are two essences, but the one comprehends not the other, as
eternity does not comprehend time: For thus also Adam and Eve died; the
soul's Mercury departed with its imagination from the essence of
eternity into the essence of time, viz. into the anguish-source, and
then the essence of eternity lost its leader, which Christ restored
again by the divine word, or Mercury; so that the essence of eternity,
which in Adam was forsaken by the soul's Mercury, obtained the life
again.

10\. And thus we know that the essence of eternity lies hid in the
anxious Mercury, as in the fortress of death; and our writing and
teaching are to chew how a man may bring the poisonful Mercury with its
desire so far, as to enter with its desire again into the essence of
eternity, viz. into the enclosed, and reassume the essence of eternity
for a body, and with the same tincture the essence of time, and
reconcile them in one, that the whole corpus of the inward and outward
world may be only one, that so there may be only one will in the spirit,
viz. a love-hunger; and this hunger does then make to itself only one
essence, and then every spirit eats of its \[own\] essence or body, so
that afterwards no evil will can arise any more therein.

11\. Thus we understand, that joy and sorrow, love and enmity, do
originally arise through imagination and longing; for in the inclination
\[or earnest desire\] towards God, viz. the free love, the kingdom of
joy arises in the midst of the anguish of death; and if the desire
departs out of the free love into the anguish of death, viz. into the
source of darkness, then is the desire filled with the source of death,
and so Mercury works effectually in the source of death.

12\. Thus we declare with a true ground, that there is nothing so bad,
but there lies a good therein, but the badness is not capable of the
good; also there lies in the most poisonful Mercury, the greatest pearl
and jewel; if his poisonful will may

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

be introduced into the same, <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) then
he himself manifests the pearl; for he changes himself; as is to be seen
in the earth, where Mercury seeks its pearl, and turns it in the
ore <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md) to gold, and to other metals,
according as the Sulphur is in each place.

13\. For there is a continual combat <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md) in the earth; the eternity travels with
longing through time to be free from vanity, and in its longing it gives
itself to Mercury, as to its life and faber; and when Mercury obtains it
in his hunger, he becomes joyful, and makes this free lubet corporeal in
him, and there arises gold and silver, together with other metals and
good herbs, all according to the powerful efficacy of each place; As the
boiling <span id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_137.md) is in each place, so
likewise is the metal, all according to the property of the seven forms
of nature; that form which is chief in a place, according to the same
property grows a metal, also herbs and trees.

14\. Here the physicians must observe, that they learn distinctly to
know what kind of property is the strongest in each thing with which
they would cure; if they do not know it, they will oftentimes give their
patients death: Also they must know, that they are to understand, and
very exactly know the property of the patient, which of the properties
among the seven forms of nature is the Mercury in Sulphur; for such a
salt he also makes: Now if the physician gives him a contrary salt,
Mercury is only thereby the more vehemently enraged, and made more
venomous; but if he may obtain his own salt according to his own
property (after which he hungers) then he <span
id="fr_138"></span>[5](#fn_138.md) rejoices, and readily quits the
poison-source in the fire of Mars. But the right physician has another
cure, he first brings his Mercury with which he will cure out of death's
anguish into the liberty: He may well cure, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_139.md) the other is dangerous and uncertain; if
he happens to cure, it is by chance, and very inconstant, and cannot
cure any disease fundamentally; for the outward Mercury is shut up, it
can reach no further than into the four elements, into the mortal
essence; it is able to do nothing in the sidereal body: But if it be
turned and introduced into the love, as is before mentioned, then it
touches <span id="fr_140"></span>[7](#fn_140.md) the very root and ground,
and renews it even to the divine power in the second principle.

15\. We have an excellent resemblance of this in the blooming earth on
the herbs; for in the earth Mercury is earthly and

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

venomous; but when the sun tinctures him., then he reaches after the
sun's power, after its light, and brings it into his hungry fiery
Mars-desire, into his salt, viz. into his corporeal essence, viz. into
Sulphur, which is his mother, and wheels it about with its rotation in
the essence, as if he also boiled; and then the liberty, viz. the
highest power, reaches after its property, viz. after the solar
property, and apprehends Mercury also along with it.

16\. Now when Mercury tastes the heavenly Being in itself, it grows
exceeding desirous after the power of love, and draws the same into its
desire, whereupon it changes itself, and its salt, so also its mother,
the Sulphur, into a pleasant source; and now if the liberty be so
introduced into a moving life with Mercury, then it is very full of joy,
and springs up in its joy, as a light from the fire, and puts forth
through the Sulphur-spirit in the salt: Thus is the growing of the root,
and from thence the root gets such a pleasant smell and taste; for in
the original the salt's sharpness in the first impression from Saturn is
a sharpness of death's anguish, and here it is turned to a pleasant
power; for all taste in herbs is salt.

17\. Thus understand us further about the root in the earth; when the
inward power of the liberty in Mercury's property, which now is changed,
does thus force itself forth to the manifestation of the Deity, then the
sun's power does eagerly press towards the divine power, and inclines
itself with great desire to the highest heavenly tincture, and draws it
with its desire to it; viz. out of the earthly body into a solar: Thus
the sun draws the power out of the root in the earth, and the joyful
Mercury ascends up along with it, and continually draws the sun's power
from above into itself, and from beneath it draws its mother viz. the
Sulphur, to itself: And here all the seven forms of nature arise in
joyfulness in the combat, each will be uppermost; for so it is in the
taste, viz. in the generation of nature; and what form in nature gets to
be the chiefest, according to the same taste is the salt in Sulphur, and
such an herb grows out of the earth, let it be what it will; though now
everything springs from its mother, yet all things have so taken their
original, and do still take it; for just so is the right of eternity.

18\. Now we are to consider of the stalk: When the herb or sprig looks
out of the earth, it comes up at first below with a white form, then
further more upwards with a brownish \[colour\], and above with a green
colour: This is now its signature, \[shewing\] what kind of form is
internally in the essence, in the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

source; the white colour of the branch <span
id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) is from the liberty of the love-lubet,
and the brown is the earthly \[property\] from Saturn's impression, and
from the wrath of Mars; and the green, which opens itself above, is
Mercury's in the form of Jupiter and Venus.

19\. For Jupiter is power, and Venus is love-desire, which hasten
towards the sun, as towards their likeness; and the heaven, which is
created out of the midst of the water, puts upon them its blue and
green-coloured garment according to the stars’ might; for the spirit of
the stars receives the new child also, and gives him its spirit and
body, and rejoices therein: Now the forms are in contest, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) and Mercury is the faber and separator;
Saturn impresses, and Jupiter is the pleasant power in sulphur; Mars is
the fire-source, viz. the might in sulphur; Venus is the water, viz. the
sweet desire; Mercury is the life, Luna the body, and Sol the heart,
viz. the centre to which all forms tend and press.

20\. Thus the outward sun presses into the sun in the herb; and the
inward sun presses into the outward, and there is a mere pleasing relish
and delight of one essence in another; Saturn makes four, Jupiter makes
a pleasant taste, Mars makes bitter, by reason of his anxious nature,
Venus makes sweet, Mercury distinguishes the taste, Luna takes it into
her sack and hatches it; for she is of an earthly and heavenly property,
and she gives it the menstruum wherein the tincture lies.

21\. Thus there is an instigation in the taste; each form hastens to the
sweet water and the sun; Jupiter is pleasant, and ascends up aloft with
the love-desire in the sweet source-water, wherein Mars rages, and
thinks himself to be master in the house, seeing that he rules the
fire-spirit in sulphur, at which Mercury is dismayed, that Mars does so
disquiet him, and Saturn makes the flagrat corporeal according to his
austere impression, and these are the knots upon the stalk; and the
flagrat is salnitral, according to the third form of nature in the first
impression to the spirit-life, viz. in the anguish-form, from whence the
sulphur takes its original, and in the flagrat Mercury goes up in the
salniter on the sides, and takes Venus also into it, viz. the
love-desire, from whence grow twigs and branches on the stalk, trunk, or
body, be they either herbs, trees, or shrubs; and each branch \[or
sprig\] is then like to the whole plant. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md)

22\. But the sun continually by little and little deprives Mars

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

of his force, whereupon the salniter extinguishes, and Mars loses his
bitter property; then Jupiter and Venus wholly yield themselves to the
sun in the moon's cabinet, <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) and the
outward sun takes full possession of the inward; understand the inward
sun is a Sulphur in Mercury, and is of the divine power's property, from
the liberty of God, which imprints itself on all things, and gives life
and power to all things. Now when that is done, that Jupiter and Venus
have given themselves to the power of the sun, then Jupiter forces no
more upwards, but Mars and Mercury do continually more and more wind up
the stalk from the earth on high; Jupiter stays still above in the
inward and outward sun's power, and there is the pleasant conjunction
with time and eternity, there the eternity beholds itself in an
image <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md) in the time.

23\. And paradise springs up \[or opens\], for the Sulphur and the salt
in the Sulphur are here transmuted in the paradise, and the paradisical
joy puts itself forth in the smell and taste. This is now the head or
knob of the blossoms, wherein the corn grows; the lovely smell is in one
part paradisical, viz. from the divine power, from the liberty; and on
the other part earthly, according to the outward sun, and the outward
world.

24\. The heavenly property sets forth its signature with fair colours of
the leaves on the blossoms; and the earthly \[represents its signature\]
by the green leaves \[or sprigs\] about the blossom; but seeing this
kingdom of the outward world is only a time (in which the curse is), and
Adam could not stand in paradise, the paradisical property soon passes
away with its signature, and changes itself into the corn which grows in
the blossom; therein the property of the inward and outward sun, viz. of
the inward and outward power, is couched, each property in its
principle; for God has cursed the earth, and therefore let none think
that the outward is divine, only the divine power penetrates and
tinctures the outward \[being\]; for God said, "The seed of the woman
shall bruise the serpent's head:" This is now effected after the curse
in all things which approach near the Deity, wherein Mercury is a
poison; there God bruises its head with the inward and outward sun, and
takes away the poisonful might in the anger.

25\. O that you would but learn to understand, dear sirs and brethren,
wherewith you are to cure; not with the angry Mercury, which in many an
herb is an evil poison-source, but with the inward Mercury: If you would
be called doctors and

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

masters, then you ought also to know how you may change the outward
Mercury in the Sulphur into love, that he may be delivered from the
anguish-source, and brought into a joyfulness, viz. that the earthly
\[being\] be turned into an heavenly, the death into life; this is your
doctorship in the right meaning, and not by the officer of reason only.

26\. God has placed man above the officer, and ordained him in the
understanding to his own dominion: He has ability to change nature, and
to turn the evil into good, provided that first he has changed himself,
otherwise he cannot; so long as he is dead in the understanding, so long
he is the servant and slave of the officer; but when he is made alive in
God, then the officer is his servant.

27\. Ye haughty caps, let it be told you; pride, and your own honour,
and the earthly lust of the flesh, lies in your way, so that you are not
masters in the mysteries, but blind children; you will not lay your
hands upon the coals, but you take money from the poor and distressed,
and give that to many an one which had been far better he had never
bought, for which you must give a severe and strict account.

28\. Thus it is likewise with the sulphurean seething in the earth with
the metals, the power <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) is stronger
in metals than in the herbs, the tincture is more heavenly than earthly,
if the artist affords it his help, then it changes itself, viz. the
earthly into an heavenly, which notwithstanding comes to pass in many
places without the artist's ingenuity; as we see, how Mercury in sulphur
apprehends the heavenly tincture in its boiling, whereby he changes his
made essence (which he makes in the sulphur) into gold and silver by the
power and efficacy of the tincture, understand, by that part of the
heavenly property; for out of the earth, or out of the mortified
property in the salniter, no gold can be made, for there is no fixedness
therein.

29\. Now we are thus to consider of this process of the boiling in the
Sulphur in the earth: Where the earth is in any place sulphureous in the
saturnine property, wherein the sun bears chief rule, there is such a
boiling; the outward sun hungers after the inward, which dwells in its
own principle in the centre in sulphur, and sets its desire upon time;
for the time, viz. the creature, longs after eternity, viz. after the
liberty, to be freed from vanity; as the Scripture says, that "all
creatures do earnestly long with us to be freed from vanity."

30\. Even here the liberty gives itself into the solar property

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

into the time, and when Mercury tastes it, he becomes joyful, and turns
his wheel in the joy; then Saturn impresses the meekness; and Mars,
which arises in the mercurial wheel in the impression, gives the
fire-soul thereinto, so that there is a driving forth and growth; for
the liberty puts itself forth in Mercury's property, and Mercury
continually separates Saturn and Mars from it; for he will have a fair
and pure child to his joy; he suffers Venus to remain on the child, for
she is in property akin to the child: copper is nighest to gold by
reason of the materia, it wants only the tincture; Mars holds him too
hard in possession; if he may be got out, then it is gold, which the
artist does well understand.

31\. After Venus Mars is akin to gold; for he has swallowed up Venus in
his wrath, and uses her for his body, else in his own peculiar property
he has no corporeal essence, for he is only wrath, which consumes: He
makes him a body out of the water of Venus, which he devours, and Saturn
makes it corporeal to him; therefore he does so defile his iron with
rust, and that is his property, viz. to be a devourer of his body; but
Venus is pleasant, and makes a growing in him, he devours again whatever
Venus's property makes in him; for Venus is the food of Mars in the
saturnine property; therefore the artist is to consider what lies in
Mars; if he has only the solar tincture, he needs nothing else thereto,
that he may but deprive Mars of his force, for Mars has his toughness
from Venus.

32\. Mars in his own peculiar property is only spalt, and causes
hardness. as the fire does; but Saturn is the impressure of all things;
Venus needs only the tincture, and then she is perfect; but the artist
must rightly understand where the possibility lies, viz. in Sulphur,
where Saturn has the Sulphur in his belly, and Mercury shews its colour,
there he is in the will, <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) but
cannot, for Saturn holds him too fast imprisoned; but if the artist
gives him his helping hand, that he may but advance his wheel, and give
him his mother's food, which she has hid in the centre, then he grows
strong, and casts Saturn away, and manifests the child: For so it is
also in the earth, where Mercury is quick in his mother, viz. in the
Sulphur, that he is not withheld, that he may only reach Venus in his
hunger for food, the sun will soon shine forth, for she beams forth in
Venus's meekness: He dresses \[or seethes\] his food with his own fire,
he needs no artist thereto; which the artist must well observe, for he
has his Mars in himself.

33\. Now as the boiling is in the earth, so also it is above the

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

earth; when the fruit grows out of the earth, it is first sharp
\[astringent\] and bitter, also sour and unpleasant, as the apple upon
the tree is so; for Saturn has at first the dominion, he attracts it
together, and Mercury forms it, and Mars gives the fire to Mercury,
which Saturn receives into his cold property, Venus gives the sap, and
Luna takes all into her body, for she is mother, and receives the seed
of all the planets into her menstruum, and hatches it; Jupiter gives
power thereinto, and Sol is king therein, but at the first Sol is weak;
for the materia is too earthly and cold. Now the whole essence in its
boiling lies in the body <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) of
Sulphur; and in the Sulphur the salnitral flagrat makes a salt in Mars's
wheel according to each property; for the Sulphur turns into salt, that
is, into taste; and in the same taste there is an oil hid in the centre
in the sulphureous property, which \[oil\] arises from the free
love-lubet, viz. out of eternity, and manifests itself with an external
essence in the time, which is the manifestation of God.

34\. Now in this same oil is the hunger or love-desire after the essence
of time, viz. after the manifestation of the Deity; this desire reaches
in the essence of time after its property, viz. after the sun, and the
sun's property reaches after the oil in the centre of the fruit, and
fervently longs after it, and gives itself freely into the fruit, and
sucks the virtue into itself, and gives it forth in its joy into the
austere property of the fruit, and meekens and sweetens all with the
love, which it receives in the centre in the oil of the liberty: Thus a
fruit, which at first is sour and sharp, becomes very pleasant and
sweet, that a man may eat it; and even thus is the ripening of all
fruits.

35\. Now by the signature in the external you may see the inward form;
for the forms in the salt, viz. in the power, shew themselves
externally.

36\. There are commonly four colours, as white, yellow, red, and green:
Now according to what colour the fruit (as an apple) is most signed,
accordingly is the taste also in the salt; as white with a clear thin
skin somewhat inclining to dark gives sweetness, which is of Venus
property; if the sweet taste be strong and powerful, then Jupiter is
potent therein; but if it be weak and fulsom, then the moon is strong
therein; but if it be hard, and of a brownish colour, then Mars is
strong therein; but if the white colour be of a grayish-brown, then
Saturn is strong therein: Venus makes <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) a white colour, Mars red, and bitter in
the taste; Mars makes Venus's colour light, Mercury gives a mixt colour,

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

and opens the green in Mars; Jupiter inclines to blue, Saturn to black,
almost gray; the sun makes the yellow colour, and gives the right
sweetness in the salt, and casts forth the pleasant smell, which takes
its rise from Sulphur; Saturn makes astringent \[sharp\] and sour; and
each property represents itself externally, as it is internally in the
dominion, so also by the form \[or signature\] of the leaf, or branches.

37\. Every root, as it is in the earth, may be known by the signature
for what it is good or profitable, even such a form also has the earth,
and it is discerned in the leaves and stalks which planet is lord in the
property, much more in the flower; for of what taste the herb and root
is, even such an hunger is in it, and such a cure lies therein, for it
has such a salt. The physician must know what kind of sickness is risen
in the body, and in what salt the loathing is risen in Mercury, that so
he may not administer a further loathing \[and nausea\] to his patient;
for if he gives him the herb, in whose property Mercury has before
received a loathing, then he ministers poison to him; so that the poison
in the loathing of the body does exceedingly inflame itself in Mercury,
unless he burns that herb to ashes, and gives it him; then the poison of
the loathing loses its might; for these ashes are a death to the poison
of the living Mercury.

38\. This we find very effectually in the magic; this also the physician
must know, that all sicknesses arise from the loathing in the form of
nature: As when one form in the life is superior, if then a contrary
thing quite opposite to its property be by force introduced into it, let
it be either from the stars, or from the elements, or from the seven
forms of life, then it deprives this superior \[or chiefest\] form
(which is the leader and ruler of the life) of its strength and power in
its salt; then the Mercury of this superior form begins effectually to
work, that is, to hunger and loath; and if he gets not his own peculiar
property, understand the bodily form, which is chief in the body among
the seven properties or forms, then he enkindles himself in his own
poison-source according to his vital <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) property, and does so forcibly strive so
long, till he becomes fiery, and then he awakes his own Mars, and his
own Saturn, which impress him, and consume the flesh of the body in the
poison-fire, and wholly consume the oil of light; even then the life's
light goes out, and it is past recovery.

39\. But if the form of life, wherein <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) Mercury is inflamed in the
loathing <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md) in the anguish and
poison-source, may obtain

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

that property into its hunger, of which the spirit and body is chief,
then he obtains his own natural food, of which he lives, and does again
rejoice, and puts away the nauseate, <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) and then the nauseate dissipates \[or
dissolves\] and is spewed out; but the physician must have a care,
whether or no that thing which he will administer to his patient be in
its property strong also in the same essence, from whence the nauseate
is risen in the body.

40\. As for example; A jovial man receives a nauseate \[or loathing\]
from the lunar property; now if the physician knew that he had so gotten
his nauseate, and prepared him a jovial cure according to the hunger of
his own spirit or mercury, this now would be right; but if the moon's
property be strong in the salt which he would administer for the
nauseate, then he gives him a nauseate; but if the jovial cure be free
from the moon, then the jovial Mercury receives its own food with great
desire, and quits the nauseate: And thus it is likewise with diseases
which arise in the salniter, viz. from fear or frightening; thereto
belongs also such a flagrat as the first was, and then there is a
present cure, or such an herb, wherein the salniter lies in such a
property as it lies in that man.

41\. I know, and it is shewn me, that the sophister will cavil at me,
because I write, that the divine power is in the fruit, that God's power
does appropriate <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md) itself into the
generation of nature: But hear, my dear friend, become seeing, I ask
thee, How was paradise in this world? Was it also manifest in nature?
Was it also in the fruit? Was it in the world, or without the world? Did
paradise stand in God's power, or in the elements? Was the power of God
manifest in the world, or hidden? Or what is the curse of the earth, and
the putting of Adam and Eve out of paradise? Then tell me, Does not God
dwell also in time? Is not God all in all? It is written, "Am not I he
who filleth all things?" Also, "Thine is the kingdom, the power, and
glory, from eternity to eternity."

42\. Here consider thyself, and leave me uncensured: I do not say, that
the nature is God, much less the fruit proceeding from the earth; but I
say, God gives power to every life, be it good or bad, to each thing
according to its desire, for he himself is All; and yet he is not called
God according to every being, but according to the light wherewith he
dwells in himself and shines with his power through all his beings; He
gives in his power to all his beings and works, and each thing receives
his power

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

according to its property; one takes darkness, the other light; each
hunger desires its property, and yet the whole essence \[or being\] is
all God's, be it evil or good, for from him and through him are all
things, what is not of his love, that is of his anger. Paradise is yet
in the world, but man is not therein, unless he be born again of God;
then as to that new regeneration he is therein, and not with the Adam of
the four elements. O that we would but once learn to know ourselves, and
even understand it by the created essence \[or being\].

43\. Lo! in Saturn there lies gold shut up in a very disesteemed and
contemptible form and manner, which indeed resembles no metal; and
though it be cast into the fire and melted, yet a man shall have
nothing, but a contemptible matter void of any form of virtue, till the
artist takes it in hand, and uses the right process about it, and then
it is manifest what was therein.

44\. So likewise God dwells in all things, and the thing knows nothing
of God; he likewise is not manifest to the thing, and yet it receives
power from him, but it receives the power according to its property from
him, either from his love, or from his wrath; and from which it
receives, so it has its signature <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)
externally; and the good is also in it, but as it were wholly shut up
\[or hidden\] to the iniquity \[or evil\]; an example of which you have
in bushes, and other thorny and pricking briars, out of which
notwithstanding a fair well-smelling blossom grows; and there lie two
properties therein, viz. a pleasant and unpleasant; which overcomes,
that shapes \[forms or marks\] the fruit.

45\. Thus also it is with man; he was created a fair blossom and fruit
of paradise, but the devil raised up in him his thorny property by the
serpent, understand the centre, the property of the wrathful nature,
which in his paradisical source was not manifest in him; but when his
hunger entered into the thorny false property of the serpent, viz. into
death, then the property of death, and the false serpent in the devil's
desire, pressed into his hunger, and filled soul and body, so that the
hunger of the false serpent began effectually to work in him, and death
awaked in him, and then paradise hid itself in him: For paradise entered
into itself, and the poison of the serpent in death's property dwelt
also in itself; here was now the enmity; then said God to him, "The seed
of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head, and thou shalt sting the
heel with death's poison."

46\. Understand the paradisical image which is shut up, and

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

captivated in the wrathful death, in which the word of the Deity, viz.
the divine Mercury, ruled and wrought, did disappear; as the gold is
disappeared in Saturn, so that nothing is seen but a contemptible
matter, till the right artist sets upon it, and again awakens the
Mercury in the inclosed gold, and then the dead inclosed body of the
gold does again revive in Saturn; for Mercury is its life, who must be
introduced into it again, and then the dead body of the gold
appears, <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) and overcomes the gross
Saturn, wherein it lay shut up, and changes its mean contemptible old
body into a fair glorious golden body.

47\. Thus likewise it is with man; he lies now shut up after his fall in
a gross, deformed, bestial dead image; he is not like an angel, much
less like unto paradise; he is as the gross ore in Saturn, wherein the
gold is couched and shut up; his paradisical image is in him as if it
were not, and it is also not manifest, the outward body is a stinking
carcass, while it yet lives in the poison: He is a bad thorny bush, from
whence notwithstanding fair rose-buds may bloom forth, and grow out of
the thorns, and manifest that which lies hidden, and shut up in the
wrathful poisonful Mercury, till the artist who has made him takes him
in hand, and brings the living Mercury into his gold or paradisical
image disappeared and shut up in death; so that the inclosed image,
which was created out of the divine meekness and love-essentiality, may
again bud and spring forth in the divine Mercury, viz. in the word of
the Deity, which entered into the humanity shut up \[and closed in the
death and curse\].

48\. And then the divine mercury changes the wrathful Mercury into its
property, and Christ is born, who bruises the head of the serpent, viz.
of the poison and death in the anger of God, understand the might of
wrathful death; and a new man arises in holiness and righteousness,
which lives before God, \[and his divine image\] appears and puts forth
its lustre as the hidden gold out of the earthly property: And hereby it
is clearly signified to the artist chosen of God how he shall seek; no
otherwise than as he has sought and found himself in the property of the
pure gold; and so likewise is this process, and not a whit otherwise;
for man and the earth with its secrets lie shut up in the like \[or
same\] curse and death, and need one and the same restitution.

49\. But we tell the seeker, and sincerely and faithfully warn him as he
loves his temporal and eternal welfare, that he do not first set upon
this way to try the earth, and restore that which

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

is shut up \[in death\], unless he himself be before born again through
the divine mercury out of the curse and death, and has the full
knowledge of the divine regeneration, <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) else all that he does is to no purpose,
no learning \[or studying\] avails; for that which he seeks lies shut in
the curse, in death, in the anger of God: If he will make it alive, and
bring it into its first life, then that life must be before manifest in
him, and then he may say to the mountain, "Get thee hence, and be cast
into the sea;" and to the fig-tree, "No fruit grow on thee henceforth;"
and it shall come to pass; for if the divine mercury lives, and is
manifest in the spirit, then when the spirit of the soul's will imagines
into anything, Mercury also goes along with it in the imagination, and
enkindles the Mercury fast apprehended in death, viz. the similitude of
God, or the manifestation, with which the living God has made himself
manifest.

50\. I know and see, that the mocker in the devil's vizard will yet
bring my writing into a misapprehension, and make me more dark and
doubtful, because I write of the inward and outward Mercury, and
understand by the inward the word of God, or the divine voice, viz. the
manifestation of the eternity of the abyss; and by the outward
\[mercury\] I understand the officer in nature, viz. the instrument,
which the inward, living, powerful word, or divine voice uses, wherewith
it forms <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158.md) and works. Now the
sophister will falsely interpret it, and say, that I mix them both
together, making no difference, and hold <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) nature for God, as Babel has already
done to me: But I bid him view my words well, and learn to understand
them right; for I speak sometimes from the heavenly Mercury, and see
that only, and then presently I name the instrument of the heavenly,
therefore let him have regard to the sense: I write not heathenishly,
but theosophically, from a higher ground than the outward faber <span
id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_160.md) is, and then also from the same.
