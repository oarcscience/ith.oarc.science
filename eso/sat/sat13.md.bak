### CHAPTER IX

<span class="small">OF THE SIGNATURE, SHEWING HOW THE INTERNAL SIGNS THE
EXTERNAL</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">The</span> whole outward visible world with
all its being is a signature, or figure of the inward spiritual world;
whatever is internally, and however its operation is, so likewise it has
its character externally; like as the spirit of each creature sets forth
and manifests the internal form of its birth by its body, so does the
Eternal Being also.

2\. The Being of all beings is a wrestling power; for the kingdom of God
consists in power, and also the outward world, and it stands especially
in seven properties or forms, where the one causes and makes the other,
and none of them is the first or last, but it is the eternal band;
therefore God has appointed six days for man to work, and the seventh
day is the perfection wherein the six do rest; it is the centre to which
the desire of the six days tend; therefore God calls it the Sabbath or
resting-day, for therein the six forms of the working power rest: It is
the divine sound <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) in the power, or
the kingdom of joy, wherein all the other forms are manifest; for it is
the formed world, or divine corporality, by which all things are
generated and come forth to a being. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md)

3\. This formed world has manifested itself with the motion of all forms
with this visible world, as with a visible likeness, so that the
spiritual being might be manifest in a corporeal comprehensive essence;
as the desire of the inward forms has made itself external, and the
internal being is in the external; the internal holds the external
before it as a glass, wherein it beholds itself in the property of the
generation of all forms; the external is its signature.

4\. Thus everything which is generated out of the internal has its
signature; the superior form, which is chief in the spirit of the
working in the power, does most especially sign the body, and the other
forms hang to it; as it is to be seen in all living creatures, in the
shape and form of the body, and in the behaviour and deportment, also in
the sound, voice, and speech;

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

and likewise in trees and herbs, in stones and metals; all according as
the wrestling is in the power of the spirit, so is the figure of the
body represented, and so likewise is its will, so long as it so boils in
the life-spirit.

5\. But if the artist takes it in hand with the true Mercury, then he
may turn the weakest form to be uppermost, and the strongest undermost,
and then the spirit obtains another will, according to the most superior
form; that which before must be servant becomes now lord and master in
the seven forms; as Christ said to the sick, "Arise, thy faith hath made
thee whole," and they arose: And thus likewise it is here, each form
hungers after the centre, and the centre is the voice of life, viz. the
Mercury, the same is the faber or former of the power; if this voice
gives itself into the hunger of the meanest form in the strong
combat <span id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_163.md) then it lifts up its
property (understand the property of that form), and thus its desire or
faith has saved it; for in the desire Mercury lifts up \[or sublimes\]
itself; and thus it was in Christ's patients.

6\. Sickness had taken possession of them, and the poison of death had
gotten the upper hand in Mercury; but now the form of life in the centre
did set its hunger as a famished and mean property after the liberty to
be freed from the abomination; but seeing the Mercury was revived in
Christ the divine property, therefore the weak hunger entered into
Christ's strong hunger after the salvation of man, and so the weak
hunger received the strong in the power; and then the divine voice in
Christ said, "Arise, lift up thyself, thy faith" (that is, thy desire
which thou hast introduced into me) "hath saved thee."

7\. Thus the life prevails over the death, the good over evil; and on
the contrary, the evil over the good, as came to pass in Lucifer and
Adam, and still daily comes to pass: And thus everything is signed; that
form which is chief receives the taste, and also the sound in Mercury,
and figures <span id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_164.md) the body after its
property; the other forms hang to it as co-helpers, and also give their
signature thereto, but very weakly.

8\. There are especially seven forms in nature, both in the eternal and
external nature; for the external proceed from the eternal: The ancient
philosophers have given names to the seven planets according to the
seven forms of nature; but they have understood thereby another thing,
not only the seven stars, but the sevenfold properties in the generation
of all essences: There is not anything in the Being of all beings, but
it has the

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

seven properties in it; for they are the wheel of the centre, the cause
of Sulphur, in which Mercury makes the boiling in the anguish-source.

9\. The seven forms are these; viz. the desire of the impression is
called Saturn, into which the free lubet of eternity gives itself; this
in the impression is called Jupiter, by reason of its pleasant
commendable virtue; for the saturnine power encloses and makes hard,
cold, and dark, and causes the Sulphur, viz. the vital spirit,
understand the moving vital spirit, viz. the natural; and the free lubet
makes the impression to long to be freed from the dark astringent
hardness, and it is very rightly called Jupiter, being a desire of the
understanding <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) which opens the
darkness, and manifests another will therein.

10\. In these two properties is pourtrayed and exactly deciphered God's
kingdom, viz. the original, and also the kingdom of God's anger, viz.
the dark abyss, which is a cause of the motion in Saturn, viz. in the
impression; the impression, viz. Saturn, makes the nothing, viz. the
free lubet movable and sensible, and also opposite, for it causes it to
be essence; and Jupiter is the sensible power proceeding from the free
lubet to manifestation out of the nothing into something, in the
impression of Saturn; and they are two properties in the manifestation
of God according to love and anger, viz. a model of the eternal form,
and are as a wrestling combat, viz. an opposite desire against each
other; one makes good, the other evil, and yet it is all good; only if
we will speak of the anguish-source, and then also of the joyful source,
then we must distinguish, that the cause of each source may be
understood.

11\. The third form is called Mars, which is the fiery property in the
impression of Saturn, where the impression introduces itself into great
anguish, viz. into a great hunger; it is the painfulness, or the cause
of feeling, also the cause of the fire and consuming, also of enmity and
malignity; but in Jupiter, viz. in the free lubet, in the nothing, it
causes the fiery love-desire, that the liberty, viz. the nothing, is
desirous, and introduces itself into sensibility, viz. into the kingdom
of joy: In the darkness it is a devil, viz. God's wrath, and in the
light it is an angel of joy, understand such a property; for when this
source became dark in Lucifer, he was called a devil, but while he was
in the light he was an angel; and thus also it is to be understood in
man.

12\. The fourth property or form is called Sol, viz. the light of

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

nature, which has its original in the liberty, viz. in the nothing, but
without splendour, and gives itself in with the lubet into the desire of
the impression of Saturn, even to the wrathful or fiery property of
Mars; and there the free lubet, which has sharpened itself in the
impression, in the property of Mars, in the consuming anguish, and in
the hardness of Saturn, displays, or powerfully puts itself forth in
Jupiter, as a sharpness of the liberty, and an original of the nothing,
and also of the sense; <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md) and the
effluence <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md) from the heat and
anguish of Mars, and from Saturn's hardness is the shining of the light
in nature, which gives the understanding in Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars,
viz. a spirit, which knows what itself is in its properties, which
hinders or prevails against the wrath, and brings it out of the anguish,
out of the property of Mars, into Jupiter's, viz. out of the anguish
into a love-desire.

13\. In these four forms the spirit's birth consists, viz. the true
spirit both in the inward and outward being, viz. the spirit of power in
the essence; and the essence or corporality of this spirit is Sulphur.

14\. Ye rabbies and masters! that you could but understand, how
faithfully that is given and revealed to you, which your predecessors
have intended and aimed at, wherein you have been a long time blind, the
cause of which is your pride: This God, the most high understanding,
sets before you by mean, and heretofore ungrounded instruments, which he
himself has grounded, if you would yet once see, and escape the
tormenting source.

15\. The fifth form is Venus, the beginning of all corporality, viz. of
the water, which arises in the desire of Jupiter and Mars, viz. in the
love-desire, out of the liberty, and out of nature, viz. out of the
impression's desire in Saturn, in Mars, in the great anguish, to be
freed from the anguish: And it carries two forms in the desire of its
property, viz. a fiery from Mars, and a watery \[property\] from
Jupiter, understand an heavenly and earthly desire; the heavenly arises
from the heavenly impression of the union \[or free effluence\] of the
Deity in nature to its own manifestation; and the earthly arises from
the impression of the darkness in Mars, viz. in the wrathful fire's
property; therefore the essence of this desire consists in two things,
viz. in the water, from the original of the liberty, and in Sulphur from
the original of nature according to the impression.

16\. The outward similitude of the heavenly \[Being\] is water

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

and oil; understand, according to the sun it is water, and according to
Jupiter it is oil, and according to the hard impression of Saturn after
the heavenly Being according to Mars, it is copper, and according to Sol
gold, and according to the earthly impression, according to the property
of the darkness, it is in Sulphur grit, gravel and sand; according to
the property of Mars a cause of all stones; for all stones are Sulphur
from the powerful predominance of Saturn and Mars in the property of
Venus according to the dark impression, understand according to the
earthly part.

17\. O ye dear wise men! if you did but know what lies in Venus, you
would not so sumptuously adorn your roofs: The potentate often loses his
life for the servant's sake, and he puts the master upon his roof,
therefore he is blind; this his false Venus-desire causes in him, that
he forms it in Saturn and Mars, and brings it forth in Sol; if he formed
his Venus-desire in Jupiter, then he might rule over the fiery Mars
which lies in Venus, and has put his coat upon Venus in Sulphur.

18\. Thus Mars clothes all his servants which love him and Saturn with
his garment, that they only find the copper of Venus, and not its gold
in the copper; the spirit of the seeker enters into Sol, viz. into
pride, and supposes that he has Venus, but he has Saturn, viz.
covetousness; if he went forth in the water, viz. in the resigned
humility of Venus, the stone of the wise men would be revealed to him.

19\. The sixth form is Mercury, viz. the life and separation, or the
form in the love, and in the anguish: In Saturn and Mars, on the one
part he is earthly according to the hard impression, where his motion
and hunger is a pricking, adverse, and (according to the fire) a bitter
pain and woe; and according to the water in the earthly Sulphur, viz. in
the mortification, a poison-source.

20\. And according to the other part, according to the lubet of the
liberty, he is the pleasant property of joy in Jupiter and Venus, also
of springing and growing; and according to the impression of the
heavenly Saturn, and according to Mars in the love-desire, he is the
sound in the spirit, understand, the separator of the sound, viz. of the
tone; also of all pronunciations of speeches, and all the several cries
and notes; all whatever sounds is distinguished by his might; Venus and
Saturn carry his lute, and he is the lutanist, he strikes <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md) upon Venus and Saturn, and Mars gives
him the sound from the fire; and thus Jupiter rejoices in Sol.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

21\. Here lies the pearl, dear brethren: Mercury makes the understanding
in Jupiter, for he separates the thoughts, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md) and makes them act and move; he takes
the infinity of the thoughts into his desire, and makes them essential;
this he does in Sulphur, and his essence is the manifold power of the
smell and taste, and Saturn gives his sharpness thereinto, so that it is
salt.

22\. But I understand here the virtual salt in the vegetable life:
Saturn makes the common salt in the water: He <span
id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170.md) is an heavenly and an earthly labourer,
and labours in each form according to the property of the form; as it is
written, "With the holy thou art holy, and with the perverse thou art
perverse." In the holy angels the heavenly Mercury is holy and divine,
and in the devils he is the poison and wrath of the eternal nature
according to the dark impression's property, and so on through all
things, as the property of each thing is, so is its Mercury, viz. its
life; in the angels he is the hymn of God's praise, and in the devils he
is the cursing and awakening of the opposite will of the bitter
poisonful enmity.

23\. Thus likewise it is to be understood in men and all creatures, in
all whatever lives and moves; for the outward Mercury is the outward
word in the outward world: He <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171.md) is
the outward verbum, and Saturn with the impression is his fiat, which
makes his word corporeal; and in the inward kingdom of the divine power
he is the eternal word of the Father, whereby he has made all things in
the outward \[principle\], understand, with the instrument of the
outward Mercury.

24\. The outward Mercury is the temporal word, the expressed word; and
the inward \[Mercury\] is the eternal word, the speaking word; the
inward word dwells in the outward, and makes through the outward all
outward things; and with the inward, inward things: The inward Mercury
is the life of the Deity, and all divine creatures; and the outward
Mercury is the life of the outward world, and all external corporality
in men and beasts, in vegetables and animals, and makes a peculiar
principle, viz. a likeness of the divine world; and this is the
manifestation of the divine wisdom.

25\. The seventh form is called Luna, the amassed essence: What Mercury
has comprised in Sulphur, that is a corporeal or substantial hunger of
all forms; the property of all the six forms lies therein, and it is as
a corporeal being of all the rest; this property is as a wife of all the
other forms; for the other forms do all cast their desire through Sol
into Luna; for in Sol they

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

are spiritual, and in Luna corporeal: Therefore the moon assumes to it
the sunshine, and shines from the sun; whatever the sun is, and makes in
the spirit-life in itself, the same Luna is, and makes corporeal in
itself.

26\. It is heavenly and earthly, and rules the vegetative life; it has
the menstruum, viz. the matrix of Venus in it; all whatever is corporeal
does congeal <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_172.md) in its property;
Saturn is its fiat, and Mercury is its husband, which impregnates it,
and Mars is its vegetable soul, and the sun is its centre in the hunger,
and yet not wholly in the property; for it receives only the white
colour from the sun, not the yellow, or the red, viz. the majestic;
therefore in its property lies silver in metals, and in the property of
Sol gold; but seeing Sol is a spirit without essence, thereupon Saturn
holds the sun's corporeal essence in himself to lodge in; for he is the
fiat of the sun; he keeps it shut up in his dark cabinet, and does only
preserve and keep it; for it is not his own essence, till the sun sends
him his faber Mercury, to whom he gives it, and to none else.

27\. Observe this, ye wise men! It is no fiction or fallacy; let the
artist but understand us right; he must bring the jewel shut up in
Saturn into the mother of generation, viz. into Sulphur, and take the
faber, and divide all forms, and separate the variety of hungers, which
the faber himself does, when the artist brings the work into the first
mother, viz. into Sulphur: But he must first baptize the froward child
with the philosophical baptism, lest he makes a bastard of Sol; and then
let him lead him into the desert, and try whether Mercury will eat manna
in the desert after the baptism; or whether he will make bread of
stones; or whether he will aspire aloft as an haughty spirit, and
precipitate himself from the Temple; or whether he will worship Saturn,
in whom the devil sits hidden: This the artist must observe; whether
Mercury, the wicked poisonful child, receives the baptism; whether he
can feed of God's bread or no.

28\. If he now does eat, and stands out in the temptation, then will the
angels appear to him after forty days, and then let him go out of the
desert, and eat his own food; and so the artist is ready and fit for his
work; if not, then let him by all means leave it, and as yet account
himself unworthy of it.

29\. He must have the understanding of the generation of nature; else
all his labour and pains are to no purpose, except the grace of the Most
High has bestowed upon him some particular, that so he is able to
tincture Venus and Mars, which is

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

the shortest \[and most ready way\], if God chews him such an herb
wherein the tincture lies.

30\. The lunar body of metals lies in the seething of the earth, in
Sulphur and Mercury, covered internally with the coat of Venus, and
clothed externally with the cloak of Saturn, as we see plainly, and is a
degree more external than the solar body: Next after Luna, Jupiter's
body is also a degree more external; but Venus is a sly bird, she has
also the inward solar body; she takes the coat of Mars upon her, and
hides herself in Saturn's cabinet; but she is manifest, and not hidden.

31\. Next Venus Mars is likewise a degree more external, and nearer to
earthliness; and next Mars Mercury's body is a *particula* of all the
rest; on one part most nigh to the earthly corporality, and on the other
part nearest the heavenly; and next Mercury Luna is on the earthly part
wholly earthly, and on the heavenly part wholly heavenly; it carries an
earthly and heavenly face towards all things; <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) to the evil it is evil, and to the good
it is good; to a pleasant creature it gives its best in the taste, and
to a bad creature it gives the curse of the corrupted earth.

32\. Now in all this, as the property of each thing is internally, so it
has externally its signature, both in animals and vegetables; and this
you shall see in an herb, so likewise in trees and beasts, and in men
also.

33\. If the saturnine property be predominant, and chief in a thing,
then it is of a black, greyish colour, hard and spare, sharp, sour, or
salt in taste; it gets a long lean body, <span
id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_174.md) grey in the eyes, <span
id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_175.md) of a dark blue, of a very slender body,
but of a hard touch, though the property of Saturn is very seldom alone
master in a thing; for he soon awakens Mars with his hard impression,
who makes his property bending and crooked, full of knots, and hinders
the body from growing high, but is full of branches and rugged, as is to
be seen in oak-shrubs, and the like trees.

34\. But if Venus be next to Saturn <span
id="fr_176"></span>[4](#fn_176.md) in any place in the sude or seething of
the earth, then the sude in the Sulphur of Saturn causes a tall strong
body; for it gives its sweetness into Saturn's impression, whereby
Saturn becomes strong and lusty, and if Venus be not hindered by Mars,
it grows a great, tall, slender tree, herb, beast, or man, or whatever
it be.

35\. But if Jupiter be next to him in the property of Venus,

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

so that Jupiter is stronger in Saturn than Venus, and Mars under Venus,
then it falls out to be a very excellent fair body, full of virtue and
power, also of a good taste; its eyes are blue, and somewhat whitish, of
a meek property, but very potent: If it falls out that Mercury is
between Venus and Jupiter, and Mars undermost, then is this property in
Saturn graduated in the highest degree with all power and virtue, in
words and works, with great understanding.

36\. If it be in herbs, then they are long, of a middle-sized stature or
stalk, of a very curious form, fair blossoms, white, or blue; but if the
sun also casts the influence of his property into it, then does its
colour by reason of the sun incline to yellow; and if Mars hinders not,
then is the universal very sovereign in the thing, be it either a man,
or other creature, or an herb of the earth: This let the magus well
observe, it withstands all malignity, and false influences and assaults
from the spirits, whatever they be, so far as a man himself is not false
and wicked, and inclines not his desire to the devil, as Adam did, in
whom also the universal was wholly complete.

37\. With these herbs a man may cure, and heal without any art of the
artist; but they are rarely and seldom found, yea not one among many
sees them, for they are nigh to paradise: The curse of God hides the
eyesight of the wicked, that it does not see, although they should stand
before his eyes: Yet in such a conjunction of the planets they are
manifest, and may not be hidden; therefore there lies a great secret in
many an herb and beast, if the artist knew it, and had the true skill to
use it; the whole magia lies therein: But I am bidden to be silent by
reason of the wicked, who is not worthy of it, and is justly plagued
with the plague with which he plagues other honest people, and tumbles
himself in the mire.

38\. But if Mars in his property be next Saturn, and Mercury casts an
opposite aspect, and the power of Venus be under Mars, and Jupiter under
the property of Venus, then out of this property all is corrupted and
poisoned; a poisonful herb, tree, beast, or whatever it be; if it falls
into the corrupt human property, then it is fitted and prone to evil,
but if the moon brings its powerful influence thereinto, then is the
false magia ready in the lunar menstruum, and witchcraft is manifest, of
which I must here also be silent, and will only shew the signature.

39\. In an herb, if the blossom be somewhat reddish, and wreathed, or
streaked, and inclined to white by the red, then is the power of Venus
there, which makes resistance therein; but

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

if it be only reddish, and of dark wriths or streaks, with a rough peel
or skin on the stalk, branch, and leaf, then does the basilisk lodge
there.

40\. For Mars makes it rugged, and Mercury is poisonful therein, which
gives a streaked colour, and Mars the red, and Saturn the dark, which is
a pestilence in the lunar menstruum; but to the artist it is an herb
against the pestilence, if he takes the poison from Mercury, and gives
him Venus and Jupiter for food, then Mars brings forth the vegetable
soul in Sol, and turns his wrathful fire into a love-fire, which the
artist must know, if he will be called a doctor.

41\. This property likewise signs the living creatures both in their
voice and visage; it gives a gross, dull sound, somewhat inclining to a
shrill voice by reason of Mars, soothing, flattering, and very false,
lying, commonly red pimples \[or streams\] in the eyes, or blinking, and
rolling unsteady eyes: In herbs this property likewise yields a taste
very loathsome, from whence in man's life, viz. in Mercury, if it takes
it down, a stirring boiling poison arises, which darkens and obscures
the life.

42\. The physician must have a care of the herbs of this property; they
are not to be taken into the body, but they are poisonful, of what name
soever they be; for there often happens such a conjunction of the
planets, which sometimes so prepares an herb, which is good if it be
subject to Saturn and Mars: So likewise it falls out sometimes, that an
evil herb, by reason of a good conjunction, if in its beginning it
stands in the menstruum, may be freed from the malignity, which is to be
known by the signature; therefore the physician, who understands the
signature, may best of all gather the herbs himself.

43\. But if Mars be next Saturn, and Mercury very weak, and Jupiter also
under Mars in the property, and Venus casts an opposite aspect or
dissent with its desire, then it is good; for Jupiter and Venus change
the wrath of Mars into joy, which produces hot wholesome sovereign
herbs, which are to be used in all hot diseases and hurts; the herb is
rough, and somewhat prickly the leaves on the branches; so likewise the
stalk is fine and thin, according to the nature of Venus, but the virtue
and power is of Mars and Jupiter, well mixed and tempered, commonly with
brownish blossoms forcing forth in the property, and that because Mars
is strong therein with his wrath; but seeing his wrath is changed by
Jupiter and Venus into a pleasant property, the wrath becomes a desire
of joy.

44\. The physician must not give Saturn without Mars in hot

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

diseases, not cold without heat, else he enkindles Mars in the wrath,
and stirs <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177.md) up Mercury in the hard
impression in the property of death; Mars belongs to the cure of every
Mars-like sickness, which is of heat, and pricking pangs: But let the
physician know, that he must first correct and qualify Mars, which he
intends to administer, with Jupiter and Venus, that the wrath of Mars
may be changed into joy, and then he will also change the sickness in
the body into joy; cold is quite contrary to it.

45\. If the physician administers Saturn only and by itself to a martial
disease or hurt, then Mars is dismayed with death, and falls down with
his force and strength into death's property; and now seeing he is the
fire in the body, the life's fire becomes thereupon deadly in the
elemental property; for he soon awakens Mercury in the property of cold:
But yet the physician must have a care that he administers not in an hot
disease the raw undigested hot Mars, in which Mercury is wholly inflamed
and burning; for he enkindles the fire more vehemently in the body; he
must first mollify Mars and Mercury, and put them into joy, <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178.md) and then it is right and good.

46\. The hotter an herb is, the better it is hereunto; yet its wrathful
fire must be changed into love, and then he can also change the wrath in
the body into joy; all according as the property of the disease is, that
the disease be able to bear it; for to a weak fire in the body, which is
tired and languished by reason of the heat, and rather inclines to cold,
viz. to the poison of Mercury, where the life is in danger, there
belongs a cure with a fine subtle heat, wherein Venus is strong, and
Mars very tender and mild by reason of the power of Venus; Jupiter need
not be strong there, lest he make Mars and Mercury too strong, so that
the weak life, before it is quickened and refreshed, is overwhelmed, and
brought into the mercurial poison.

47\. An herb in this aforesaid property grows not high, it is somewhat
rough in the touch; the rougher it is, the stronger is Mars therein; it
is better to be used outwardly to wounds and sores, than inwardly: The
fine and subtle part is to be taken into the body, and is expulsive; the
more subtle it is, the nigher it is to the life in the body, which the
physician may very well know by its salt; for no rough wild property is
to be taken into the body, unless the body be inflamed with a sudden
poison, where the life also is fresh and strong, then a vehement
resistance must be used; yet Mercury and Mars must not be administered

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

in the wrath, but in their strongest power, Mars in the greatest heat,
but before changed into joy; and then he also changes Mercury according
to himself: Jupiter belongs to the transmutation of wrathful Mars, but
he must be first introduced into Sol's property, and then he is rightly
fit for it.

48\. Every living creature, according to its kind in the foregoing
property, is friendly and pleasant, if you deal friendly and gently with
it; but if it be dealt roughly with, then Mercury is stirred up in the
poison-property, for Mars soon boils up, and gets aloft in the bitter
property, and then the anger springs forth; for the ground of all
malignity lies therein; but if it be not stirred up, then it is not
manifest; as a great sickness which lies in the body, but while the same
is hid, and not enkindled, it is not manifest and apparent.

49\. But if Mercury be next Saturn in the property, and next him the
moon, and Venus and Jupiter beneath, and also weak, then let Mars stand
where he will, yet all is earthly; for Mercury is held in the austere
impression in the cold property, viz. in death's form, and his Sulphur
is earthly; if Mars comes near to it, then it is poisonful also, but if
Venus makes an opposition therein, then the poison is resisted, yet it
is but earthly; it gives a greenish colour from the power of Venus.

50\. But if Venus be next Saturn in the property, and the moon not
opposed by Mars, and Jupiter likewise goes in his own power, then all is
pleasant \[and lovely under that property or constellation\]; the herbs
are slender, single, and soft in touch, of white blossoms, unless
Mercury brings in a mixt colour from the power of the sun, viz. from
Mars half red, and from Jupiter bluish, and it is weak in the property,
and of little use in physic, yet not hurtful: In the creature it gives a
pleasant, courteous, humble life, with no deep reason \[reach or
capacity\], but if Mars comes thereunto, the creature is small, or thin,
of a white, weak, and effeminate nature.

5i. There are three special salts which may be used to cure, which
belong to the vegetable life, viz. Jupiter, Mars, and Mercury; these are
the working life, in which the sun is the right spirit which makes these
salts operative. <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md)

52\. The salt or power of Jupiter is of a pleasant good smell and taste
from the inward original \[of the property\] of the liberty of the
divine essence, and from the external \[principle or original\] of the
property of the sun and Venus, but yet it is not alone of itself of
sufficient power in nature; for the outward

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

nature consists in fire and anguish, viz. in poison, and Jupiter's
power <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180.md) is opposed to the fiery
poison life, which makes a temperature in the poisonful nature, viz. a
desire of meekness out of the enmity.

53\. \`the salt of Mars is fiery, bitter, and austere, and the mercurial
salt is anxious and raging, like a poison, inclined both to heat and
cold; for it is the life in Sulphur, and unites \[or assimilates\]
itself, according to each thing's property; for if it comes into
Jupiter's salt, it causes joy and great power; but if it comes into
Mars's salt, it makes bitter pangs, stitches, achings, and woe; but if
it comes into Saturn's earthly salt, it makes swellings, anguish, and
death, if it be not hindered by Jupiter and Venus: Venus and Jupiter are
opposite to Mars and Mercury, that so they might temper them both; and
without the power of Mars and Mercury there would be no life in Jupiter,
Venus, and Sol, but only a stillness; "therefore the worst is as
profitable as the best," and the one is the cause of the other.

54\. But the physician is to heed and mind what he takes in hand, lest
he inflame the mercurial poison more and more in his patient, or
introduce it into another adverse source: He ought indeed to use the
martial and mercurial salt for his cure, but he must first reconcile
Mars and Mercury with Venus and Jupiter, that so both these angry
adversaries may resign their will into Jupiter's will, so that Jupiter,
Mars, and Mercury may all three obtain one will in the power, and then
the cure is right, and the sun of life will again enkindle itself in
this union and agreement, and also temper the nauseate of the disease in
the contrariety in the salt of the disease, and turn Mercury's poison,
and the bitter fire of Mars into a pleasant Jupiter.

55\. This is now to be understood only concerning the vegetable soul,
viz. concerning the outward man, which lives in the four elements, and
concerning the sensible and feeling property.

56\. Reason likewise is to be cured with its likeness; for as reason may
be brought by words into a sensible sickness and disease, so that reason
may vex, fret, and torment itself, and at last fall into an heavy sad
sickness and death; so also it may be cured with the application of the
same thing \[with its own assimilate\].

57\. As for example: An honest man falls into great debts, care, trouble
and distress, which does even afflict him nigh to death; but if a good
friend comes and pays his debt for him, then is the cure soon effected
with its likeness: Even thus it is

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

in all things; from whence the disease is risen, even such a like cure
is requisite for the restoring its health; and thus it is likewise in
the mental soul.

58\. The soul of the poor sinner is poisoned in the anger of God, and
the Mercury (understand the eternal Mercury in the eternal nature) is
inflamed in the soul's property in the fiery Mars of God's anger, which
does now burn in the eternal Saturn, viz. in the horrible impression of
darkness, and feels the sting of the poisonful angry Mars; his Venus is
imprisoned in the house of misery, his water is dried up, his Jupiter of
understanding is brought into the greatest folly, his sun is quenched,
and his moon turned to dark night.

59\. Now he cannot be cured and remedied any other way, but with the
likeness; he must again appease the mental Mercury; he must take Venus,
understand the love of God, and introduce it into his poisonful Mercury
and Mars, and tincture the Mercury in the soul again with love, and then
his sun will again shine in the soul, and his Jupiter will rejoice.

60\. Now if thou sayest that thou canst not, and that thou art too
strongly captivated; I say also, that I cannot; for it lies not in my
willing, running, and toiling, but it lies in the compassion of God; for
I cannot by my own strength and ability overcome the wrathful anger of
God which is enkindled in me; but seeing his dear heart has freely given
itself again out of love, and in love, into the humanity, viz. into the
poisonful enkindled Mercury in the soul, and tinctured the soul, viz.
the poison-source of the eternal nature in the eternal Father's nature's
property; therefore I will cast my will into his tincture, and I will go
with my will out of the enkindled poison-source, out of the evil Mercury
in God's anger into his death, and with my corrupted will I will die
with him in his death, and become a nothing in him, and then he must be
my life.

61\. For if my will is a nothing, then he is in me what he pleases, and
then I know not myself any more, but him; and if he will that I shall be
something, then let him effect it; but if he wills it not, then I am
dead in him, and he lives in me as he pleases, and so then if I be a
nothing, then I am at the end, in the essence out of which my father
Adam was created; for out of nothing God has created all things.

62\. The nothing is the highest good, for there is no *turba* therein,
and so nothing can touch \[or annoy\] my soul; for I am a nothing to
myself, but I am God's, who knows what I am; I know it not, neither
shall \[or ought\] I to know it.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

63\. And thus is the cure of my soul's sickness; he that will adventure
it with me shall find by experience what God will make of him: As for
example; I here write, and I also do not do it; for I, as I, know
nothing, and have also not learned or studied it; so then I do it not,
but God does it in me as he pleases.

64\. I am not known to myself, but I know to him what and how he
pleases: Thus I live not to myself, but to him; and thus we are in
Christ only one, as a tree in many boughs and branches, and he begets
and brings forth the fruit in every branch as he pleases, and thus I
have brought his life into mine, so that I am atoned with him in his
love; for his will in Christ is entered into the humanity in me, and now
my will in me enters into his humanity; and thus his living Mercury,
that is, his word, viz. the speaking Mercury, tinctures my wrathful evil
Mercury, and transforms it into his. And thus my Mars is become a
love-fire of God, and his Mercury speaks through mine, as through his
instrument, what he pleases; and thus my Jupiter lives in the divine
joy, and I know it not; the true sun shines to me, and I see it not; for
I live not to myself, I see not to myself, and I know not to myself: I
am a thing, and I know not what; for God knows what I am; and so now I
tend and run to and fro as a thing, in which the spirit drives \[or
actuates\] me as he pleases; and thus I live according to my inward
will, which yet is not mine.

65\. But yet I find in me another life, which I am, not according to the
resignation \[or self-denial\], but according to the creature of this
world, viz. according to the similitude of eternity; this life does yet
stand in poison and strife, and shall yet be turned to nothing, and then
I am wholly perfect: Now in this same life, wherein yet I find my
selfhood, is sin and death, and these likewise shall be brought to
nothing: In that life, which God is in me, I hate <span
id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_181.md) sin and death; and according to that
life which yet is in my selfhood, I hate the nothing, viz. the Deity:
Thus one life fights against the other, and there is a continual contest
in me; but seeing Christ is born again in me, and lives in my
nothingness, therefore Christ will, according to his promise made in
paradise, bruise the head of the serpent, viz. of my selfhood, and
mortify the evil man in myself, so that he himself may truly live \[in
me\].

66\. But what shall Christ do with the evil man? Shall he cast him away?
No. For he is in heaven, and does thereby

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

accomplish and effect his wonders in this world, which stands in the
curse: Now each labours in its own \[vineyard\]; the outward man labours
in the cursed world, which is evil and good in the wonders of God, viz.
in the mirror of glory, which yet shall be revealed in him; and the
inward man is not its own, but God's instrument, with whom God makes
what he pleases, till the outward with its wonders in the mirror shall
also be manifest in God; and even then is God all in all, and he alone
in his wisdom and deeds of wonder and nothing else besides; and this is
the beginning and the end, eternity and time.

67\. Now understand it right; to the outward man there belongs a cure
from the outward, viz. from the outward will of God, who has made
himself external with this visible world; and for the inward man there
is a cure from the inward world, in which God is all in all; only one,
not many, one in all, and all in one: But if the inward penetrates the
outward, and illustrates it with its sunshine, and the outward receives
the sunshine of the inward, then it is tinctured, cured, and healed by
the inward, and the inward illustrates it, as the sun shines through the
water, or as the fire sets the iron quite through of a light glee; here
now needs no other cure.

68\. But seeing the devil in the wrath of the eternal nature opposes the
soul, as an enemy of the soul, and continually casts his poisonful
imagination at the soul to tempt and try it, and the anger or wrath of
the eternal nature is manifest in the outward man, which Adam awakened
and stirred up; thereupon this wrath is oftentimes stirred up by the
devil and his servants, that it effectually works and burns in the
outward body, and even then the inward love-fire goes out in the outward
man, as a red-hot iron is quenched in the water; yet not so soon in the
internal, but in the external \[man\], unless the outward man continues
lying in the mire <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) of sin; so that
the soul, which had given itself into the nothing, viz. into the
liberty, into the life of God, does enter again with its desire into the
outward sinful man, then it loses the inward sun; for it goes again out
of the nothing into the something, viz. into the source.

69\. Thus the outward body must then have an outward cure; and though
the inward man yet lives in God, yet whereas the soul has imagined into
the outward wrath, so that the divine tincturation is no longer in the
outward man, the outward Mercury, viz. the expressed <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) word, must have a tincturation

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

from the outward expressed love and light, unless the will-spirit of the
soul does wholly re-enter into the inward hidden man, and be again
transmuted; <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) and then the cure may
be again introduced into the outward man, being the thorough-shining
love of God in the light, <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) which is
exceeding precious.

70\. But now this herb is rarely to be found upon the earth; for men eat
only of the forbidden tree; therefore the poison of the serpent does so
spring up in them in the wrath of the eternal and external nature, so
that they must also have an external cure for their serpent's poison in
the outward Mercury.

71\. It is indeed possible for a man to live without sickness, but he
must bring the divine tincturation from the inward man through the
outward, which is very difficult \[to do\] in the world; for the outward
man lives among the thorns of God's wrath, which gall and sting him on
every side, and blow up the wrath of God, so that it burns in the
outward man, and then the tincturation of God's love may not continue
there: It is indeed inhere, but not in the outward enkindled
abominations, but it dwells in itself, like as the light dwells in the
darkness, and the darkness comprehends it not, also knows nothing of it;
but when the light is manifest in the darkness, then is the night
changed into day.

72\. Thus it is likewise with man; of what light man lives, of that also
comes his cure; if he lives in the outward world, then the outward
goodness and love, viz. the outward Jupiter and Venus with the sun must
be his cure, or he remains in the angry Mars, and in the poisonful
Mercury, in the earthly moon captivated in the impression of Saturn,
viz. in the earthly Sulphur; which however is made manifest, and
awakened in the outward man by Adam, for whose sake the outward man must
die, putrify, and so enter again into the nothing, viz. into the end, or
as I might better say and signify it, into the beginning of the
creation, into the essence, out of which it went and departed with Adam.
