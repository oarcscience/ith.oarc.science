It was as if Satan was walking the streets of New York... -- New York
Firefighter, regarding 9/11/2001

Evil is, on one level, a cultural construct. The Easter Islanders
believed that stealing, if successful, was virtuous. This was probably a
social mechanism for redistributing scarce items on a small island.
However some evils--war, genocide, and terrorism to name a few--are
instantly recognizable as such. The issue of why an omniscient,
all-powerful God would permit such horrors is one of the most difficult
(and obvious) religious questions. This section of sacred-texts deals
with this thorny issue.

Note that there aren't any sacred texts of Satanism *per se* at this
site. Satanism as an organized religion is a very recent phenomena, and
books about it are a long way from entering the public domain. Besides,
to put a fine point on it, actual Satanists insist that they aren't
evil.
