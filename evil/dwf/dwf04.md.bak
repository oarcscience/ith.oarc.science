### CHAPTER II

#### THE MASK OF MASONRY

THE identification of the cultus of Lucifer with devil-worship pure and
simple is not, as we have seen, at first sight an entirely just
proceeding, but at the same time it is inevitable. As already observed,
the source of all our knowledge concerning Modern Diabolism exists
within the pale of the Catholic Church; the entire literature is written
from the standpoint of that church, and has been created solely in its
interests. Some of that literature has been put forth with the special
marks of high ecclesiastical approbation, and to some this guarantee is
wanting, but the same spirit informs the whole. To insist on this point
is important for many reasons which will become apparent at the close of
our enquiry, and for one which concerns us now. It is impossible for the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Catholic Church to
do otherwise than brand the cultus of Lucifer as identical with that of
Satan, because, according to her unswerving instruction, the name
Lucifer is an equivalent of Satan, and, moreover, the Luciferian cultus
is so admittedly anti-Christian that no form of Christianity could do
otherwise than regard it as a worship of darkness and evil. While,
therefore, the adoration of a good principle under this discredited name
may in one of its aspects be merely an error of judgment, and not the
worship of a devil, apart from other facts which destroy this
consideration, we must all agree that from the standpoint of Christian
and Latin orthodoxy the Luciferian is a diabolist, though not in the
sense of the Satanist.

The doctrine of Lucifer has been tersely described by Huysman as a kind
of reversed Christianity---a Catholicism *à rebours*. It is, in fact,
the revival of an old heresy founded on what we have most of us been
accustomed to regard as a philosophical blunder; in a word, it is a
Manichæan system having a special anti-Christian application, for while
affirming the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

existence of two equal first principles, Adonaï and Lucifer, it regards
the latter as the god of light and goodness, while the Christian Adonaï
is the prince of darkness and the veritable Satan. It is inferred from
the condition of the world at the present time that the mastery of the
moment resides with the evil principle, and that the beneficent Deity is
at a disadvantage. Adonaï reigns surely, as the Christian believes, but
he is the author of human misery, and Jesus is the Christ of Adonaï, but
he is the messenger of misfortune, suffering, and false renunciation,
leading ultimately to destruction when the *Deus maledictus* shall cease
to triumph. The worshippers of Lucifer have taken sides in the cause of
humanity, and in their own cause, with the baffled principle of
goodness; they co-operate with him in order to insure his triumph, and
he communicates with them to encourage and strengthen them; they work to
prepare his kingdom, and he promises to raise up a Saviour among them,
who is Antichrist, their leader and king to come.

Such is the doctrine of Lucifer according to

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

the testimony of witnesses who have come out from his cultus; it is not
an instruction which *à priori* would seem likely to commend itself to a
numerically powerful following, but the society which is concerned with
its propagation is affirmed to have spread over the whole world, and to
be represented in all its chief cities. It is that which we have already
found mentioned by M. Huysman as possessing a demonstrated existence and
being a proof positive of modern Satanism, namely, the Palladian Order.
Having broadly ascertained its principles, our next course is to
discover its alleged history, and here it is necessary to admit that it
is a matter of some difficulty to place the position in such an aspect
that it will be a tolerable subject for inquiry among readers in
England.. The mystery of modern Diabolism and the Cultus of Lucifer is a
part of the mystery of Masonry as interpreted by an Anti-Masonic
movement now at work in France. The black magic, of which we hear so
much, involves a new aspect of the old Catholic Crusade against the
Fraternity of the Square and Compass, and by the question

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

of Lucifer is signified an alleged discovery that Masons diabolise.

Now, we are all well acquainted with the historical fact that the Latin
Church has long been hostile to Masonry, that popes have condemned the
order, and have excommunicated its initiates. Having regard to the
position of the brotherhood here in England, most of us have been
content to infer in this respect that the ripe old age of the Church is
passing into a second childhood; some, however, have concluded that
there may be more in Continental Freemasonry than meets the English eye,
and here the Church herself comes forward to assure them that the
fraternity abroad is a hotbed of political propaganda, and is
responsible for the most disastrous revolutions which have perplexed the
modern world; that it is actually, as the exploded Robison described it,
a conspiracy against crowned heads; and that it is at the present time
the most potent, most secret enemy which checkmates and hinders herself.

It is now further affirmed that behind the Masonry of to-day—here in
England posing as

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

a benefit society, and political or not upon the Continent, but
everywhere disclaiming any connection with a religious propaganda—there
is affirmed to be another Masonry, of which the ordinary Mason knows
nothing, secretly directing the order, and devoted to the cultus of
Lucifer. This organisation, which has sprung up within recent years, is
largely, though not exclusively, recruited from Masonry; it works
through the powerful Masonic apparatus, and, according to the evidence
which has been put in, it has obtained a substantial and masterful
control over the entire Fraternity. It has focussed the raw material of
Masonic hostility towards the Catholic Church; as it is anti-Christian
in religion, so is it revolutionary in politics; and once more, it is
called the Palladian Order.

This exceedingly grave and important accusation, together with its side
issues, has perhaps all the more claim on our consideration because,
apart from actual diabolism, which is in itself so paralysing as almost
to arrest discussion, it conflicts with all that we know or believe
concerning the Masonic constitution. Let me briefly collect

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

the points. (*a*) Masonry possesses a secret directing centre—which has
been strenuously denied by the Fraternity. (*b*) It has a religious
mission and a doctrinal propaganda—which has also been invariably
denied. (*c*) It is concerned with political objects—which, for the most
part, is denied. (*d*) It has a transcendental teaching—which is
generally denied, and (*e*) is concerned largely with transcendental
practices and phenomena—which would be denied absolutely, had the
question been seriously raised till this day. (*f*) It initiates
women—which, except in a very secondary, occasional, and insignificant
manner, is *in toto* and at all times denied. The last point is brought
within the scope of our inquiry because the Palladium is an androgyne
order.

Now, it will be fairly well known to many who are not within the ranks
of the fraternity that the Grand Lodges of every country are supposed to
be autonomous, and that there has been no previous impeachment of this
fact; that, ostensibly at least, there is no central institution to
which they are answerable in Masonry. Individual lodges derive from a
single Grand Lodge

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

and are responsible thereto, but Grand Lodges themselves are supreme and
irresponsible. It will be known also that the Masonic system in England
differs from that of France, that the French rite has always occupied a
somewhat heterodox position, and that since the Grand Orient expunged
the Grand Architect of the Universe, so to speak, from its symbolism,
official communication has been suspended by the Grand Lodge of England.
It will be known further that outside recognised Masonic systems many
rites have arisen which are only Masonic to the extent that their point
of departure is from the Master-grade. As a special instance may be
cited the Supreme Oriental Rite of Memphis and Misraim. In England the
Lodge meetings of these rites are never suffered to take place in the
great central institution of Freemasons Hall; in France, the Grand
Orient has consistently forbidden its members to participate in the
Memphis system. To hold Masonry responsible for irregularities or abuses
which from time to time may obtain in these fantastic developments from
the parent institution, would

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

be about as just and reasonable as to impeach the Latin Church on the
score of corruptions now existing in the heresies which have separated
from her.

Having established these points in view of the result of our inquiry,
let us now trace the manner in which a supreme authority, frequently
termed by the accusers Universal Masonry, is alleged to have grown up.
Upon this subject not only the most complete information but the only
formal narratives are provided by the later witnesses, so that the
following account, while in no sense translation, is based exclusively
upon the works of Domenico Margiotta and Dr Bataille.

On the 20th of May, 1737, there was constituted in France the Order of
the Palladium, or Sovereign Council of Wisdom, which, after the manner
of the androgyne lodges then springing into existence, initiated women
under the title of Companions of Penelope. The ritual of this order was
published by the Masonic archæologist Ragon, so that there can be no
doubt of its existence. At the same time, so far as I am aware, there
are few materials forthcoming for

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

its history. In some way which remains wholly untraceable this order is
inferred to have been connected by more than its name with the legendary
Palladium of the Knights Templars, well known under the title of
Baphomet. In any case it failed to spread, and it is uncertain whether
the New and Reformed Palladium, also an androgyne order, with which we
shall presently be concerned, is a metamorphosis or reconstruction of
the original institution, but a connection of some kind is affirmed. For
a period exceeding sixty years we hear little of the legendary
Palladium; but in 1801 the Israelite Isaac Long is said to have carried
the original Baphomet and the skull of the Templar Grand Master Jacques
de Molay from Paris to Charleston in the United States, and was
afterwards concerned in the reconstruction of the Scotch Rite of
Perfection and of Herodom under the name of the Ancient and Accepted
Scotch Rite, which subsequently became widely diffused, and it is stated
that the lodge of the thirty-third degree of the Supreme Council of
Charleston has been the parent of all others, and is therefore, in

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

this rite, the first supreme council of the entire globe.

Eight years later, on the 29th of December 18.09, a man of great
importance to the history of Freemasonry was born in the city of Boston.
Albert Pike came of parents in a humble position, who, however,
struggled with their difficulties and sent him to Harvard College, where
he duly graduated, taking his degree as M.A. in the year 1829. He began
his career as a schoolmaster, but subsequently led a romantic and
wandering life, his love of un-trodden ground leading him to explore the
Rocky Mountains, then very imperfectly known. In 1833 he settled in
Arkansas, and, drifting into journalism, founded the *Arkansas
Advocate*, wherein his contributions, both prose and verse, but the
latter especially, obtained him a reputation in literature. The
admission of Arkansas into the confederation of the United States was in
part his work, and from this period he began to figure in politics,
becoming also the recorder of the Supreme Court in that state. One year
after the civil war, in which he

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

took active part, Pike removed to Memphis in Tennessee, where he again
followed law and literature, establishing the *Memphis Appeal*, which he
sold. in 1868, and migrated to Washington. His subsequent history is
exclusively concerned with unwearying Masonic labours.

Now, it was at Little Rock in Arkansas that Albert Pike was first
initiated, and ten years later, that is, in 1859, he was elected
Sovereign Commander Grand Master of the Supreme Council of Charleston.
Having extraordinary powers of organisation, he became a person of wide
influence in the Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite, and a high authority
also on the ritual, antiquities, history, and literature of Masonry.
Under his guidance, the Scotch Rite extended and became dominant. Hence,
when the Italian patriot Mazzini is said to have projected the
centralization of high grade Masonry, he could find no person in the
whole fraternity more suited by his position and influence to
collaborate with him. Out of this secret partnership there was begotten
on September 20, 1870—that is to say, on the very

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

day when the Italian troops entered the Eternal City—a Supreme Rite and
Central Organisation of Universal High Grade Masonry, the act of
creation being signed by the American Grand Master and the Italian
liberator, the two founders also sharing the power between them. A
Supreme Dogmatic Directory was created at Charleston, with Pike at its
head, under the title of Sovereign Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry.
Mazzini took over the Supreme Executive, having Rome as its centre,
under the title of Sovereign Chief of Political Action.

If we now recur to the statements that the genuine Templar Baphomet and
the skull of Jacques de Molay had been deposited at Charleston for the
space of seventy years, and that Albert Pike was Grand Master of the
Supreme Council of the Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite in that city, we
shall understand why it was that the new institution was termed the New
Reformed Palladian Rite, or the Reformed Palladium. Subsequently, five
Central Grand Directories were established—at Washington for North
America, Monte Video for South America,

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Naples for Europe, Calcutta for the Eastern World, and Port Louis in
Mauritius for Africa. A Sovereign Universal Administrative Directory was
fixed at Berlin subsequently to the death of Mazzini. As a result of
this astute organisation, Albert Pike is said to have held all Masonry
in the hollow of his hand, by means of a twofold apparatus—the Palladium
and the Scotch Rite. During all his remaining days, and he lived to a
great age, he laboured indefatigably in both causes, and the world at
the present moment is filled with the organisation that he administered.

"Four persons are cited as having been coadjutors in his own country—his
old friend Gallatin Mackey, in honourable memory among masons; a
Scotchman named Longfellow, whom some French writers have ludicrously
confused with the poet; one Holbrook, about whom there are few
particulars; and, finally, Phileas Walder, a native of Switzerland,
originally a Lutheran Minister, afterwards said to have been a Mormon,
but, in any case, at the period in question, a well known spiritualist,
an

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

earnest student of occultism, as were also Holbrook and Longfellow, and,
what is more to the purpose, a personal friend and disciple of the great
French magus Éliphas Lévi. Albert Pike was himself an occultist, whether
upon his independent initiative, or through the influence of these
friends I am unable to say. Miss Diana Vaughan, who is one of the
seceding witnesses, affirms that it was an early and absorbing passion.
However this may be, the New Reformed Palladium was kept most rigidly
separate from all other Masonry, the Scotch Rite included; that is to
say, no initiate of even the highest grade had, as such, the right or
opportunity of entrance into the occult order, which, at the same time,
was chiefly recruited, as already stated, from the higher ordinary
grades, but the recipients of the new light became silent from the
moment that it was imparted. Now, it was exclusively in the Palladian
order that Albert Pike and his confidants propagated transcendental
religion, as it is said to have been understood by them. In other words,
while the Scotch Rite continued to

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

speculate, the Palladium betook itself to magic and succeeded so well
that there was a perpetuity of communication between Charleston and the
unseen world. It does not appear from the evidence either when or why
Albert Pike and his collaborators transferred their allegiance from the
God of the sages to Lucifer. The Catholic Church regards all magic as
diabolism, and makes or tolerates no mystic distinction. between the
black and white departments of transcendental practice, but the specific
character of the Palladian cultus is so clearly defined in the
depositions that it cannot pass as a presentation of magical doctrine
distorted by prejudice. It is almost stripped of correspondence with any
existing school of occult teaching, and it is either the true statement
of a system founded. by Pike, or the deliberate invention of malice. The
thaumaturgic phenomena tabulated in connection therewith are of an
extremely advanced kind, including the real and bodily presence of
Lucifer at frequent and regular intervals.

When Mazzini died he indicated to Albert

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pike a possible
successor in Adriano Lemmi, who became in due course the chief of the
Executive Department; and when in the fulness of years the pontiff of
Luciferian Freemasonry himself passed on to the higher life of fire,
which is the Palladian notion of beatitude, and in the peace and joy of
Lucifer, the sovereign pontificate itself, after resting for a short
period upon incompetent shoulders in the person of Albert George Mackey,
was transferred to the Italian; the seat of the Dogmatic Directory was
removed to Rome; a split in the camp ensued, inspired by a lady
initiate, since famous under the name of Diana Vaughan, and to this we
owe most of the revelations. Furthermore, with the death of Albert Pike
the cultus of Lucifer is said to have undergone a significant
transfiguration. For him the conception of Satan was a blasphemous.
fiction, devised by Adonaïte priestcraft to obscure the veridic lustre
which inheres in the angel of the morning-star; but this view
represented, as it is said, rather the private opinion of the masonic
pontiff, impressed by his strong personality on the lodges

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

he controlled, and propagated. by the instruction of his rituals. The
more discerning among his disciples regarded it as the besetting
weakness of their grand old man, and surreptitiously during his
life-time the cultus of Satan pure and simple, that is, of
devil-worship, the adoration of the evil principle, as evil, was
practised at numerous Palladian centres. After his death, it is said to
have unmasked altogether, and Adriano Lemmi himself is depicted as an
avowed Satanist.

Now, I believe it will fairly interpret the feeling of all readers to
admit that when the authority of a great church has been brought into
operation to crush a great institution by charges which most seriously
discredit it—which represent it as diametrically and in all respects
opposite in its internal nature to its ostensible appearance—we must by
no means make light of the impeachment; we must remember the high
position and the many opportunities of knowledge which are possessed by
such an accuser; we must extend to that accuser at least the common
justice of an impartial

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

and full hearing; *à priori* considerations of probability and
inferences from our previous knowledge, much less from opinions obtained
at second-hand, must not be permitted to prejudge a case of so great
importance; we must be prepared, if necessary, to admit that we have
been egregiously deceived; and if the existence of Palladian Masonry can
be proved an undoubted fact, we must assuredly do full honour to the
demonstration, and must acknowledge with gratitude that the Church has
performed a service to humanity by unveiling the true character of an
institution which is imposing on a vast number of well-intentioned
persons within its own ranks, who are admittedly unaware of the evil to
which they are lending countenance and support. On the other hand, the
same spirit of liberality and justice will require that the
demonstration in question shall be complete; in support of such terrible
accusations, only the first quality of evidence can obviously be
admitted.

In the chapters which follow immediately, I shall produce in succession
the evidence of every

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

witness who has anything to tell us about Palladism, including those
whose experience is of a personal kind and those whose knowledge is
derived. Where possible, the testimony of each witness will be weighed
as we proceed; what is unconvincing or irrelevant will be dismissed,
while that which is important will be carried over to the final summary.
In two cases only will it be found necessary to reserve examination for
special and separate treatment.
