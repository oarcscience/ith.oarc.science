### CHAPTER V

#### THE DISCOVERY OF M. RICOUX.

BY the year 1891 Masonic revelations in Paris had become too numerous
for one more or less to fix the volatile quality of public interest
unless a new horror were attached to it. Passwords and signs and
catechisms, all the purposes and the better half of the secrets—everyone
outside the Fraternity who concerned themselves with Masonry and cared
for theoretical initiation knew these, or was satisfied by the belief
that he did. The literature of Anti-Masonry became a drug in the market,
failing some novelty in revelation. The last work of Leo Taxil was
eminently a contribution towards this missing quantity. He was already
in a certain sense the discoverer of "Female Freemasonry," that is to
say, he was the only equipped person who seriously maintained that the
exploded androgyne

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

system was worked in modern France, and when he added the development of
the Palladium as the climax to the mystery of iniquity, it is small
wonder that his book achieved notoriety to the extent of five thousand
copies: He was assailed as a venal pamphleteer and his past achievements
in literature were freely disinterred for his own benefit and for public
instruction, but he was more than compensated by the approbation of Mgr.
Fava, bishop of Grenoble, with whose opinions upon Satanism in Masonry
we have previously made acquaintance. The Church indeed had all round
agreed to overlook Leo Taxil's early enormities; she forgot that she had
attempted to prosecute him and to fine him a round sum of 60,000 francs;
the supreme pontiff forgave him the accusation of poisoning, and
transmitted his apostolical benediction; he was complimented by the
cardinal-vicar of Rome; and he is in the proud position of a man who has
received felicitations and high approval from eighteen ecclesiastical
dignitaries, whether cardinals, archbishops, or bishops. With his back
against the *turris* 

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

*fortitudinis*, he faced his accusers stoutly and returned them blow for
blow. Nor did he lack his lay defenders, one of whom, by the mode which
he adopted, became himself, somewhat unexpectedly, a witness of Lucifer.

To those who disbelieve in the existence of Female Freemasonry, Leo
Taxil had offered two pieces of wise advice: Go to the Bibliothéque
Nationale, search the files of the Masonic organ *La Chaine d’Union*,
and you will find proof positive of your mistake. Next proceed to the
Maison T------, there is no need to reproduce the address, but it is
given by Leo Taxil in full, and obtain their current price-list of lodge
furniture, insignia, and other accessories, and you will find
particulars of aprons for sisters, diplomas for sisters, garters for
sisters, jewels for sisters. Except upon the signs of initiation, the
catalogue is not surrendered, but in view of the literature of
revelation the signs are no longer secret, &c.

All this is clearly outside the subject of Satanism, but it leads up,
notwithstanding, to the discovery of M. Ricoux. As to this gentleman

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

himself there are no particulars forthcoming; he has promised an account
of his adventures during four years as an emigrant in Chili; and he has
promised a patriotic epic in twelve cantos, but so far as my information
goes they remain in the womb of time. But he has a claim on our
consideration because it occurred to him that he would put in practice
the advice of Leo Taxil, which he did accordingly in. the autumn of
1891, and demonstrated to his own satisfaction that "Are there Women in
Freemasonry?" is a book of true disclosure, and a question that must be
answered in the affirmative. He performed thereupon a very creditable
action; he wrote a pamphlet entitled "The Existence of Lodges for Women:
Researches on this subject," &c., in which he stated the result of his
investigation, collected the controversy on the subject which had been
scattered through the press of the period, and defended Leo Taxil with
the warmth of an *alter Ego*. But he had not limited his researches to
the directions indicated in his author. Encouraged by the success which
had attended his initial efforts,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

he determined upon an independent experiment in bribery, and after the
same manner that Leo Taxil procured the "Ritual of the New and Reformed
Palladium," so he succeeded in obtaining the "Collection of Secret
Instructions to Supreme Councils, Grand Lodges, and Grand Orients,"
printed at Charleston in the year 1891. "This collection," he tells us,
"is certainly a document of the first order; for it emanates from
General Albert Pike, that is to say, from the 'Pope of the Freemasons.'"
On this document he bases the following statements:—(*a*) Universal
Freemasonry possesses a Supreme Directory as the apex of its
international organisation, and it is located at Berlin. (*b*) Four
subsidiary Central Directories exist at Naples, Calcutta, Washington,
and Monte Video. (*c*) Furthermore, a Chief of Political Action resides
at Rome, commissioned to watch over the Vatican and to precipitate
events against the Papacy. (*d*) A Grand Depositary of Sacred
Traditions, under the title of Sovereign Pontiff of Universal
Freemasonry, is located at Charleston, and at the time of the discovery
was Albert Pike,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

Some of these statements, it will be observed, require rectification, in
the light of fuller disclosures made by Palladian initiates, from whom
the material of my second chapter has been chiefly derived, but it will
be seen that it is substantially correct. M. Ricoux further states that
"Albert Pike reformed the ancient Palladian Rite, and imparted thereto
the Luciferian character in all its brutality. Palladism, for him, is a
selection; he surrenders to the ordinary lodges the adepts who confine
themselves to materialism, or invoke the Grand Architect without daring
to apply to him his true name, and under the title of Knights Templars
and Mistress Templars, he groups the fanatics who do not shrink from the
direct patronage of Lucifer."

The most serious mistake which has been made in the use of' the material
is an unconscious attempt to read into the "encyclicals" of Albert Pike
a proportion of Leo Taxil's material, for which the long citations given
by M. Ricoux do not afford a warrant. What he really appears to have
obtained is the instructions of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pike as Supreme
Commander Grand Master of the Supreme Council of the Mother-Lodge of the
Ancient and Accepted Scotch Rite of Charleston to the Twenty-three
Supreme Confederated Councils of the Globe. And the Scotch Rite is, by
the hypothesis, apart from the Palladium. In other respects, the
information comes to much the same thing. The long document which the
pamphlet prints *in extenso* exhibits Albert Pike preaching Palladism in
the full foulness of its doctrine and practice—the "resolution of the
problem of the flesh" by indiscriminate satisfaction of the passions;
the multiplication of androgyne lodges for this purpose; the dual nature
of the Divine Principle; and the cultus of Lucifer as the good God. The
most curious feature of the performance is that here again it is from
end to end a travesty of Éliphas Lévi, slice after slice from his chief
writings, combined with interlineal additions, which give them a sense
diametrically opposed to that of the great magus. Now, it is impossible
that two persons, working independently for the production of bogus
documents,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

should both borrow from the same source; hence Leo Taxil and M. Ricoux,
if they have been guilty of imposition, must certainly have
collaborated. It is unreasonable, however, to advance such an accusation
in the absence of any evidence, and if we accept the contribution of M.
Ricoux as made in perfect good faith, we must acknowledge that it
exonerates Leo Taxil from the possible suspicion of himself adapting
Lévi; and then the existence of a theurgic society, based on Manichæan
principles, instituted by Albert Pike, and possessing a magical ritual
taken in part from Lévi, wears a more serious aspect than when it rested
on the unsupported assurance of one witness. The discovery of M. Ricoux
is obviously of the first importance, and it is certainly to be
regretted that he has not substantiated it by depositing the "Collection
of Instructions" in the National Library, supposing it to be in his
possession, or by photographing instead of transcribing, supposing he
was pledged to its return.
