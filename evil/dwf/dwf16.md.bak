### CHAPTER XIV

#### THE RADIX OF MODERN DIABOLISM

WE have finished with the witnesses of Lucifer, and I think that the
search-light of a drastic criticism has left them in considerable
disarray. We approach the limit of the present inquiry, but before
summing up and presenting such a general statement or conclusion as may
be warranted by the facts, there is one point, left over hereunto, and
designed for final consideration, because it appeals more exclusively to
professed transcendentalists, which it will be necessary to treat
briefly. I have already indicated that sporadic revivals of black magic
have occasionally been heard of by mystics here in England, and from
time to time we have also heard vaguely of obscure assemblies of
Luciferians. Quite recently an interview with

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Papus, the French
occultist, published in *Light*, mentions a society which was devoted to
the cultus of Lucifer, star of the morning, quite distinct from Masonry,
quite unimportant, and since very naturally dead. Now, a large
proportion of mystics here in England are High-Grade Masons, and if a
society of the Palladium had extended to anything remotely approaching
the proportions alleged, they could not have failed to know of it. I
will go further and affirm that our non-Masonic transcendental
associations have abundant opportunities to become acquainted with
institutions similar to their own, and it is preposterous to suppose
that there could be several Palladian triangles working their degrees in
this country without our being aware of the fact. But we have not been
aware of it, and our only informations concerning Palladism have come to
us from France. We do not accept these informations; we know that the
persons here in England who are alleged by French false witnesses to be
connected with the Palladium are not so connected, and are now learning
of it for the first time. The statements

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

concerning Mr John Yarker are categorically untrue; the gross calumny
published by the "converted" Diana Vaughan about Dr Wynn Westcott, who
happens to be a High-Grade Mason, she will never dare to come forth from
her "retreat" and re-affirm within the jurisdiction of these islands,
because she knows well that a British jury would make a large demand
upon her reputed American dollars. Let us, however, put aside for the
moment the mendacities and forgeries which complicate the question of
Lucifer, and let us approach Palladism from an altogether different
side. I believe that I may speak with a certain accent of authority upon
any question which connects with the French magus Éliphas Lévi. I am an
old student of his works, and of the aspects of occult science and
magical history which arise out of them; in the year 1886 I published a
digest of his writings which has been the only attempt to present them
to English readers until the present year when I have undertaken a
translation in extenso of the *Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie*, which
is actually in the hands of the printer. Now,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

it has not been alleged in so many words that the. radix of Modern
Diabolism and the Masonic cultus of Lucifer is to be found in Éliphas
Lévi, but that is the substance of the charge. Most, or all, of the
witnesses agree in representing him as an atrocious Satanist, an invoker
of Lucifer, a celebrater of black masses, and an adept in the practical
blasphemies of Eucharistic sacrilege; all of them father either upon the
Palladium or upon Pike a variety of documents containing gross thefts
from Lévi; some of them, directly and upon their own responsibility,
cite passages from his works, always with conspicuous bad faith.
Finally, they agree in connecting him with the foundation of the New and
Reformed Palladium through his alleged disciple Phileas Waller; and one
of them goes so far as to say that Palladism was a further development
or restoration of a Satanic society directed by Éliphas Lévi and
operating his theurgic system, which he in turn, if I rightly understand
the mixed hypothesis of M. de la Rive, may have derived from the
Palladic rite of 1730. If we accept for the

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

moment this origin of the reformed order, it will follow that if the
occult doctrines of Éliphas Lévi have been seriously misunderstood or
grossly defamed by the witnesses, the diabolical or Luciferian
connection of Palladism does not wear the complexion which has been
ascribed to it. It is represented as: (*a*) outwardly Masonic, and (*b*)
actually theurgic. (*c*) It is Manichæan in doctrine. (*d*) It regards
Lucifer as an eternal principle co-existent, but in a hostile sense,
with Adonaï. (*e*) It holds that the beneficent deity is Lucifer, while
Adonaï is malevolent; (*f*) Certain sections of Palladists, however,
recognise that Lucifer is identical with Satan, and is the evil
principle. (*g*) This section adores the evil principle as such. Now, in
each and all these matters the Palladian system conflicts with that of
Lévi.

To give a colourable aspect to their hypothesis, the witnesses affirm
that Lévi was a high-grade Mason. He was nothing of the kind; he affirms
most distinctly in his "History of Magic," that for any knowledge which
he possessed about the mysteries of the fraternity,

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

he owed his initiation only to God and to his individual studies.
Secondly, the practice of ceremonial magic, which is what the witnesses
understand by theurgy, is a practice condemned by Lévi, except as an
isolated experiment to fortify intellectual conviction as to the truth
of magical theorems. He attempted it for this purpose in the spring of
the year 1854, and having satisfied himself as to the fact, he did not
renew it. Thirdly, the philosophy of Éliphas Lévi is in direct contrast
to Manichæan doctrine; it cannot be explained by dualism, but must be
explained by its opposite, namely, triplicity in unity. He shows that
"the unintelligent disciples of Zoroaster have divided the duad without
referring it to unity, thus separating the pillars of the temple, and
seeking to halve God" (*Dogme*, p. 129, 2nd edition). Is that a
Manichæan doctrine? Again: " If you conceive the Absolute as two, you
must immediately conceive it as three to recover the unity principle"
(*Ibid*.). Once more: "Divinity, one in its essence, has two fundamental
conditions of being—necessity and liberty " (*Ibid*., p. 127).

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And yet again: "If
God were one only, He would never be Creator nor Father. If He were two,
there would be antagonism or division in the infinite, and this would be
severance or death for every possible existence; He is therefore three
for the creation by Himself, and in His image of the infinite multitude
of beings and numbers. Thus He is really one in Himself and triple in
our conception, by which we also behold Him triple in Himself and one in
our intelligence and in our love. This is a mystery for the faithful and
a logical necessity for the initiate of the absolute and true sciences"
(*Ibid*., p. 138). And the witnesses of Lucifer have the effrontery to
represent Lévi as a dualist! I will not discredit their understanding by
supposing that they could misread so plain a principle, nor dissemble my
full conviction that they acted with intentional bad faith. Fourthly,
Éliphas Lévi regarded Lucifer as a conception of transcendental
mythology, and the devil as an impossible fiction, or an inverted and
blasphemous conception of God—divinity *à rebours*.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He describes the
Ophite heresy which offered adoration to the serpent and the Caïnite
heresy which justified the revolt of the first angel and the first
murderer as errors fit for classification with the monstrous idols of
the anarchic symbolism of India (*Rituel*, pp. 13, 14). Is that
diabolism? Is that the cultus of Lucifer? True, Lévi did not believe in
the personal existence of a father of lies, and if it be Satanism not to
do so, let us be content to diabolise with Lévi while the false
witnesses illustrate the methods of their father.

It is unnecessary to multiply quotations, but here is one more: "The
author of this book is a Christian like you; his faith is that of a
Catholic deeply and strongly convinced; therefore his mission is not to
deny dogmas, but to combat impiety under one of its most dangerous
forms, that of erroneous belief and superstition. . . . Away with the
idol which hides our Saviour I Down with the tyrant of falsehood! Down
with the black god of the Manichæans! Down with the Ahriman of the old
idolaters! Live God alone and His incarnate

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Logos, Jesus the
Christ, Saviour of the world, who beheld Satan precipitated from
heaven!" Go to, M. le Docteur Bataille! *À bas*, Signor Margiotta! Phi,
diabolus and Leo Taxil!

Seeing then that Éliphas Lévi has been calumniously represented, and
that he was not a Satanist, he could not have founded a Satanic society,
nor could a Manichæan order have been developed out of his doctrines.
Hence if a Palladian Society do exist at Charleston, it either owes
nothing to Lévi, or its cultus has been falsely described. In other
words, from whatever point we approach the witnesses of Lucifer, they
are subjected to a rough unveiling. In the words of the motto on my
title, the first in this plot was Lucifer—*videlicet*, the Father of
Lies!
