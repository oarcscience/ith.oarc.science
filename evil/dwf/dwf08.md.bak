### CHAPTER VI

#### ART SACERDOTAL

SOME few months after the first testimonies to Palladism appeared, under
the signatures of the witnesses whom we have already examined, a fresh
contribution was made to the literature of Diabolism in its connection
with Masonry, by a work entitled "Freemasonry, the Synagogue of Satan."
The exalted ecclesiastical position of the author, Mgr. Léon Meurin,
S.J., Archbishop of Port Louis in Mauritius, gave new impetus and an
aspect of increased importance to accusations preferred at the
beginning, as we have seen, by comparatively obscure or directly
suspected writers. The performance, moreover, was apparently so learned,
in some respects so unlooked for, and withal so methodical, that it
became subsequently a source of universal reference in anti-Masonic
literature.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

To this day M. Huysman remains dazzled, and to those in search of
reliable information on the subject, he says:—"If you would be saved
from the excesses of unseated reason, and from narratives of Dunciad
dulness, try Mgr. Meurin; read the Archbishop on Palladism." Within
certain limits the advice is well-grounded; the art sacerdotal in its
application to Anti-Masonry may leave much to be desired, but as a
specimen of the superior criticism obtaining upon this subject in higher
circles, it offers a strong contrast to the general tone and touch among
the rank and file of the accusers. We are, in fact, warranted upon every
consideration, in expecting a valuable contribution to our knowledge;
but, I may say at once, that this expectation is unfortunately not
realised. With a keen philosophical anticipation one turns the pages of
"Freemasonry, the Synagogue of Satan," admires their beautiful
typography, lingers with delight over the elaborate appendix of
allegorical engravings, and experiences a brief sense of intellectual
inferiority in the presence of such formidable sections, and so

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

portentous a table of contents. It should be impossible to speak of the
Archbishop without a mental genuflexion, but it remains true that our
expectation is not realised. It will become us, at the same time, to
speak as tenderly as possible of a pious and learned prelate who has now
passed where Masons cease from Satanising and the thirty-three degrees
are at rest. But it must be said plainly that the contents of his very
large volume offer little to our purpose.

By the nature of his episcopal charge Mgr. Meurin had special facilities
for ascertaining how men diabolise; the island of Mauritius has enjoyed
many privileges of Infernus. There we lose sight of the Rosicrucians on
the road to India; there the Comte de Chazal initiated Dr Bacstrom, and
all this, of course, is diabolical from the standpoint of Anti-Masonry.
Moreover, it must not be forgotten that Mgr. Meurin, in a series of
wonderful conferences, has exhibited the superstitions of Mauritius,
and, accepting the test of M. Huysman, the existence of Black Magic in
this French colony is proved to hilt and handle by wholesale Eucharistic

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

depreciations, the sacrifice of cats at midnight upon the altars of
rifled churches, and the discovery of the blood of the victims in the
chalices used for the elements. The Church does not stir in the matter;
it deplores and prays, which seems, in some respects, an ineffectual
method of protecting the *latens Deitas*. If the Eucharist be liable to
profanation, why reserve the Eucharist? Surely the negligence which
makes such profanations possible is the offer of opportunity to Deicide,
and great carelessness is cousin to condonation. However this may be,
Mgr. Meurin seems to have been quite the authority to whom one would
naturally refer for specific information upon devil-worship as it
obtains within his own diocese, even if apart from Masonry. But he is
too erudite to concern himself with individual facts, and he so far
transcends diocesan limitations as to forget Mauritius completely.
Another witness, who perhaps never visited Port Louis, affirms that the
Central Directory of the Palladium for Africa is established in that
place, but the prelate of Port Louis, from whom the information

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

would have been precious, seems acquainted with nothing of the kind. The
weapon of the mitred warrior is, at the same time, a sufficiently
portentous thesis, as follows:—that Freemasonry is connected with
Satanism, by the fact that it has the Jews for its true authors, and the
Jewish Kabbalah for the key of its mysteries; that the Kabbalah is
magical, idolatrous, and essentially diabolical; that Freemasonry,
considered as a religion, is therefore a judaized devil-worship, and
considered as a political institution, it is an engine designed for the
attainment of universal empire, which has been the dream of the Jews for
centuries.

My readers will be inclined to consider that such a hypothesis, though
it may square with the Satanism of Adriano Lemmi, who, as we shall see,
is accused of circumcision, can hardly be brought into harmony with the
universal Masonry of Albert Pike, as the latter was neither Jew nor
Judaiser. But common hatred of the Catholic Church is, in the opinion of
Mgr. Meurin, a sufficient bond to identify the interests of both
parties. Let us start, therefore,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

with the archbishop's own hypothesis, which he compresses into a single
sentence: "To encircle the brow of the Jew with the royal diadem, and to
place the kingdom of the world at his feet—such is the true end of
Freemasonry." And again: "The Jewish Kabbalah is the philosophical basis
and Key of Freemasonry." Once more: "The end of Freemasonry is universal
dominion, and Freemasonry is a Jewish institution."

Accepting these statements as points that admit of being argued with
deference to the rules of right reason, let us establish in turn two
positions which do not admit of being argued because they are evident in
themselves: (*a*) Where the significance of symbols is uncertain, it is
easy to interpret falsely; (*b*) When a subject is obscure and
difficult, no person is qualified to speak positively if his knowledge
be obtained at second-hand. Now, have we good reason to suppose that
Mgr. Meurin is possessed of first-hand knowledge, and is consequently in
a position to interpret truly upon the difficult subject he has
undertaken, namely, the esoteric

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

doctrines of the Kabbalah? If not, we are entitled to dismiss him
without further examination. As a fact, in this preliminary and
essential matter the archbishop can stand no test, The antiquity of the
Kabbalah is necessary to work his hypothesis, and he assumes it as if
unaware that its antiquity had ever been impugned. There may be much to
be said upon both sides of this hotly-debated question, but there is
nothing to be said for a writer who seems ignorant that there is a
question. And hence my readers will in no way be astonished to learn
that his information is obtained at second-hand, or that his one
authority is Franck. This fact is the key to his entire work, and the
sole credit that is due to him is the skilful appearance of erudition
which he has given to a shallow performance, and the natural mental
elegance which has prevented him from being noisy and violent.

Our inquiry into modern devil-worship does not warrant us in discussing
the position of writers who choose to assume that the Kabbalah,
Gnosticism, and other systems are *à* 

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

*priori* diabolical, because assumptions of this kind are unreasonable.
There are writers at this moment in France who argue that the English
word God is the equivalent of Lucifer, but one does not dispute with
these. For the satisfaction of my readers, it may, however, be as well
to state that the voluminous treatise of Mgr. Meurin has come into
existence because he has discovered, as one might say, accidentally,
that the number 33, which is that of the degrees in French Freemasonry,
is the number of the divinities in the Vedas, thus creating a
presumption that the mysteries of Freemasonry connect with those of
antiquity. Of course they connect with antiquity, for the simple reason
that there is a solidarity between all symbolisms, and, moreover, it is
perfectly clear that Masonry has either inherited from the past by a
perpetuated tradition, or has borrowed therefrom, Mgr. Meurin had
therefore as little reason to be astonished at the correctness of his
presumption when he came to work it out as he had to be delighted with
the inference which prevails throughout his inquiry, namely, that

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the mysteries of pagan antiquity were delusions of the devil, and that
modern mysteries which connect with those are also diabolical delusions.
Indeed he is so continually making discoveries which are fresh to
himself, and to no one acquainted with the subject, that one would be
pleasantly diverted by his simplicity if it were not for the bad faith
which underlies his assumptions. For example, every one who knows
anything of Goëtic literature is aware that the rituals of black magic
incorporate heterogeneous elements from Kabbalistic sources, but to Mgr.
Meurin this fact comes with the force of a surprise.

His Masonic erudition is about as great and as little as his proficiency
in Kabbalah; he quotes Carlyle as "an authority," applies the term
orthodox to French Freemasonry exclusively, whereas the developments of
the Fraternity in France have always had a heterodox complexion, while
his tripartite classification of the 33 degrees of that rite and of the
Ancient Accepted Scotch Rite is made in an arbitrary manner to suit a
preconceived theory, and

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

entirely effaces the importance inherent in the first three grades,
which are themselves the sum of Masonry. Moreover, the classification in
question is presented as a most secret instruction imparted in some
fastness of Masonry outside the 33 degrees, but no authority is named.

Such being the qualifications and such the methods of the archbishop, I
do not propose to accompany him through the long course of his
interpretations, but will supply instead, for the economy of labour on
the part of those who may wish to follow in his footsteps, a skeleton
plan of procedure by which they will be able to prove learnedly anything
they please in Freemasonry.

It is well known that the Fraternity makes use of mystic numbers and
other symbols. Take, therefore, any mystic number, or combination of
numbers, as *e.g.*, 3 × 3=9. You will probably be unacquainted with the
meaning which attaches to the figure of the product, but it will occur
to you that the 9 of spades is regarded as the disappointment in
cartomancy. Begin, therefore, by confidently expecting something

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

bad. Reflect upon the fact that cards have been occasionally denominated
the Devil's Books. Conclude thence that Freemasonry is the Devil's
Institution. Do not be misled by the objection that there is no
traceable connection between cards and Masonry; anticipate an occult
connection or secret *liaison*. The term last used has probably occurred
to you by the will of God; do not forget that it describes a
questionable sexual relationship. Be sure, therefore, that Freemasonry
is a veil of the worst species of moral licence. You have now reached an
important stage in the unmasking of Masonry, and you can sum it as
follows:—Freemasonry is the cultus of the Phallus. If you know anything
of ecclesiastical Latin, the words *noctium phantasmata* may perhaps
occur to you, and the whole field of demonology in connection with the
Fraternity will open before you. But if you would confine yourself to
the region of lubricity, recollect that our first parents went naked
till the serpent tempted them, and then they wore aprons. Hence the
apron, which is a masonic emblem, has from time immemorial

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

been the covering of shame. Should it occur to you—vide *Genesis*—that
God made the aprons, dismiss it as a temptation of the devil, who would,
if possible, prevent you from unveiling him. By this time it will be
well to recur to the number 9; your chain of reasoning has established
that it possesses a horrible significance. Now take the number and
follow it through the history of religions by means of some theological
ready-reckoner, such as a cheap dictionary by Migne. You will be sure to
find something to your purpose—i.e., something sufficiently bad. Place
that significance against the use of that number in Masonry. Repeat this
process, picking up anything serviceable by the way, and continue so
doing till your volume has attained its required dimensions. You will
never want for materials, and this is how Masonry is unveiled.

There is no exaggeration in this sketch; Mgr. Meurin is indeed by far
more fatuous. On the 26th of May 1876 the Supreme Council of Sovereign
Grand Inspectors General of the 33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted
Scotch Rite

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

are said to have issued a circular, dated from 33 Golden Square, London.
Will my readers believe their own eyes or my sincerity when I say that
the most illustrious of the French Anti-Masonic interpreters, member of
the Society of Jesus, and Archbishop of Port Louis, solemnly enjoins us
to "remark the No. 33 and the square of gold, which signify the supreme
place in the world assigned to the liberty of gold"? By thus commenting
on a significant number attaching to a real address, situated, as
everyone knows, in the most central district of this city, Archbishop
Meurin believes that he is not descending from pleasant comedy into
screaming farce of interpretation, but that he is acting seriously and
judiciously, has a right to look wise, and to believe that he has hit
hard!

No person who is acquainted with the Kabbalah, even in its historical
aspects, much less the ripe scholar, M. A. Franck, from whom the
materials are derived, will tolerate for a moment the theory that this
mystical literature of the Jewish nation is capable of a diabolical
interpretation.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In particular it
lends itself to the crude Manichæan system attributed to Albert Pike
about as much and as little as it does to atheistic materialism. The
reading of Mgr. Meurin may be compared with that of Mirandola, who
discovered, not dualism, but the Christian mystery of the Trinity
contained indubitably therein, who regarded it with more reason as the
bridge by which the Jew might ultimately pass over to Christ, who
infected a pontiff with his enthusiasm, and it will be seen that the
Catholic Archbishop looks ridiculous in the lustre of his derived
erudition. To insist further on this point is, however, scarcely to our
purpose. The Kabbalah does not possess that integral connection with
Masonry which is argued by Mgr. Meurin, and if it did, does not bear the
interpretation which he assigns it, while his anti-Semitic thesis is
demolished with the other hypothesis. But these things are largely
outside the question which concerns us most directly. Over and above
these points, does the witness whom we are examining contribute anything
to our knowledge on the subject

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

of the New and Reformed Palladium, otherwise Universal Masonry? The
reply is perfectly clear. His one source of knowledge is Adolphe Ricoux;
by some oversight he has not even the advantage of the rituals published
by Leo Taxil. He may, therefore, be dismissed out of hand. The Satanism
which he exhibits in Masonry is an imputed Satanism, and as to any
actual Devil-Worship he reproduces as true the clever story of *Aut
Diabolus, aut Nihil*, which appeared originally in "Blackwood's
Magazine," and has since been reprinted by its author, who states, what
most people know already, that it is entirely fictitious.

In parting with the writer of "Freemasonry, the Synagogue of Satan," as
with a witness whose evidence has broken down, it must be repeated that
he has, by his exalted position, elegance of method, and show of
learning, been a chief pillar of the Satanic hypothesis.
