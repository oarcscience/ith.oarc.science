PART II

THE declaration of the Evil Spirit could not to make a great commotion,
and to have results which required precautions to be taken at once. The
Canon, like a wise man, put himself in communication with Justice, and
informed the magistrates of what was passing at the convent, on the 11th
October, 1632. Grandier, prepared for all contingencies, had already
taken his measures. Many of the magistrates belonged to the new religion
and were favourable to him, looking upon him as a secret adherent; they
served him as he expected. At the same time, he made all possible use of
his extraordinary talents for pettifogging, presented petition on
petition, questioned every statement of the exorcists and of the nuns,
threatened their confessor

<span id="page_v2_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mignon, complained
that his reputation was attacked, and that the means were thus taken
from him of doing the good his position required, and demanded that the
nuns should be locked up and the exorcisms be put an end to. He knew
well enough that his demands were out of the question, and that civil
justice has nothing to do with the exercise of religious functions. But
he wished, if possible, to embarrass the exorcists, and commit the
judges with the bishops, or, at any rate, throw discord among them, and
give his Calvinists an opportunity of crying out; he succeeded.

The magistrates separated. Only those who were favourable to him
remained: the rest ceased to appear at the exorcisms, and Mignon soon
withdrew from the convent. Excitement rose in the public mind, a
thousand arguments on this or that side permeated the town, and a
thousand quarrels took place on all sides.

This excitement, however, and these disputes settled nothing, and the
exorcisms, which continued, had no better result. Grandier triumphed,
and his friends admired his wit, his skill, and proclaimed aloud that he
could be convicted of nothing, not even as regards women, although they
knew well how far he had gone in this matter. Until now, the Court had
taken no notice of the affair; but the noise it had made in

<span id="page_v2_7">p. 7</span>

the world since the first days of October 1632 had reached the Queen's
ears. She requested information, and the Abbé Marescot, one of her
chaplains, was sent to examine into the matter and report to her. He
arrived at Loudun on the 28th November, and witnessed what was going on.
No immediate consequences followed: but an incident soon occurred, which
caused a sudden change in the position of affairs.

The King had resolved to raze the castles and fortresses existing in the
heart of the kingdom, and commissioned M. de Laubardemont to see to the
demolition of that of Loudun. He arrived, and saw what a ferment the
town was in, the animosity that reigned there, and the kind of man who
caused the commotion. The complaints of those who were victims of the
debaucheries, of the pride, or of the vengeance of the curate, touched
him, and it seemed to him important to put an end to the scandal. On his
return he informed the King and the Cardinal-Minister of the facts:
Louis XIII., naturally pious and just, perceived the greatness of the
evil, and deemed it his duty to put a stop to it. He appointed M. de
Laubardemont to investigate the matter without appeal; with orders to
choose in the neighbouring jurisdictions the most straightforward and
learned judges. The Commission is dated 30th November, 1633.

<span id="page_v2_8">p. 8</span>

Nothing less was needed to bring to justice a man upheld by a seditious
and enterprising party, and so well versed in the details of
*chicannerie:* an art always shameful in any man, but especially to an
ecclesiastic. The King issued at the same time two decrees, to arrest
and imprison Grandier and his accomplices. Armed with such powers, the
Commissioner did not fear to attack a man who had so often succeeded in
gaining either a nonsuit on some question of form, or in turning
accusations to his own advantage, or else dragging out proceedings to
such a length as to weary his adversaries and his judges.

The Calvinists, already irritated at the razing of the Castle which
served them as a rallying place in times of rebellion, cried out against
this new tribunal, because they saw that it was the sole means of
rendering useless the knaveries of their friend. But they cried out much
louder when the Commissioner arrested the accused, without waiting for
informations, and seized all his papers. As if it were not well known
that, in criminal matters, this mode of proceeding is usual. In this
case it was absolutely necessary. For, without this precaution, Grandier
might have fled, and defended himself from afar, engaging the attention
of judges, who had plenty of work elsewhere. He might even have raised
tumults in the city, which might have necessitated violent remedies.

<span id="page_v2_9">p. 9</span>

These precautions being taken, the Commissioner commenced his
investigation, and proceeded to hear witnesses on the 17th December,
7633.

The Commissioner now learned of what Grandier and his party were
capable. The witnesses were so intimidated that none would speak, and it
required all the Royal Authority to reassure them. He therefore issued a
proclamation forbidding the intimidation of witnesses, under penalty of
prosecution; and the Bishop of Poitiers having supported the King's
decision, the two priests, Gervais Méchin and Martin Boulieau, who had
been forced to retract their evidence in the former trial, presented a
petition in which they declared that they had been seduced and
constrained by several persons in authority to recall their evidence,
and they now affirmed their first evidence to be true. The evidence of
the nuns was also heard, and that of lay persons of both sexes, amongst
others of two women, the one of whom confessed having had criminal
relations with Grandier, and that he had offered to make her Princess of
Magicians, whilst the second confirmed the evidence of the first. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)

<span id="page_v2_10">p. 10</span>

As regards the nuns, they deposed that Grandier had introduced himself
into the convent by day <span id="page_v2_11">p. 11</span> and night for
four months, without anyone knowing how he got in; that he presented
himself to <span id="page_v2_12">p. 12</span> them whilst standing at
divine service and tempted them to indecent actions both by word and
deed; <span id="page_v2_13">p. 13</span> that they were often struck by
invisible persons; and that the marks of the blows were so visible <span
id="page_v2_14">p. 14</span> that the doctors and surgeons had easily
found them, and that the beginning of all these troubles <span
id="page_v2_15">p. 15</span> was signalized by the apparition of Prior
Moussaut, their first confessor. The Mother Superior and <span
id="page_v2_16">p. 16</span> seven or eight other nuns, when confronted
with Grandier, identified him, although it was ascertained <span
id="page_v2_17">p. 17</span> that they had never seen him save by magic,
and that he had never had anything to do <span id="page_v2_18">p.
18</span> with their affairs. The two women formerly mentioned and the
two priests maintained the <span id="page_v2_19">p. 19</span> truth of
their evidence. In a word, besides the nuns and six lay women, "sixty
witnesses deposed <span id="page_v2_20">p. 20</span> to adulteries,
incests, sacrileges, and other crimes, committed by the accused, even in
the most secret <span id="page_v2_21">p. 21</span> places of his church,
as in the vestry, where the Holy Host was kept, on all days and at all
hours."

<span id="page_v2_22">p. 22</span>

It may well be imagined that the mother, brothers and friends of the
accused did not <span id="page_v2_23">p. 23</span> abandon him. They
appealed to every possible authority. The details of these proceedings
would be as wearisome as useless, as the Commissioner, by the very terms
of his Commission, was placed above all such dilatory pettifogging, and
therefore refused or annulled all applications in that direction. He
then questioned the accused as to the facts and articles of accusation,
and after, having made hint sign his confessions and denials, proceeded
to Paris to inform the Court of what he had done.

The King and his Council thought it right to furnish him with means to
overcome all obstacles to a speedy decision. This precaution was
necessary, for letters from the Bailly of Loudun, Grandier's chief
supporter, to the Procurator-General of the Parliament, were
intercepted, in which it was asserted that the "possession" was an
imposter. The latter's reply was also seized. Monsieur de Laubardemont
returned therefore to Loudun with a Decree of the Council, dated 31st

<span id="page_v2_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> May 1634,
confirming all his powers and *prohibiting Parliament and all other
judges from interfering in this business, and forbidding all parties
concerned from appealing, under penalty of a fine of five hundred
livres*. He caused Grandier to be transferred from the prison of Augers
to that of [Loudun](errata.htm#6.md), so as to have him at hand to confront
with witnesses, if need be.

But, first of all, he considered it necessary to examine the nuns
carefully; for this purpose, with the consent of the Bishop, he
sequestrated them in different convents, and interrogated them so
severely that one might have thought that they themselves were the
magicians. "He saw them all, the one after the other, for several days;
and listened to their conversations, to observe their mode of thought.
He enquired minutely into their lives, their morals, their behavior, not
only secular but religious. His depositions, or notes, which represented
the evidence of twenty girls, including a few not nuns, filled fifty
rolls of official paper, and were the admiration of all judges, so great
was the prudence and care they demonstrated."

On the other hand the Bishop of Poitiers, after having sent several
Doctors of Theology to examine the victims, came to Loudun in person,
and exorcised them himself, or had them exorcised by others in his
presence for two months and a

<span id="page_v2_25">p. 25</span>

half. Never was work done with such care and attention.

All precognitions over, the Commissioner began to confront the accused
with the witnesses, and the latter maintained, face to face with
Grandier, the evidence they had given against him.

As regard the nuns, it was observed that they never contradicted
themselves, whether questioned together or separately, though they were
examined often, by different persons, and as skilfully as possible. Now,
criminals do not manage this, for the cleverest have the greatest
difficulty in avoiding contradictory statements. Those writers, who have
supported Grandier, have never discovered the least discrepancy in the
evidence of the nuns. Nor did Grandier ever plead malice on their part
as a defence, for they had never seen him, nor had he had anything to do
with their affairs, as we have said.

If, as calumny asserts, the only thing sought was the death of Grandier,
here were sufficient proofs to burn him, if only for abusing the
privileges of his ministry and of his Church, or for the sacrileges he
had committed therein. But justice is not satisfied with punishing one
kind of crime, when she finds traces of another still more serious. It
was moreover a Christian duty to assist the views of God, who permitted
so strange an event, to confound the calumnies of the protestants, and

<span id="page_v2_26">p. 26</span>

to prove the demonstration the "possession" of the nuns, and the magic
exercised by the accused. To this the Commissioners and the other judges
applied themselves.

Thus, as it was a matter rather of religion than of jurisprudence, they
resolved to begin by prayer to God, who is the Father of all Light,
rightly considering that all France was watching the trial with eager
eyes, that it was shrouded in a thick veil of obscurity, and that their
verdict would entail important consequences. They therefore prepared to
receive divine assistance and grace by frequent confessions, and by
often receiving the Holy Sacrament. Then they decreed a general
procession to implore celestial aid in so difficult a matter; and, to
excite the devotion of the masses by their example, they went in a body,
during the whole of the trial, to visit the Churches of the city, set
aside by the Bishop for forty hour services, and reached each in time
for the elevation of the host. Thence the Exorcists went to the Church
fixed upon for the Exorcisms, and the judges proceeded to the tribunal
to continue the case; in the evening all returned to church for
evensong.

The examination lasted forty days, during which Demons gave them the
clearest proofs of their presence in the bodies of the persons
exorcised, and every day added new evidence against Grandier, and yet
never said anything against him which

<span id="page_v2_27">p. 27</span>

did not turn out strictly true. These assertions merit distinct proof,
which will be found interesting.

As regards the presence of Devils in the possessed, the Church teaches
us in its ritual, that there are four principal signs, by which it can
be undoubtedly recognised. These signs are the speaking or understanding
of a language unknown to the person possessed; the revelation of the
future, or of events happening far away; the exhibition of strength
beyond the years and nature of the actor; and floating in the air for a
few moments.

The Church does not require, in order to have recourse to Exorcisms,
that all these marks should be found in the same subject; one alone, if
well authenticated, is sufficient to demand public exorcism.

Now, they are all to be found in the Nuns [of](errata.htm#7.md) Loudun, and
in such numbers that we can only. mention the principal cases.

Acquaintance with unknown tongues first showed itself in the
Mother-Superior. At the beginning, she answered in Latin the questions
of the Ritual proposed to her in that language. Later, she and the
others answered in any language they thought proper to question in.

M. de Launay de Razilli, who had lived in America, attested that, during
a visit to Loudun, he had spoken to them in the language of a certain

<span id="page_v2_28">p. 28</span>

savage tribe of that country, and that they had answered quite
correctly, and had revealed to him events that had taken place there.

Some gentlemen of Normandy certified in writing that they had questioned
Sister Clara de Sazilli in Turkish, Spanish, and Italian, and that her
answers were correct.

M. de Nismes, Doctor of the Sorbonne, and one of the chaplains of the
Cardinal de Lyon, having questioned them in Greek and German, was
satisfied with their replies in both languages.

Father Vignier, Superior of the Oratory at La Rochelle, bears witness in
his Latin Narrative, that, having questioned Sister Elizabeth a whole
afternoon in Greek, she always replied correctly and obeyed him in every
particular.

The Bishop of Nimes commanded Sister Clara in Greek to raise veil and to
kiss the railings at a certain spot; she obeyed, and did many other
things he ordered, which caused the prelate to exclaim that one must be
an Atheist or lunatic not to believe in "possession."

Some doctors questioned them also as to the meaning of some Greek
technical terms, extremely difficult to explain, and only known to the
most learned men, and they clearly expressed the real signification of
the words.

Lastly, Grandier himself being confronted with them, his Bishop invested
him with the stole to

<span id="page_v2_29">p. 29</span>

exorcise the Mother Superior, who, he declared, knew Latin; but he did
not dare to question her or the others in Greek, though they dared him
to it; whereon he remained very embarrassed. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md)

As to the Revelation of hidden matters or of events passing afar off,
proofs are still more abundant. We will only select a few of the most
remarkable.

M. Morin, Prior of St. Jacques de Thouars, having requested M. Morans,
Commissioner appointed by the Bishop of Poitiers to watch over the
possessed, and to assist in the trial of Grandier, to allow some sign to
be given proving *actual infernal possession*, whispered to M. de Morans
that he wished one of the possessed to bring him five rose leaves.
Sister Clara was then away in the refectory; M. de Morans ordered, in
his thoughts, the Demon who possessed her to obey the wish of M. Morin,
for the greater glory of God. Thereupon the Nun left the refectory, and
went into the garden, whence she brought first a pansy and other plants,
and presented them with roars of laughter, saying to M. de Morans:

<span id="page_v2_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Is that what you
wish, father? I am not a Devil, to guess your thoughts."—To which he
replied simply: "*Obedias*," obey. She then returned to the garden, and
after several repetitions of the order, presented through the railings a
little rose branch, on which were six leaves. The Exorcist said to her:
"*Obedias punctualiter sub pœnâ maledictionis*," obey to the letter
under penalty of malediction; she then plucked off one leaf, and offered
the branch saying: "I see you will only have five; the other was one too
many." The Prior was so convinced by what he saw, that he went out with
tears in his eyes. An official report of the fact was drawn up.

Madame de Laubardemont also tried the sane experiment, in order to
convince many sceptics who were present: and she was equally successful.

The *Liententant-Criminel* of Orleans, the President Tours,
Lieutenant-General de S. Maixant, and myself <span
id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) also had our curiosity gratified. I desired
that Sister Clara should bring me her beads, and say an *Ave-Maria*. She
first brought e. pin, and then some aniseed; being urged to obey, she
said: "I see you want something else,"

<span id="page_v2_31">p. 31</span>

and then she brought me her beads and offered to say an *Ave-Maria*.

M. Chiron, Prior of Maillezais, desiring to strengthen his belief in
demoniacal possession, begged M. de Morans to allow him to whisper to a
third party the sign he required; and he thereon whispered to M. de
Fernaison, Canon and Provost of the same Church, that he wished the nun
to fetch a missal then lying near the door, and to put her finger on the
introit of the mass of the Holy Virgin, beginning "Salve, Sancta
parens." M. de Morans, who had heard nothing, ordered Sister Clara, who
was likewise ignorant of what had been said, to obey the intentions of
M. Chiron. This young girl then fell into strange convulsions,
blaspheming, rolling on the ground, exposing her person in the most
indecent manner, without a blush, and with foul and lascivious
expressions and actions, <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) till she
caused all who looked on to hide their eyes with shame. Though she had
never seen the prior, she called him by his name, and said he should be
her lover. It was only

<span id="page_v2_32">p. 32</span>

after many repeated commands, and an hour's struggling, that she took up
the missal, saying: "I will pray." Then, turning her eyes in another
direction, she placed her finger on the capital S at the beginning of
the introit aforesaid, of which facts reports were drawn up.

M. de Milliere, a gentleman of Maine, certified that, being present at
the Exorcism of Sister Clara, and on his knees, the Devil asked him
whether he was saying a *De Profundis* for his wife, which was the case.
The Marquis de la Mothe, son of M. de Parabel, governor of Poitou,
certified that sister Louise de Nogeret had disclosed his most secret
faults in the presence of Father Tranquille, and of Madame de Neuillant,
his aunt.

The same M. de la Mothe also asked an Exorcist to make Sister Clara, who
was in the convent, come out, kneel down, and say an Ave Maria; she came
after repeated commands, and obeyed.

Chevalier de Mere, who was present, asked the Devil on what day he had
last confessed. The Devil answered Friday. The Chevalier acknowledged
this to be correct; whereupon Sister Clara withdrew. But as he wished to
try the Devil again, he begged the exorcist to make her return, and
whispered some words to the Marquis and the Monk, for the nun to repeat.
The exorcist refused, as the words were indecent. He changed

<span id="page_v2_33">p. 33</span>

them, therefore, into *Pater, et Filius et Spiritus Sanctus!* He
whispered these words so low, that the exorcist could hardly hear them.
The nun, who was in another room, came at the command of the Father, and
addressing the Chevalier, first said the indecent words the monk had
refused, and then repeated several times *Gloria patri et filio et
Spiritui Sancta*. She was ordered to say the words, exactly as she had
been desired, but she said she would not.

The Bishop of Nîmes, being present at an exorcism by Father Surin,
begged him to order something in difficult Latin; and the Demon
thereupon performed what was wanted.

A Jesuit wishing to try what so many people stated they had experienced,
gave an inward order to a demon who had been exorcised; and then
immediately another. In the space of a second he gave five or six
orders, which he countermanded one after another; and thus tormented the
Devil, who was ordered to obey his intentions. The Demon repeated his
commands aloud, beginning by the first, and adding, "But you wont," and
when he had come to the last he said, "Now let's see whether we can do
this."

"When it rained," says Father Surin, "the Devil used to place the Mother
Superior under the wafer spout. As I knew this to be a habit of his, I
commanded him mentally to bring her to me;

<span id="page_v2_34">p. 34</span>

whereupon she used to come and ask me: 'What do you want.'"

Another thing which struck the Exorcists, was the instantaneous answers
they gave to the most difficult questions of Theology, as to grace, the
vision of God, Angels, the Incarnation and similar subjects, always in
the very terns used in the schools.

The corporal effect of possession is a proof which strikes the coarsest
minds. It has this other advantage, that an example convinces a whole
[assembly](errata.htm#8). <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md)

<span id="page_v2_35">p. 35</span>

Now the nuns of Loudun gave these proofs daily. When the Exorcist gave
some order to <span id="page_v2_36">p. 36</span> the Devil, the nuns
suddenly passed from a state of quiet into the most terrible
convulsions, and <span id="page_v2_37">p. 37</span> without the
[slightest](errata.htm#13.md) increase of pulsation. They struck their
chests and backs with their heads, <span id="page_v2_38">p. 38</span> as
if they had had their neck broken, and with inconceivable rapidity; they
twisted their arms <span id="page_v2_39">p. 39</span> at the joints of
the shoulder, the elbow and the wrist two or three times round; lying on
their <span id="page_v2_40">p. 40</span> stomachs they joined their
palms of their hands to the soles of their feet; their faces became so
as the commissioners should incline. It further <span id="page_v2_41">p.
41</span> frightful one could not bear to look at them; their eyes
remained open without winking; their tongues <span id="page_v2_42">p.
42</span> issued suddenly from their mouths, horribly swollen, black,
hard, and covered with pimples, <span id="page_v2_43">p. 43</span> and
yet while in this state they spoke distinctly; they threw themselves
back till their heads touched <span id="page_v2_44">p. 44</span> their
feet, and walked in this position with wonderful rapidity, and for a
long time. They uttered: cries so horrible and so loud that nothing like
it was ever heard before; they made use of expressions so indecent as to
shame the most debauched of men, while their acts, both in exposing
themselves and inviting lewd behaviour from those present, would have
astonished the inmates of the lowest brothel in the country; they <span
id="page_v2_45">p. 45</span> uttered maledictions against the three
Divine Persons of the Trinity, oaths and blasphemous expressions so
execrable, so unheard of, that they could not have suggested themselves
to the human mind. They used to watch without rest, and fast five or six
days at a time, or be tortured twice a day as we have described during
several hours, without their health suffering; on the contrary, those
that were somewhat delicate, appeared healthier than before their
possession.

The Devil sometimes made them fall suddenly asleep: they fell to the
ground and became so heavy, that the strongest man had great trouble in
even moving their heads. Françoise Filestreau having her mouth closed,
one could hear within her body different voices speaking at the same
time, quarrelling, and discussing who should make her speak.

Lastly, one often saw Elizabeth Blanchard, in her convulsions, with her
feet in the air and her head on the ground, leaning against a chair or a
window sill without other support.

The Mother Superior from the beginning was carried off her feet and
remained suspended in the air at the height of 24 inches. A report of
this was drawn up and sent to the Sorbonne, signed by a great number of
witnesses, ecclesiastics and doctors, and the judgement thereon of the
Bishop of Poitiers who was also a witness. The doctors

<span id="page_v2_46">p. 46</span>

of the Sorbonne were of the same opinion as the Bishop, and declared
that infernal possession was proved.

Both she and other nuns lying flat, without moving foot, hand, or body,
were suddenly lifted to their feet like statues.

In another exorcism the Mother Superior was suspended in the air, only
touching the ground with her elbow.

Others, when comatose, became supple like a thin piece of lead, so that
their body could be bent in every direction, forward, backward, or
sideways, till their head touched the ground; and they remained thus so
long as their position was not altered by others.

At other times they passed the left foot over their shoulder to the
cheek. They passed also their feet over their head till the big toe
touched the tip of the nose.

Others again were able to stretch their legs so far to the right and
left that they sat on the ground without any space being visible between
their bodies and the floor, their bodies erect and their hands joined.

One, the Mother Superior, stretched her legs to such an extraordinary
extent, that from toe to toe the distance was 7 feet, though she was
herself but 4 feet high.

But sometime before the death of Grandier,

<span id="page_v2_47">p. 47</span>

this lady had a still stranger experience. In a few words this is what
happened: In an exorcism the Devil promised Father Lactance as a sign of
his exit, that he would make three wounds on the left side of the Mother
Superior. He described their appearance and stated the day and hour when
they would appear. He said he would come out from within, without
affecting the nun's health, and forbade that any remedy should be
applied, as the wounds would leave no mark.

On the day named, the exorcism took place; and as many doctors had come
from the neighbouring towns to be present at this event, M. de
Laubardemont made them draw near, and permitted then to examine the
clothes of the nun, to uncover her side in the presence of the assembly,
to look into all the folds of her dress, of her stays which were of
whalebone, and of her chemise, to make sure there was no weapon: she
only had about her her scissors, which were given over to another. M. de
Laubardemont asked the doctors to tie her; hut they begged him to let
them first see the convulsions they had heard spoken of. He granted
this, and during the convulsions the Superior suddenly came to herself
with a sigh, pressed her right hand to her left side and withdrew it
covered with blood. She was again examined, and the doctors with the
whole assembly saw three bloody wounds, of the size stated by the Devil;
the

<span id="page_v2_48">p. 48</span>

chemise, the stays, and the dress were pierced in three places, the
largest hole looking as if a pistol bullet had passed through. The nun
was thereupon entirely stripped, but no instrument of any description
was found upon her. A report was immediately drawn up, and *Monsieur*,
brother of the King, who witnessed the facts, with all the nobles of his
Court, attested the document.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[v2\_9:\*](dol03.htm#fr_6.md) Our forefathers, if
not more moral than ourselves, certainly punished immorality, *when
discovered*, much more severely, as is witnessed by the following
proclamation:—

"William by the Grace of God, King of Great <span id="page_10">p.

Macers of Our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sherifs in that
part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Forasmuch as, notwithstanding of the many good Laws and Acts of
Parliament made against Prophaneness, and for the restraining and
suppressing of Vice and Immoralities, the same do still abound, to the
great dishonour of God, the Reproach of the true Protestant Religion,
and to the hurt and prejudice of the Peace and Government of the Realm;
And We being resolved, as it hath alwise been Our Care, to have these
Laws and Acts of Parliament put in due and vigorous Execution; And
conceiving that the Printing and publishing of an abreviat of the saids
Acts duely collected, and laid together, for the better Information and
Instruction of all Our Judges, Officers and Ministers of the Law, and
also of all Our other good Subjects, may be of special Use and
Advantage, for their better Observation and Execution, according to
their full Tenor and Intent: Therefore, and in Answer to an Address,

                "*Per Actam Dominorum Secreti Concilii*.

                                "<span class="smallcaps">Gilb.
Eliot.</span> *Cls. Sci. Concilii*."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[v2\_9:1](dol03.htm#fr_7.md) This is the Act on
which Sir Walter Scott found his story of the "Finn of Mid-Lothian."

<span id="fn_8"></span>[v2\_29:\*](dol03.htm#fr_8.md) How many of our
learned clergy could to-day question anyone in Greek, and how would many
of our bishops feel if they knew that their reputations and lives
depended on their carrying on a conversation in the languages of Hellas?

<span id="fn_9"></span>[v2\_30:\*](dol03.htm#fr_9.md) We learn from the
"Démonomanie" that M. des Niau was the person here referred to in the
first person, and therefore the writer of the book.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[v2\_31:\*](dol03.htm#fr_10.md) The text says:
"Relevant jupes et chemise, montrant ses parties les plus secretes, sans
honte, et se servant de mots lascifs. Ses gestes devinrent si grossiers
que les témoins se cachaient la figure. Elle répétait, en s’ . . . . des
mains, "Venez donc, f . . . . moi!

<span id="fn_11"></span>[v2\_34:\*](dol03.htm#fr_11.md) A curious case is
mentioned in Arnot's Criminal Trials:—

"In 1697 an impostor appeared, in the character of a person tormented by
witches, Christian Shaw, daughter of John Shaw of Bargarran, a gentleman
of some note in the county of Renfrew. She is said to have been hut
eleven years of age. And although it is probable that hysterical
affections may in part have occasioned her rhaphsodies to proceed from
real illusion, as well as accounted for the contortions which agitated
her body; yet she seems to have displayed an artifice above her years,
an address superior to her situation, and to have been aided by
accomplices, which dulness of apprehension, or violence of prejudice,
forbade the bystanders to discover.

"This actress was abundantly pert and lively; and <span id="page_35">p.
35</span> her challenging one of the house-maids for drinking, perhaps
for stealing, a little milk, which drew on her an angry retort, was the
simple prelude to a complicated and wonderful scene of artifice and
delusion, of fanaticism and barbarity.

"In the month of August 1696, <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) within
a few days after her quarrel with the house-maid, the girl was seized
with hysterical convulsions, which in repeated fits displayed that
variety of symptoms which characterise this capricious disease. To
these, other appearances were speedily added, which could only to
attributed to supernatural influence, or to fraud and imposition. She
put out of her mouth quantities of egg-shells, orange-pill, feathers of
wild, and bones of tame fowl, hair of various colours, hot coal-cinders,
straws, crooked pins, &c.

"Having by those sensible objects impressed the publick with the most
complete and fearful conviction of her being 'grievously vexed <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) with a Devil,' she found herself capable
to command the implicit assent of the spectators, in matters that were
repugnant to the evidence of their own senses. For this purpose, she
fell upon the device of seeming to possess the <span id="page_36">p.
36</span> faculties of seeing and hearing, in a manner opposite to that
of the rest of mankind. She would address some invisible beings as if
actually present; at other times, in her conversations with those
invisible beings, she would rail at them for telling her that persons
actually present were in the room; protesting that she did not see them,
yet at the same time minutely describing their dress. For instance, she
spake as follows to the chief of her alledged tormentors, Catherine
Campbell, with whom she had the quarrel, and who, to use the language of
those times, was not *discernibly* present: 'Thou sittest with a stick
in thy hand to put into my mouth, but thorough God's strength thou shalt
not get leave: Thou art permitted to torment me, but I trust in God thou
shalt never get my life. I'll let thee see, *Kattie*, there is no
repentance in hell. O what ailed thee to be a witch! Thou sayest it is
but three nights since thou wast a witch. O, if thou would’st repent, it
may be God might give thee repentance, if thou would'st seek it, and
confess; if thou would desire me, I would do what I could; for the Devil
is an ill master to serve,' &c. &c. After that, she took up her Bible,
read passages, and expounded them; and, upon one's offering to take it
from her, she shrieked horribly, exclaiming, 'She would keep her Bible
in spite of all the Devils <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> in hell!'
Then she fought, and kicked, and writhed herself, as if struggling with
some invisible tormentor. When the sheriff-depute of the county,
accompanied by a macer of Justiciary, carne to apprehend some of the
persons whom her diabolical malice had accused, and were actually in her
presence, she addressed an imaginary and invisible correspondent thus:
'Is the sheriff come? Is he near me?' (Then stretching forth her hand,
as if to grope, and the sheriff putting his hand into hers, she
proceeded:) '*I cannot feel the sheriff*. How can he be present here? or
how can I have him by the hand, as thou sayest, seeing I feel it not?
Thou sayest he has brown coloured cloaths, red plush breeches, with
black stripes, flowered muslin cravat, and an embroidered sword-belt:
Thou sayest there is an old gray haired man with him, having a ring upon
his hand; but I can neither see nor feel any of them. What, *are they
come to apprehend the gentlewoman?* Is this their errand indeed?'

"These reiterated and aweful exercises of the dominion of Satan (for
such they were universally deemed), impressed all ranks with amazement
and terror. The clergy, as was their duty, were the foremost to embrace
the cause of a disciple that was engaged in more than spiritual warfare
with the grand enemy. Clergymen, by rotation, attended the afflicted
<span id="page_38">p. 38</span> damsel, to assist the minister of the
parish, the family of Bargarran, and other pious Christians, in the
expiatory offices of fasting and prayer. A publick fast was ordained by
authority of the presbytery. Three popular clergymen successively
harangued the trembling audience; and one of them chose for his theme
this awful text, "Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea,
for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
knoweth that he hath but a short time. *And when the dragon saw that he
was cast down unto the earth, he persecuted the woman*." <span
id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) And the prayers and exhortations of the
church were speedily seconded with the weight of the secular arm.

"On the 19th of January, a warrant of Privy Council was issued, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md) which set forth, that there were pregnant
grounds of suspicion of witchcraft in the shire of Renfrew, especially
from the afflicted aril extraordinary condition of Christian Shaw,
daughter of John Shaw of Bargarran. It therefore granted commission to
Alexander Lord Blantyre, Sir John Maxwell of Pollock, Sir John Shaw of
Greenock, William Cunnyngham of Craigens, Alexander Porterfield of
Duchall, —— Caldwall of Glanderstoun, Gavin <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> Cochrane of Thornlymuir, Alexander Porterfield of Fullwaod,
and Robert Semple sheriff-depute of Renfrew, or any five of them, to
interrogate and imprison persons suspected of witchcraft, to examine
witnesses, &c. but not upon oath, and to transmit their report before
the 10th of March. The act of Privy Council is subscribed thus,
'Polwarth *Cancellar*, Argyle, Leven, Forfar, Raith, Belhaven, Ja.
Steuart, J. Hope, W. Anstruther, J. Maxwell, Ro. Sinclair.'

"In the report which was presented on the 9th of March, the
commissioners represented that there were 'twenty-four persons male and
female suspected and accused of [witchcraft](errata.htm#9.md),' and that
further inquiry ought to be made into this crime. Among these unhappy
objects of suspicion, it is to be remarked, that there was 'a girl of
fourteen, and a boy not twelve years of age.' Agreeable to this report,
a new warrant was issued by the Privy Council to most of the
commissioners formerly named, with the addition of Lord Hallcraig, Mr.
Francis Montgomery of Giffin, Sir John Houston of that Ilk, Mr John
Kincaid of Corsbasket, Advocate, and Mr John Stewart younger of
Blackhall, Advocate, or any five of them, to meet at Renfrew, Paisley,
or Glasgow, to take trial of judge, and do justice upon the foresaid
persons; and to sentence the guilty 'to be burned or
[otherwise](errata.htm#10.md) executed to death, <span id="page_40">p.
40</span> ordained the commissioners to transmit to the Court of
Justiciary an authentick extract of their proceedings, to be entered
upon its records; and contained a recommendation to the Lords of the
Treasury to defray the expences of the trial. The act is subscribed,
Polwarth *Cancellar*. Douglass, Lauderdale, Annandale, Yester, Kintore,
Carmichael, W. Anstruther, Arch. Mure.'

"The commissioners, thus empowered, were not remiss in acting under the
authority delegated to them. After twenty hours were spent in the
examination of witnesses, who *gave testimony* that the
*malefices* <span id="fr_16"></span>[5](#fn_16.md) libelled could not have
proceeded from natural causes, and that the prisoners were the authors
of these malefices.—After five of the unhappy prisoners confessed their
own guilt, and criminated their alledged associates—after counsel had
been heard on both sides, and the counsel for the prosecution had
declared, that 'he would not press the jury with the *ordinary severity
of threatening an assize of error:*' <span id="fr_17"></span>[6](#fn_17.md)
But recommended to them to proceed according to the evidence; and <span
id="page_41">p. 41</span> loudly declared to them, that although they
ought to beware of condemning the innocent, yet if they should acquit
the prisoners, in opposition to legal evidence, 'they would be accessory
to all the blasphemies, apostacies, murders, tortures, and seductions,
whereof these enemies of heaven and earth should hereafter be guilty.'
After the jury had spent six hours in deliberation, seven of those
miserable persons were condemned to the flames. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[7](#fn_18.md)

"The time however fast approached, when these human sacrifices were to
be abolished. The last person who was prosecuted before the Lords of
Justiciary for witchcraft was Elspeth Rule, who was tried before Lord
Anstruther at the Dumfries circuit, on the 3d of May, 1709. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[8](#fn_19.md) No special act of
[witchcraft](errata.htm#11.md) was charged against her; the indictment was
of a very general nature, that the prisoner was 'habit and repute' <span
id="fr_20"></span>[9](#fn_20.md) <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> (that is,
generally holden and deemed) a witch; and that she had used threatening
expressions against persons at enmity with her, who were afterwards
visited with the loss of cattle, or the death of friends, and one of
whom run mad. The jury, by a majority of voices, [found](errata.htm#12.md)
these articles proved, and the Judge ordained the prisoner to be burned
on the cheek, and to be banished Scotland for life. The last person who
was brought to the stake in Scotland for the crime of witchcraft was
condemned by Captain David Ross of Little Daan <span
id="fr_21"></span>[10](#fn_21.md) sheriff-depute of Sutherland, A.D. 1722.

"Besides in the sufferings, and tragical end of the persons already
specified, human ingenuity seems to have been exhausted in devising
variety of torment, against other persons who lay under the suspicion of
witchcraft, and who persisted, with astonishing fortitude, in denying
the absurd imputation, even when urged with the sharpest tortures. <span
id="page_43">p. 43</span>

From the universal and excessive abhorrence entertained at a witch, a
suspicion of that crime, independent of judicial severities, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[11](#fn_22.md) was sufficient to render the unhappy
object anxious for death.—Thrusting of pins into the flesh, and keeping
the accused from sleep, were the ordinary treatment of a witch. But if
the prisoner was endued with uncommon fortitude, other methods were used
to extort confession. The 'boots,' the 'caspie-claws,' and the
'pilniewinks, engines for torturing the legs, the arms, and the fingers,
were applied to either sex; and that with such violence, that sometimes
the blood would have spouted from the limbs. Loading with heavy irons,
and whipping with cords, till the skin and flesh were torn from the
bones, have also been the adopted methods of torment.

The bloody zeal of those inquisitors attained to a refinement in cruelty
so shocking to humanity, <span id="fr_23"></span>[12](#fn_23.md) and so
<span id="page_44">p. 44</span> repugnant to justice, as to be almost
incredible. Not satisfied with torturing *the person* of the accused,
their ingenious malice assailed the more delicate feelings, and ardent
affections of the *mind*. An aged husband, an infant daughter, would
have been tortured in presence of the accused, in order to subdue her
resolution.—Nay, death itself <span id="fr_24"></span>[13](#fn_24.md) did
not screen the remains of those miserable persons from the malice of
their prosecutors. If an unfortunate woman, trembling at a citation for
witchcraft, ended her sufferings by her own hands, she was dragged from

<span id="fn_17"></span>[v2\_34:6](dol03.htm#fr_17.md) This was an oblique
and most scandalous menace. "Assizes of Error" were declared a grievance

those who committed them to the flames.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[v2\_34:9](dol03.htm#fr_20.md) "Habit and repute"
is a very dangerous doctrine of the law of Scotland, at that time in
full force, by which a man might be hanged altho’ hardly any charge were
exhibited against him, but that he had a bad character. For instance, if
a man was charged with stealing a pair of old shoes, value threepence,
and with being <span id="page_42">p. 42</span> "habit and repute" a
thief, if the jury found such indictment proved, or such prisoner
guilty, the Court would by law be bound to sentence the prisoner to be
hanged; if my temerity may be pardoned, for supposing that any such
thing exists as a precise established ruin of criminal law in Scotland.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[v2\_34:10](dol03.htm#fr_21.md) It is no small
disappointment to me that I cannot lay this trial before the reader. The
Sheriff Court books of the county of Sutherland were carried off by the
Sheriff Clerk about 1735. I am somewhat however consoled for my
disappointment, by the politeness shown me by James Traill, Esq. of
Hobbister, Advocate, Sheriff-depute of Caithness and Sutherland, who was
so obliging as to make a laborious but ineffectual search to recover the
books.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[v2\_34:12](dol03.htm#fr_23.md) Records of
Justiciary, June 24. 1596. When Alison Balfour was accused of
witchcraft, she was put in the caspie-claws, where she was kept
forty-eight hours; her husband was put in heavy irons, *her son put in
the boots, where he suffered fifty-seven strokes*, and her little
daughter, of about seven years of age, put its the pilniewinks, in her
presence, in order to make her confess.—She did confess.—She retracted
her confession in the course of the trial; and publickly, at <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> her execution, declared that the confession
was extorted from her by the torments.—The mode of tormenting and
executing those miserable women is further illustrated by the authentic
account of the expence of burning a witch at Burncastle, near Lauder,
A.D. 1649.
