# THE DEMONOLOGY OF NORTHERN EUROPE.

THE religion of the Teutons was in the main a religion of fighters, and
we do not hesitate to say that they, more than any other people on
earth, developed the ethics of struggle. War, strife, and competition,
are frequently regarded as in themselves detestable and immoral, but the
Teutons discovered that life means strife, and that therefore courage is
the root of all virtue. Their highest ideal was not to shrink from the
unavoidable, but to face it squarely and unflinchingly. Their chief god
was the god of war, and their noblest consummation of life was death on
the battlefield. They despised the coward who was afraid of wounds and
death. They respected and even honored their enemies if they were but
brave. They scorned deceit and falsity and would rather be honestly
defeated than gain a victory by trickery. And this view did not remain a
mere theory with them, but was practised in life. The Teutons were
repeatedly defeated by the Romans, by Marius, Cæsar, and others who were
less scrupulous in their methods of fighting, but in the long run they
remained victorious and built a Teutonic empire upon the debris of Rome.

</span>

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

The idea of evil played an important part in the religion of the
Teutons.

Loki, the god of fire, the cunning mischief-maker among the Asas, is
believed to have brought sin and evil into the world. In the younger
Edda, Loki takes part in the creation of man, whom he endows with the
senses, passions, and evil desires. Loki's children are (1) the Fenris
wolf, (2) the Jormungander, i. e., the Midgard serpent, and (3) Hel, the
queen of Nifelheim, the world of the dead.

Loki induced the gods to build fortifications, for which the architect,
who was one of the giants and an enemy of the gods, should, if he
finished his work in a stipulated time, receive as remuneration Freyja,
the goddess of beauty and love. But when it became apparent that the
walls would be soon completed, Loki, true to his treacherous character,
assisted the gods in cheating the architect. He further helped the giant
Thjasse to steal Idun with her immortality-giving golden apples. Only
when the gods threatened to punish him did he become accessory in
bringing Idun back again. The worst deed which Loki accomplished was the
death of Baldur, the god of light and purity. After that he was outlawed
and resided no longer in Asgard. But he came back and mocked the gods
when they were assembled at Ægir's banquet. At last he was captured and
in punishment for his crimes tied upon three pointed rocks right beneath
the mouth of a serpent. Sigyn, Loki's wife, remains with him to catch
the dripping venom in a bowl, which from time to time she empties.
Whenever the bowl is withdrawn the venom drops into Loki's face

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

and he writhes with pain, which makes the world tremble in what men call
earthquakes.

RAGNAROK, OR THE DOOMSDAY OF THE TEUTONS (By Johannes Gehrts.)  
</span>

The most remarkable feature of Teutonic mythology is the conception of
doomsday or Ragnarok (the twilight

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

of the gods), boding a final destruction of the world, including all the
gods. At present the powers of evil are fettered and subdued, but the
time will come when they will be set loose. Loki, the Fenris wolf, the
Midgard serpent, and Hel, with their army of frost giants and other evil
beings, will approach; Heimdall, the watchman of the gods, will blow his
horn, and the Asas prepare for battle. The combat on the field Vigrid
will be internecine, for the Asas are to die while killing the monsters
of wickedness whom they encounter, and the flames of Muspil will devour
the wrecks of the universe.

The world had a beginning, it therefore must come to an end; but when
the world is destroyed a new heaven and a new earth will rise from the
wreck of the old one, and the new world will be better than the old one.
Leifthraser and his wife Lif (representing the desire for Life and
potential Life) remained concealed during the catastrophe in Hodmimer's
grove and were not harmed by the flames. They now become the parents of
a new race that will inhabit the new abode, called *Gimel* (the German
*Himmel*), and among them will be found Odhin with his sons, Thor,
Baldur, Fro, and all the other Asas.

*Christianity Teutonised*.

When Christianity spread over Northern Europe it came into contact with
the Teutonic and Celtic nations, who added new ideas to its system and
transformed several characteristic features of its world-view.
Christianity to-day is essentially a Teutonic religion. The ethics of
Christianity, which formerly was expressed in the sentence "Resist not
evil," began, in agreement with the

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

combative spirit of the Teuton race, more and more to emphasise the
necessity of struggle. Not only was the figure of Christ conceived after
the model of a Teutonic war-king, the son of the emperor, while his
disciples became his faithful vassals; not only did the archangels
assume the features of the Asas, the great northern gods, Wodan, Donar,
Fro, and others; not only were the old pagan feasts changed into
Christian festivals; the Yuletide became Christmas and the Ostara feast
in the spring was celebrated in commemoration of Christ's resurrection;
but the individual features of the evil powers of the North were also
transferred to Satan and his host.

Teutonic legends and fairy tales frequently mention the Devil, and there
he possesses many features that remind us of Loki. In addition, the ice
giants of the Norsemen, the Nifelheim of the Saxons, the Nether-world of
the Irish, all contributed their share to the popular notions of the
Christian demonology of the Middle Ages. The very name "hell" is a
Teutonic word which originally signified a hollow space or a cave
underground, and denotes the realm of Hel, Loki's daughter. The weird
and terrible appearances of the gods, too, were retained for the
adornment of demoniacal legends; and Odhin as storm-god became "the wild
hunter."

Dr. Ernst Krause, who is best known under his *nom de plume* of Carus
Sterne, has undertaken the work of proving the Northern influence upon
Southern fairy tales and legends. <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)
He finds that all the myths which symbolise the death and resurrection
of the sun, giving

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

rise to the idea of immortality, doomsday, and the final restoration of
the world, have originated in Northern countries where on Christmas day
the sun that seemed lost returns spreading again light and life. Our
philologists believe that the Nibelungenlied contains features of
Homer's great epics; but, according to Dr. Krause, it would seem that
the original source of the Nibelungenlied is older than Homer, and that
the theme of the Völuspa, the first song of the Edda, being a vision
that proclaims the final destruction and degeneration of heaven and
earth, antedates Christ's prophecies of the coming judgment. (Matt.,
24.) Christianity comes to us from the Orient, but the idea that a God
will die and be resurrected is of Northern origin.

Dr. Krause proceeds to prove that the conception of hell as depicted in
Dante's *Divina Comedia*, which may be regarded as the classical
conception of Roman Catholic Christianity, is in all its essential
elements the product of a Northern imagination. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) Dante followed closely Teutonic
traditions, which in his time had become a common possession in the
Christian world through the writings of Saxo Grammaticus, Beda
Venerabilis, Albericus, Caedmon, Caesarius of Heisterbach, and others.
It is specially noteworthy that the deepest hell of Dante's Inferno is
not, as Southern people are accustomed to describe the place of torture,
a burning sulphur lake, but the wintry desolation of an ice-palace. That
this ice hell can be traced back to the days of Gnosticism would only
prove that this Northern influence may, in many of its most
characteristic features, date back to a prehistoric age.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

Dante's vision is by no means the product of his own imagination. It
embodies a great number of old traditions. Dante reproduced in his
description of Satan and hell the mythological views of the North so
popular in his days. His cantos not only remind us of Ulysses's and
Virgil's journey to the Nether-world, but also and mainly of Knight
Owain's descent into St. Patrick's Purgatory

<span id="img_24800"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![DANTE'S ICE HELL.

DANTE'S ICE HELL. (By Gustave Doré.)  
</span>

in Ireland, and of the vision of hell as described by Beda, Albericus,
and Chevalier Tundalus. In the last song of the Inferno, Dante describes
the residence of the sovereign of hell, which is surrounded by a thick
fog, so as to make it necessary for the poet to be led by the hand of
his guide. There the ice-palace stands almost inaccessible through the
cold blizzards that blow about it; and

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

there the ruler of hell and his most cursed fellows stand with their
bodies partly frozen in the transparent ice.

Dante's portraiture of the evil demon whom he calls "Dis" agrees exactly
with the appearance of the principal Northern deity of evil, as he was
commonly revered among the Celts, the Teutons, and the Slavs. Dis has
three faces: one in front, and one on each side. The middle face is red,
that on the right side whitish-yellow, that on the left side, black.
Thus the trinity idea was transferred to Satan on account of the
ill-shaped idols of the crude art of Northern civilisation. Dante's
description of Dis reminds us not only of the three-headed hoar-giant of
the Edda, Hrim-Grimnir, who lives at the door of death, but also of the
trinity of various pagan gods, especially of Triglaf, the triune deity
of the Slavs.

When Bishop Otto of Bamberg converted the Pomeranians to Christianity,
he broke, in 1124, the three-headed Triglaf idol in the temple of
Stettin and sent its head to Pope Honorius II. at Rome. Dr. Krause
suggests that since Dante, who as an ambassador of Florence visited Rome
in 1301, must have seen with his own eyes the head of the Pomeranian
Triglaf, it is by no means impossible that he used it as a prototype for
the description of his trinitarian Satan.

*The Giants*.

It is interesting to observe the transformation of the old Teutonic
giants who were plain personifications of the crude forces of nature,
into Christian devils. Northern mythology represents the giants, be they
mountain-giants, storm-giants, frost-giants, fog-giants, or what not,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

as stupid, and they are frequently conquered by the wisdom of the gods,
or by human cunning and invention. There are innumerable legends which
preserve the old conception and simply replace the names of giants by
devils; and we can observe that all the conquests of man over nature
are, in the old sense of the Teutonic mythology, described as instances
in which giants or devils are outwitted in one way or another.

Tile giants, as representatives of mountains, forests, rivers, lakes,
and the soil of the earth, are always bent on collecting the rent that
is due to the owner of the land, for men are merely tenants of the
earth, which by right belongs to the giants. The giants envy men their
comfort and try to destroy their work. Thus the fog-giant Grendel
appears at night-time in the hall of King Hrodhgar and devours at each
visit thirty men. Beowulf, the sun-hero, fights with him and cuts off
his arm; he then encounters Grendel's mother, the giantess of the marsh
whence the fog rises, and finally succeeds in killing both Grendel and
his mother.

The parades of giant families which form an important feature of Dutch
and Flemish carnivals may be a relic of older customs representing
visits of the lords of the ground collecting their rents, which is given
in refreshments while the people sing the giant-song <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) with the refrain:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*"Keer u eens om, reuzjen, reuzjen!"*  
\[Return once more little giant, little giant.\]</span>

</div>

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

*Burying Alive*.

The privilege of collecting rent which the forces of nature, be they
gods, demons, or giants, and later on in their stead, the Devil, were
supposed to possess, led to the idea of offering sacrifices in payment
of the debt due to the powerful and evil-minded landlords, the owners of
the soil. And this notion resulted in the superstition of burying alive
either human beings or animals, a practice which at a certain stage of
civilisation probably was all but universal and received even the
sanction of the God of Israel. <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)

Grimm says (*Mythology*, p. 109):

<span class="small">"Frequently it was regarded as necessary to entomb
within the foundation of a building living creatures and even men, an
act which was regarded as a sacrifice to the soil which had to endure
the weight of the structure. By this cruel custom people hoped to attain
permanence and stability for great buildings."</span>

There are innumerable stories which preserve records of this barbaric
custom, and there can be no doubt that many of them are historical and
that the practice continued until a comparatively recent time. We read
in Thiele (*Dänische Volkssagen*, I., 3) that the walls of Copenhagen
always sank down again and again, although they were constantly rebuilt,
until the people took an innocent little girl, placed her on a chair
before a table, gave her toys and sweets, and while she merrily played,
twelve masons covered the vault and finished the wall, which since that
time remained stable. Scutari is said to have

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

been built in a similar way. A ghost appeared while the fortress was in
the process of building, and demanded that the wife of one of the three
kings who should bring the food to the masons on the next day should be
entombed in the foundation. Being a young mother, she was permitted to
nurse her baby, and a hole was left for that purpose which was closed as
soon as the child was weaned.

We read in F. Nork's *Sitten und Gebräuche* (*Das Kloster*, Vol. XII.)
that when in 1813 the ice broke the dam of the river Elbe and the
engineers had great trouble in repairing it, an old man addressed the
dike-inspector, saying: "You will never repair the dike unless you bury
in it an innocent little child," and Grimm adduces even a more modern
instance (*Sagen*, p. 1095) which dates from the year 1843. "When the
new bridge in Halle was built," Grimm tells us, "the people talked of a
child which should be buried in its foundations."

So long did these superstitions continue after the cruel rite had been
abandoned; and they were held, not only in spite of the higher morality
which Christianity taught, but even in the name of Christianity. In
Tommaseo's *Canti Populari* an instance is quoted of the voice of an
archangel from heaven bidding the builders of a wall entomb the wife of
the architect in its foundation. The practice is here regarded as
Christian and it is apparent that there are instances in which Christian
authorities were sufficiently ignorant to sanction it, for even the
erection of churches was supposed to require the same cruel sacrifice;
and there were cases in which, according to the special sanctity of the
place, it was deemed

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

necessary to bury a priest, because children or women were not regarded
as sufficient. In Günther's *Sagenbuch des Deutschen Volkes* (Vol. I.,
p. 33 ff.) we read that the Strassburg cathedral required the sacrifice
of two human lives, and that two brothers lie buried in its foundation.

*The Power of Evil Outwitted.*

The presence of all the big bowlders that lie scattered in the low lands
of Germany is attributed either to giants or to the devils; they are
sometimes said to be sand-grains which giants removed from their shoes,
or they were thrown down in anger when they found themselves cheated out
of their own by the wit of mortals.

There is a *Märchen* of a farmer who undertook to till heretofore
uncultivated ground and the Devil (that is to say, the giant who owned
the land and had seen nothing except sterile rocks and desolate deserts)
gazed with astonishment at the green plants that sprang from the earth.
He demanded half the crop, and the farmer left him his choice whether he
would take the upper or the lower half. When the Devil chose the lower
half, the farmer planted wheat, and when the upper half, he planted
turnips, leaving him now the stubble and now the useless turnip tops.
Whichever way the Devil turned he was outwitted. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)

The story came in its migration south to Arabia, where it was discovered
by Friedrich Rückert, who retold it in his poem "The Devil
Outwitted," <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) which Mr. E.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> F. L. Gauss, of
Chicago, has kindly translated for the special purpose of quotation in
this connection:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The Arabs tilled their fields align,  
    Then came the Devil in a flare  
Protesting: 'Half the world is mine,  
    Of your crops, too, I want my share.'

"The Arabs said, for they are sly,  
    'The lower half we'll give to thee,'  
But the Devil, always aiming high,  
    Replied: 'It shall the upper be!'

"They turnips sowed all o'er their field,  
    And when he came to share the crop,  
The Arabs took the subsoil yield,  
    And the Devil got the turnip tops.

"And when another year came round  
    The Devil spoke in wrathful scorn:  
'To have the lower half I'm bound!'  
    The Arabs then sowed wheat and corn,

"When came the time again to share,  
    The Arabs took the sheaves pell-mell,  
The Devil took the stubbles bare  
    And fed with them the fire of hell."

</div>

There are innumerable other legends of stupid devils. A miller of the
Devil-mill in Kleinbautzen tied the Devil to the water-wheel. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) A smith who for his hospitality once had
a wish granted by Christ, bewitched the Devil and placed Lucifer, the
chief of devils, on his anvil, which frightened him so much that the
smith, when he died, was not admitted to hell. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_127.md) And there is a humorous German folk-song
of a tailor, which begins:

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">A tailor went to wander,  
    On Monday, in the morn,  
And there he met the Devil,  
    His clothes and shoes all torn.  
Hey, tailor, follow me  
In hell the boys need thee;  
    For thou must clothe the devils  
Whatever the cost may be.</span>

</div>

The tailor, on arriving in hell, maltreated all the devils with his
tailor utensils in the attempt at dressing

them, and they swore that they would never again allow a tailor to come
near them, even though he might have stolen ever so much cloth. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)

Another comical story is told of Dunstan, abbot of Glaston, later
archbishop of Canterbury. While busily

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

engaged in the fabrication of a Eucharist cup, the Devil suddenly
appeared to him. But the saint was not afraid; he took the pincers out
of the fire and seized the nose of Satan, who ran off with a howl and
never again dared to molest him. The event is commemorated in an old
rhyme, thus:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"St. Dunstan, as the story goes,  
Once pulled the Devil by the nose  
With red-hot tongs, which made him roar  
That he was heard three miles or more."</span>

</div>

An act of bravery is told of St. Cuthbert. Sir Guy Le Scoope (as Thomas
Ingoldsby tells us, closely following the chronicle of Bolton) expected
company, but finding at the appointed hour the banquet hall empty,
because the guests had been kept away through a bad joke of the inviting
messenger, he called on the Devil and ten thousand fiends to eat the
dinner and take all that was there with them to the infernal regions.
The Devil came with his devilish company and all the folk of Sir Guy
fled, leaving the little heir behind, who was at once seized by Black
Jim, the leader of the fiendish company. In his anxiety Sir Guy cried to
St. Cuthbert of Bolton, who actually made his appearance in the shape of
ail old palmer and forced the demoniac crowd to surrender the child, but
he generously allowed them to remain as the guests of Sir Guy, adding:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"'But be moderate, pray,--and remember thus much,  
Since you're treated as Gentlemen, shew yourselves such,  
    And don't make it late, But mind and go straight  
Home to bed when you've finished--and don't steal the plate!  
Nor wrench of the knocker--or bell from the gate. <span id="page_257">p.

Walk away, like respectable Devils, in peace,  
And don't "lark" with the watch or annoy the police!

While the Demons all set up a 'Hip! hip! hurray!'

Still another story of saintly courage is told of St. Medard, who while
once promenading on the shore of

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

One of the oldest triumphs of human skill in bridge-building gave rise
to the *Märchen* of the Devil's Bridge which boldly overspans the
yawning gorge of the Reuss where the mountain road passes up to the
furca of the St. Gotthard. A new bridge has been built by engineers of
the nineteenth century right above the old one; but the old one remained
for a long time in its place, until it broke down in recent years. The
legend goes that a shepherd-lad engaged the Devil to build the bridge on
the condition that the soul of the first living creature that crossed it
should be forfeited. When the work was finished the lad drove a chamois
over the bridge, which, seeing that he was cheated out of the price he
had expected, the Devil wrathfully tore into pieces. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_129.md)

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

All these stories are Christianised pagan notions of evil conquered
either through cleverness and wit or by divine assistance; and even the
church doctrines of sin

OVER THE REUSS.](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/26000.jpg.md)  
THE DEVIL'S BRIDGE OVER THE REUSS.  
</span>

and salvation are based upon pre-Christian conceptions ultimately dating
back to human sacrifices and the mystic rites of cannibalism in which
man hoped to partake of

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

divinity and immortality by eating the flesh and drinking the blood of
his incarnated God or his representative.

The Christian scheme of salvation may be briefly called the vicarious
atonement of man's sin through the blood of Christ. God's wrath upon the
guilty human race is purified through the sufferings and death of the
innocent god-man. Divine Justice is satisfied by the sacrifice of Divine
Love.

The mystery of this doctrine and also of the doctrine of original sin,
which in its literal sense can hardly be regarded as commendable, has a
deep sense which appears when we consider the organic unity of the human
race. We not only inherit the evil consequences of our ancestors' evil
deeds, but we actually consist of their evil dispositions themselves.
Thus the sin of our fathers is our curse because it is our own, and, in
the same way, the merit of our brothers becomes, or may become, our own
blessing. We can easily share in the benefit that will accrue from
inventions or other advances made by one man if we are only willing to
accept the lesson which his example teaches.

The idea of a salvation through vicarious atonement has grown dimmer of
late. The old interpretation reminding us of the bloody sacrifices of
savages is beginning to wane, although it can scarcely be regarded as
entirely abandoned; it is not surrendered but merely transformed, and
may now be called the idea of salvation through sacrifice.

author. The song may be found in various collections of German
folk-songs. Its first verse runs:

Es wollt ein Schneider wandern,  
Des Montags in der Fruh.  
Begegnet ihm der Teufel,  
Hat weder Weider noch Schuh.

He, he, du Schneidergesöll,  
Du musst mit mir zur Höll,  
Du sollst die Teufel kleiden,  
Es koste was es wöll."
