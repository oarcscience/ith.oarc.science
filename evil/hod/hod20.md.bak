# THE PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL.

THE question as to the nature of evil is by far the most important
problem for philosophical, religious, and moral consideration. The
intrinsic presence of suffering is the most obvious feature that
determines the character of existence throughout, but gives at the same
time origin to the most important blessings that make life worth living.
It is pain that sets thoughts to thinking; a state of undisturbed
happiness would make reflexion, inquiry, and invention redundant. It is
death which begets the aspiration of preserving oneself beyond the
grave. Without death there would be no religion. And it is sin that
imparts worth to virtue. If there were no going astray, there would be
no seeking for the right path; there would be no merit in goodness.
Blame and praise would have no meaning. In this absence of want,
imperfection, and all kinds of ill, there would be no ideals, no
progress, no evolution to higher goals.

*The Mythology of Evil*.

Mythology being always a popular metaphysics, it is a matter of course
that the idea of evil has been personified

among all nations. There is no religion in the world but has its demons
or evil monsters who represent pain, misery, and destruction. In Egypt
the powers of darkness were feared and worshipped under various names as
Set or Seth, Bess, Typhon, etc. Though the ancient Gods of Brahmanism
are not fully differentiated into evil and good deities, we have yet the
victory of Mahâmâya, the great goddess, over Mahisha, the king of the
giants. <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_232.md) Buddhists call the

extensive than our own.

The conception of evil in its successive personifications would be
humorous if most of its pages (especially those on witch-prosecution)
were not at the same time very sad. But for that reason we must
recognise the prestige of the Devil. The pedigree of the Evil One is
older than the oldest European aristocracy and royal

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

families; it antedates the Bible and is more ancient than the Pyramids.

Having outlined in the preceding chapters the history of the Devil, we
shall now devote the conclusion of this book to a philosophical
consideration of the idea of evil; and here we are first of all
confronted with the problem of the objective existence of evil.

*The Era of Subjectivism*.

The question presents itself: "Is not evil the product of mere illusion?
Is it not a relative term which ought to be dropped as a one-sided
conception of things? Does it not exist simply because we view life from
our own subjective standpoint, and must it not disappear as soon as we
learn to comprehend the world in its objective reality?" The tendency to
regard evil as a purely negative term is at present very prevalent, for
it agrees with the spirit of the times and is one of the most popular
notions of to-day.

In ancient times man was in the habit of objectifying the various
aspirations and impulses of his soul. In order to understand beauty the
Greek mind fashioned the ideal of Aphrodite, and the moral authority of
righteousness appeared to the Jew as Yahveh the Lord, the Legislator of
Mount Sinai. Religious aspirations were actualised in the Church by
means of ceremonials and ecclesiastical institutions.

Things changed at the opening of that era in the evolution of mankind
which is commonly called modern history. A new age was prepared through
the inventions of gunpowder, the compass, and printing, and began at

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

the end of the fifteenth century with the discovery of America, and the
Reformation. The more the horizon of the known world grew, the more man
began to comprehend the importance of his own subjectivity. The tendency
of philosophy since Descartes and of religion since Luther, has been to
concentrate everything in man's individual consciousness. That alone
should have value which had become part of man's soul. Man's
consciousness became his world, and thus, in religion, conscience began
to be regarded as the ultimate basis of conduct. Men felt that religion
should not be an external, but an internal, factor. Toleration became a
universal requirement, and subjectivity was made the cornerstone of
public and private life. Thus the era of the Reformation showed itself
as a revolutionary movement, which, proclaiming the right of
individualism and subjectivity, overthrew the traditional authority of
an external objectivity.

The originators of this movement did not intend to discard all objective
authority, but the spirit of nominalism which dominated them prevailed
over their movement in its further progress. The last consequences of
the principle of subjectivity, which starts with the famous assumption
*cogito ergo sum*, were not anticipated by Descartes, for he naively
assumes objective existence on one of the most trivial arguments. Nor
would Luther with his peculiar education and stubborn narrowness, which
were by no means inconsistent accompaniments of his greatness, ever have
endorsed later theories based upon the purely subjective aspect of
conscience; but the fact remains that the last consequence of the
recognition of

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

the supremacy of the subjective principle is a denial of any objective
authority in philosophy, politics, religion, and ethics, which leads in
politics to anarchism, i. e., individualism pushed to its extreme; in
philosophy to agnosticism, i. e., the denial of any cognisable
objectivity, worked out most systematically in Kant's critical idealism.
In ethics it is the refusal to recognise any objective authority in
morals; which leads either to Bentham's ethical egotism and hedonism or
to intuitionism, and finally to Nietzsche's immoralism.

Our present civilisation is based upon the Protestant ideal of
individualism, and nobody who lives and moves in our time can be blind
to the enormous benefits which we derive from it. Nevertheless, we must
beware of the onesidedness of subjectivism. Objectivism is not so
utterly erroneous in principle as it appears from the point of view of
modern subjectivism. The external methods of the Roman Church are
mistaken; the tyranny of its hierarchical system which substitutes the
priest's authority and an infallible papacy for God's authority is
radically wrong; and the main task of Protestantism consisted in
protesting against this authority, which, in spite of its self-asserted
catholicity, is based upon the human authority of fallible mortals, an
authority that was more frequently misused through bigotry and ignorance
than through malice and selfishness.

There are Protestants who might object that Protestantism is not merely
negative; it is also positive. It is not only a protest, but also an
affirmation. True, indeed! But most of the Protestant affirmations are
simply relies of the old Romanism which bound the consciences

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

of man and crippled his reasoning power. The fanatics among the
Protestants are by no means friends of liberty and free inquiry; and the
positive power, the new factor in history that was destined to build up
a new civilisation, was nothing else than Science. Therefore,
Protestantism is not as yet the last word spoken in the religious
development of mankind. We must look to higher aims and more positive
issues, and a new reformation of the Church will obtain them only on the
condition of its again recognising the importance of objectivity.

Mankind will not return to the dogmatic system of hierarchical
institutions, which would only bind again the consciences of men by
man-made authority. But the fact must be recognised that truth is not a
mere subjective conception; it must be seen that truth is a statement of
facts, and, accordingly, that it contains an objective element, and that
this objective element is the essential part of established truth.

In the old period of objectivism, the ultimate authority was lodged in
great men, prophets, reformers, and priests, whose spirit, after it had
been adapted to the needs of the powerful, was embodied in Church
institutions. The new objectivism discards all human authority; it rests
ultimately upon science, which is an appeal to facts. Truth is no longer
what the Church teaches, or what some infallible man may deem wise to
proclaim; nor is it what appears to me as true, or to you as true; but
it is that which according to methodical critique has been proved to be
objectively true, i. e., so proved that everybody who investigates it
will find it to be so.

Objective truth, demonstrable by evidence and capable

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

of revision, or, in a word, Science, is the highest, the most reliable
and the most valuable revelation of God. God reveals himself in the
facts of life, among which we include our afflictions and personal
experiences; God speaks in our conscience, which is, as it were, the
moral instinct, the result of all our inherited and acquired
experiences, and this is the reason why the voice of conscience makes
itself heard in our soul with that automatic force which is
characteristic of all deep-seated subconscious reactions. God also
appears in our sentiments, our ideal aspirations, our devotions, our
hopes and our yearnings. All these various manifestations are important
and must not be lost sight of; but above them all is the objectivity of
truth which speaks through science.

It is impossible for all men to be scientists, but for that reason it is
not necessary that their minds and hearts should be enslaved by blind
faith. The faith of every man should be the trust in truth, not in fairy
tales that must be taken for granted, but in the truth,--the truth which
in its main outlines is simple enough to be comprehensible to all,--the
truth that this world of ours is a cosmic harmony in which no wrong can
be done without producing evil effects all around.

Faith in the objective authority of truth is the next step in the
religious evolution of mankind. We stand now at the threshold of the
third period which will be, to characterise it in a word, an era of
scientific objectivism. The tendency of the second era was negative,
revolutionising, theorising; the tendency of the third will be positive,
constructive, practical.

Negativism and subjectivism appear from the standpoint

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

of the positivism and objectivism of the first period as the work of the
destroyer, of the negative spirit, the Devil. It is a reaction. This
explains why Milton's Satan actually became a hero. Milton was a
Protestant, a revolutionist, a subjectivist, and he unconsciously
sympathised with Satan, who in the terms of a philosopher of the age
declares:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The mind is its own place and in itself  
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.  
What matter where, if *I* be still the same  
And what I should be."</span>

</span>

The negativism of the second period is not a mistake. It was an
indispensable condition of the third period; for it manufactured the
tools for a higher and better positivism,--criticism. But criticism is
insufficient for positive construction; we must have actual results,
methodical work, and positive issues; and the prophet of the twentieth
century finds it necessary again to emphasise the importance of
objectivity.

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

*Is Evil Positive*?

A modern fable characterises the relativity of good and evil in the
story of a farmer, who, weeding his field with a cultivator, curses the
morning-glories which grow luxuriantly on his maize stalks as being
created by the Devil. In the meantime his little daughter weaves a
wreath of the same flowers and praises the beauty of God's handiwork.
Evil and good may be relative, but relativity does not imply
non-existence. Relations are facts too. If mischief is wrought by good
things being out of place, the evil does not become chimerical but is as
positive as any other reality.

In the same way, the relativity of knowledge does not prove (as some
agnostic philosophers claim) the impossibility of knowledge. Concrete
things, such as stones and other material bodies, are not the only
realities; relations, too, are actual, and the same thing may under
different conditions be either good or evil.

A proper comprehension of the relativity of goodness and badness, far
from invalidating the objectivity of the moral ideal, will become a
great stimulus that will work for the realisation of goodness, for there
ought to be nothing so bad but that it can by judicious management be
turned to good account. Badness, however, is sometimes spoken of as a
mere negation, and the assertion is made that it is not a positive
factor. Looking for the most characteristic representative of this view
among the ablest authors of our time, we find a statement written by the
well-known author of the novel *Ground*

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

*Arms*! Bertha von Suttner, one of the most prominent advocates of
universal peace on earth. She knows as well as Schopenhauer that the
ills of life are positive, for she describes all the horrors of war in
their drastic reality. Nevertheless, Bertha von Suttner devotes in her
ingenious book *The Inventory of a Soul* a whole chapter to the
proposition "The Principle of Evil a Phantom." <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_241.md) She says:

<span class="small">"I do not believe in the phantoms of badness,
misery, and death. They are mere shadows, zeros, nothingnesses. They are
negations of real things, but not real things themselves.... There is
light, but there is no darkness: darkness is only the non-existence of
light. There is life, death is only a local ceasing of life-phenomena. .
. . We grant that Ormuzd and Ahriman, God and Devil, are at least
thinkable, but there are other opposites in which it is apparent that
one is the non-existence of the other. For instance: noise and silence.
Think of a silence so powerful as to suppress a noise. . . . Darkness
has no degree, while light has. There is more light or less light, but
various shades of darkness can mean only little or less light. Thus,
life is a magnitude, but death is a zero. Something and nothing cannot
be in struggle with each other. Nothing is without arms, nothing as an
independent idea is only an abortion of human weaknesses . . . two are
necessary to produce struggle. If I am in the room, I am here; if I
leave it, I am no longer here. There can be no quarrel between my
ego-present and ego-absent."</span>

This is the most ingenious and completest denial of the existence of
evil that we know of, and it is presented with great force. It is the
expression of the negativism of philosophy from Descartes to Spencer. It
seems to be consistent monism. And yet, we cannot accept it.

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

True enough, the idea of a personal Devil is as imaginary as a fairy, or
an elf, or a hobgoblin; true also that there is no evil in itself, and
no goodness in itself; the dualism of the Manichees is untenable. The
evil principle cannot be conceived as an independent substance, essence,
or entity. But for that reason we cannot shut our eyes to its real and
positive existence. Granted that silence is the absence of noise; yet
noise is not goodness, neither is silence badness. While I think or
write, noise is to me an evil, while silence is bliss. Silence, where a
word of cheer is expected or needed, may be a very positive evil, and a
lie is not merely an absence of truth. The absence of food is a mere
negation, but considered in relation to its surroundings, as an empty
stomach, it is hunger; and hunger is a positive factor in this world of
ours. Sickness can be considered as a mere absence of health, but
sickness is caused either by a disorder in the system or the presence of
injurious influences, both of which are unquestionably positive. A debt
is a negative factor in the books of the debtor, but what is negative to
the debtor is positive to the creditor.

If negative ideas were "mere abortions of human weakness," as Bertha von
Suttner claims, how could mathematicians have any use for the minus
sign? And if the idea of evil were an empty superstition, how could its
influence upon mankind have been so lasting? On the one hand it is true
that all existence is positive, but on the other hand we ought to know
that existence in the abstract is neither good nor bad; goodness and
badness depend upon the relations among the various existent things. And
these relations may be good as well as

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

evil. Some existences destroy other existences. Certain bacilli are
destructive of human life, certain antidotes destroy bacilli. There are
everywhere parasites living upon other lives, and what is positive or
life-sustaining to the one is negative and destructive to the other, and
every such negation is a reality, the effectiveness of which neutralises
the action of another reality. <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_242.md)

The idea of goodness is by no means equivalent with existence, and
badness with non-existence. Existence is the reality; it is the
indivisible whole, the one and all. Good and evil, however, are views
taken from a certain given standpoint, and from this standpoint good and
evil are features forming a contrast, but as such they are always
actualities; neither the one nor the other is a mere nothing. The
question is only whether we have a right to regard our own standpoint as
the positive one, representing that which is good, and all the powers
that hinder human life as negative or evil.

The answer to this question seems to be that any and every being will
naturally regard its own standpoint as the positively given fact, and
every factor that destroys it as negative; his pleasure appears to him
the standard of goodness.

And we grant that every being is entitled to take this standpoint, and
that subjectivism naturally forms the initial stage of all ethical
valuation. But we cannot rest satisfied with the principle of subjective
autonomy as a solution of the problem of good and evil.

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

*Is there an Objective Standard of Goodness*?

Supposing that good were indeed simply that which gives pleasure or
enhances my life, and bad that which gives pain or threatens to destroy
it, the standard of goodness and badness would be purely subjective. The
famous savage chief quoted by Tylor, and from Tylor by Spencer, would
have fathomed the problem of good and evil when he declared that "bad is
if anybody took away his wife, but if he took away the wife of some one
else, that would be good." <span id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) Good
would be that which pleases me; and the good as an objective reality
would not exist. There would be something good for me, for you, and for
many others, but what might be good for me might be bad for you.
Goodness and badness would be purely subjective qualities without any
objective value.

The view which bases ethics upon a consideration of pleasure and pain
and defines goodness as that which affords the greatest amount of
pleasurable feelings is called hedonism. The coarsest form of hedonism
(as represented by Bentham) makes the pleasure of the individual
supreme; it bases its ethics upon selfishness, and sees in altruism only
refined egotism. The altruist is said to love but himself in others.

Let me add here that the intuitionalist basing ethics upon the voice of
his conscience is, closely considered, also a hedonist, or at least a
subjectivist, for he finds the ultimate authority for conduct in
himself, viz., in the pleasure of those motor ideas of his which he
calls his

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

conscience: what he is pleased to consider as ethical, he thinks is
ethical. His standard of morality is the subjectivity of his conviction,
which he is unable either to analyse or to trace to its origin. He
differs from Bentham's hedonism of ethical egotism only in this, that
the pleasure of his conscience overrules the lower pleasures of the
senses.

Modern utilitarianism, as represented by Mr. Spencer, remains a purely
subjective ethics, for it makes the greatest happiness of the greatest
number the maxim of ethics; and by doing so it introduces no objective
principle, but it simply proposes to replace every single subjectivity
by the sum total of all subjectivities; and subjective ethical maxims
are not as yet truly ethical; they remain on the level of the
world-conception of Tylor's savage.

All subjective ethical theories fail to see the cardinal point of
ethics, for the very nature of ethics is objective. If there is no
objective authority for moral conduct, we had better openly declare that
ethics is an illusion and what we call ethics is simply all arithmetical
calculation in which pleasures and pains are weighed against one another
and morality is at best only a dietetics of the soul. As a matter of
fact, however, he who opens his eyes will see that there is an objective
authority for conduct in life. Life and the factors in life are not
purely what we make them. Here we are to run a race, and the course of
the individual as much as that of mankind and all living beings is
prescribed in a very definite and unmistakable way on the lines of what
since Darwin we have accustomed ourselves to call evolution. We must
learn to

recognise the necessity of progress which leads us onward on a straight
and narrow path. Those who willingly obey the laws of progress advance
on the path in spite of its thorns, joyously and gladly. The reluctant
are urged forward and feel the smart of nature's whip, while he who
obstinately refuses to heed the laws of the cosmic order goes to the
wall.

Nature has no consideration for our sentiments, be they pleasures or
pains. Happy is he who delights in acting according to her laws. But he
who seeks other pleasures is doomed. Look at the situation from whatever
standpoint you may, the criterion of right and wrong, of good and bad,
of true and false, lies not in the greater or lesser amount of pleasure
and pain, but in the agreement of our actions with the cosmic order; and
morality is that which is in accord with the law of evolution. Ethics
teaches us to do voluntarily what after all we must do whether or not it
may please us.

In a word, ethics is unthinkable without duty, and the essential element
of duty is its objective reality, its inflexible sternness, and its
austere authority.

We say to the hedonist, a good action is not moral because it gives
pleasure, but because it accords with duty; and we must not be on the
search for that which gives us pleasure but must endeavor to find our
highest pleasure in doing that which the cosmic law (or, religiously
speaking, God) demands of us.

Those who deny that there is any objective norm of right and wrong in
the universe, are inclined to claim with Huxley, that man survived not
on account of his morality, but on the contrary, on account of his
immorality.

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It has been said
that man is more rapacious, more egotistical, more immoral, than brutes.
Without denying that an immoral man may sometimes appear more brutish
than a brute, we cannot see that man is as immoral as, or even more
immoral than, brutes. But the case is worth considering.

Says the wolf in Æsop's fable: "Why is it right for you to eat the lamb,
when for me it is supposed to be wrong?" Is not man in the same
predicament as the wolf, and does not mankind slaughter more animals
than all the wolves in the world ever ate?

Granted that the wolf's pleadings are substantiated, we observe that man
lives, but wolves are exterminated, which seems good evidence in favor
of man's being in greater accord with the cosmic laws. And yet the
actions of both, the wolf and the man, seem to be identical; or rather,
if the blackness of a crime depended upon quantitative measurement by
addition, we should have to decide in favor of the wolves; for man at
the present time kills more sheep, pigs, and other animals in one year
than wolves could devour in a century. Yet man possesses the impudence
to call the wolf a robber and to drive him from the fold whenever he
attempts to imitate man's voracity. What is the justification of
slaughter in the one case, and what its condemnation in the other?

In answering this question we shall not idealise man's mode of living on
the flesh of his fellow-creatures. For it appears that from a moral
standpoint it would be preferable to sustain life without slaughtering
lambs and calves, fowl and fishes. The case must not be considered from
an abstract or ideal standpoint, but simply treated

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

as a comparison of the wolf's conduct with man's conduct; and we find
that the more sheep a man eats, the more he raises. The wolf eats them
without raising them. The wolf murders the lamb. However, the slaughter
of the lamb by man is no murder, for it serves to increase and to
sustain human souls, and the souls of man possess more truth and a
higher insight into nature. The lamb dies as a sacrifice on the altar of
humanity, and this sacrifice is right and good if, and in so far as, it
substitutes higher life for lower life. Subjectively considered the wolf
has the same right as man to kill a lamb; and also the same right as the
lamb would have to kill wolves or men. The difference between man's and
the wolf's actions appears only when we take into account the objective
conditions of man's superiority, giving him a wider dominion of power
which he can maintain because his soul is a better reflector of truth
than are the notions of a wolf.

We must insist here that the attainment of a higher life, consisting in
a fuller comprehension of truth and a greater acquisition of power, is
one of the most essential requisites of morality. Morality is not a
negative quality, but a very positive endeavor. We must abandon the old
standpoint of negativism, that goodness consists in not doing certain
things which are forbidden. Genuine goodness consists in daring and
doing; and in doing the right thing. One genuine and positive virtue
atones for many sins that consist in mere omissions. The sheep is by no
means (as is frequently claimed) more moral than the wolf. The wolf is
bad enough, but he is at least courageous and keen; the sheep is a
coward, and with

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

all its cowardice it is stupid. It is time to discard the ovine ideal of
morality which praises all lack of energy and of accomplishments as the
highest type of goodness. What we need is a positive conception of
virtue based upon a careful consideration of the requirements of life.

What higher life and lower life is cannot be declared to be an arbitrary
distinction. It is not purely subjective, but can be defined according
to an objective standard. Good to the savage is that which pleases him,
and bad that which hurts him. Good, to him who has deciphered the
religious mystery of the universe and understands the nature of God, is
that which produces higher life, and bad is that which hinders, or
perverts, or destroys it.

*The God-Idea*.

God is a religious term, and it is often claimed that knowledge of God
does not fall within the domain of science; the idea of God and all
other religious terms are claimed to be extra-scientific. Thus there are
two parties both of which are under the influence of nominalistic
subjectivism: religious agnostics and infidel agnostics. The belief of
the former is as irrational as the disbelief of the latter. If there is
an objective authority for conduct, we must be able to know it; we can
obey it only in so far as we know it. Now experience teaches us that
there is an authority for conduct, and the theory of evolution promises
to prove it by positive evidence. This authority for conduct is called
in the language of religion "God." Our scientists formulate under the
name "laws of nature" that which is immutable in the various phenomena,
that which is universal in the variety of happenings, that

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

which is eternal in the transient, and every law of nature is in its
sphere a rigorous authority for conduct which in this sense is part and
parcel of God's being.

The most important laws of nature in the ethical domain are those which
regulate all the various and sometimes very delicate relations of man to
man, which concatenate our fates and set soul to soul in a mutually
helpful responsion.

Existence is one harmonious entirety; there is not a thing in the world
but is embraced in the whole as a part

of the whole. The One and All is the condition of every creature's
being; it is the breath of our breath, the sentiency of our feelings,
the strength of our strength. Nothing exists of itself or to itself. All
things are interrelated; and as all masses are held together by their
gravity in a mutual attraction, so there is at the bottom of all
sentiment a mysterious longing, a yearning for the fulness of the whole,
a panpathy which finds a powerful utterance in the psalms of all the
religions on earth. No

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>

creature is an isolated being, for the whole of existence affects the
smallest of its parts. Says Emerson:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All are needed by each one,  
Nothing is fair or good alone."</span>

</div>

The unity of the whole, the intercoherence of all things, the oneness of
all norms that shape life, is not a

THE FALLEN LUCIFER. (After Doré.)  
</span>

mere theory but an actual reality; and in this sense the scriptural
saying "God is Love" is a truth demonstrable by natural science.

Science proves that the whole of existence presents itself throughout as
regulated by law; that it is not a chaos, not an incomprehensible
riddle, but a cosmos. As a cosmos it is intelligible, and sentient
creatures can

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

learn to understand its nature and adapt themselves to it. God is that
feature in the world which conditions and produces reason; and reason is
nothing but a reflexion of the world-order. The cosmic order of
existence, the harmony of its laws, its systematic regularity, makes
intelligence possible, and sentient beings will naturally develop into
minds. God is that which changes individuals into persons, for reason
and a rational will are the essential characteristic of personality.

Taking this ground we say, (adopting here, for the sake of simplicity,
the religious term God,) those beings are good which are images of God.

The nature of progress is not (as Mr. Spencer has it) an increase of
heterogeneity, but growth of soul. Evolution is not mere adaptation to
surroundings, but a more and more perfect incarnation of truth.
Adaptation to surroundings is, from an ethical point of view, an
incidental blessing only of the power afforded by right conduct. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_244.md)

All facts of experience are revelations, but those facts which teach us
morality (man's conduct to his fellow-beings) embody truths of special
importance. They exercise a wholesome influence upon the development of
our souls, even though the primitive man was not able to fully
understand their why and wherefore. In the lack of a clear comprehension
of facts themselves, man's imagination clothes them in the garb of
mythological imagery. In our own days the great teachers of morality are
still regarded as the Indian regards the medicine-man, and

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

the sacraments of the Church are treated like the totems of savages.
Religion is now slowly passing out of the old stage of magic into the
higher stage of a direct comprehension of facts. Myth changes into
knowledge, and the allegory of the parable begins to be understood.

As astrology changed into astronomy, so the religion of miracles will
give way to the religion of science.

We often bear God spoken of as good, and he is sometimes represented as
goodness in general. But God is more than goodness. God is the objective
reality of existence regarded as the ultimate authority for conduct. God
is thus the standard of goodness; to call God good is an
anthropomorphism. His creatures are more or less good, according as they
are more or less faithful portraits of him, and as they obey his will.
God is neither good nor bad, neither moral nor immoral, he is unmoral;
yet, his nature and character is the ultimate criterion of goodness and
of morality. And God's will can be learned from his revelations, which
in the terms of science are called experiences, and which we formulate
with exactness in what is called "the laws of nature."

God is not existence itself; He is not, either singly or collectively,
the facts of the world; He is not the sum total of objects or
existences. God is the norm of existence, that factor which conditions
the cosmic order and is formulated by naturalists as laws of nature.
Being the norm of existence, God is, above all, that omnipresent feature
in the facts, in the objects of the world, in reality, which commands
obedience. God's will appears as that something in experience to which
we have to conform. In a word, God is the standard of morality and the
ultimate

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>

authority for conduct. This is nomotheism, but not pantheism, for it
recognises the distinction between God and the All or sum total of
existence. God is something distinct and definite, not an indifferent
omneity. This is monotheism, but not the old monotheism, for it no
longer looks upon God as one individual ego-being. Yet it preserves the
nucleus of the oldest conception of God, and accepts at the same time
all that is true in pantheism. <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_245.md)

God was always an idea of moral import. God was and will remain (so long
as the word is retained) the ultimate authority for conduct. Since the
order of the world in its most general features is of intrinsic
necessity, which means that under no conditions could it be imagined
otherwise, God is the *raison d'être* not only of the world as it
actually exists but of any possible world; and in this sense nomotheism
teaches that God is supernatural. Supernaturalism may be untenable as it
was understood by dogmatists, yet there is a truth in supernaturalism
which will remain true forever.

Those who see in the facts of nature only matter in motion will
naturally be surprised at the fact that a cosmos with living and morally
aspiring beings can develop out of it. A deeper insight into the
conditions of nature reveals to us that the world is a well regulated
cosmos, having its own definite and immutable laws, and these laws are
realities as much as material things. They are

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

not concrete entities, but they are real, nevertheless., and indeed of
greater importance than the existence of sense-perceptible objects. The
cosmos is not only an enormous mass of innumerable atoms, and molecules,
and masses of suns and stars, but its finer texture shows that down into
its most delicate details it is a wonderful systematic whole, full of
life and consistency, and possessing an outspoken and clearly
intelligible character, and the world-order which makes the world a
whole possesses objectivity, i. e., it is a reality independent of what
we think it to be. The world is not as we think it to be, but we must
think the world as it is, and our duty is to act accordingly.

These are the plain facts of science which even the man who has no idea
of science must heed. Only those creatures can in the long run of
evolution survive who act according to the truth. Thus, the truth became
embodied in moral rules, even before science could deduce or explain
them. Religion is a revelation in so far as it is an anticipation of
certain truths which were at the time of their invention still
uncomprehended. Religious ideas, accordingly, had to be symbols, and
could be communicated only in parables. Now, the more science
progresses, the better shall we learn to understand the meaning of these
parables.

God is in all things, but he is best revealed in man,--especially in the
morally aspiring man, and this is the meaning of the ideal of a God-man,
or Christ,--a Saviour whose teachings are the way, the truth, and the
life.

Every man's conception of God is a measure of his own stature. He
pictures God according to his comprehension,

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

and thus it is natural that every man has a different notion of God,
every one's God being characteristic of his mental and moral caliber. On
the lowest stages of civilisation devils and gods are almost
indistinguishable, but while they become properly differentiated in the
onward march of mankind we cannot fail to detect the parallelism between
God and Satan which is never lost. The god of savages is a bloodthirsty
chieftain; the god of sentimentalists is a good old papa; the god of the
superstitious is a magician and a trickster; the god of the slave is a
tyrannical master; the god of the egotist is an ego-world-soul; and the
gods of the wise, of the just, of the free, of the courageous are
wisdom, justice, freedom, and courage. The conception of evil in all
these phases will always be the contrast to the ideal embodiment of all
goodness.

Satan is at once a rebel and a tyrant. He proclaims independence but his
rule bodes oppression and slavery. He himself is represented in chains,
for the liberty of sin, which is licence, enthralls the mind. As Satan
is a captive of his own making, so all the beings that belong to him are
his prisoners. He is their torturer and destroyer.

A most drastic picture of Satan which is found in the missal of
Poitiers, <span id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_246.md) is described by Didron
as follows:

<span class="small">"He is chained to the mouth of hell as a dog to its
kennel, and yet wields his trident sceptre as the monarch of the place
which he guards. Cerberus and Pluto in one, he is yet a Cerberus of
Christian art, a demon more hideous and more filled with energy than
Pagan art has offered. . . . This image figures the various
aspects</span>

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span>

<span class="small">of infernal sin, by its many faces, having a face on
the breast as well as on the head, a face on each shoulder and a face at
each hip. How many more behind? With long ears like those of a hound,
thick short horns of a bull, his legs and arms are covered with scales,
and seem to issue from the mouths of the faces at his joints. He has a
lion's head with tusks, and hands like the claws of a bear. His body,
open at the waist, reveals a nest of serpents darting forth and hissing.
In this monster we find all the elements of a dragon, leviathan, lion,
fox, viper, bear, bull, and wild boar. It is a compound of each evil
quality in these animals, embodied in a human form." Didron,
*Iconography* II., p. 118</span>.

While Satan is the rebel who seeks liberty for himself and oppression of
others, God's kingdom signifies the establishment of right, which
insures the liberties of all. Satan promises liberty, but God gives
liberty. Schleiermacher, a learned and thoughtful man but of a weak
constitution, physically as well as spiritually, still bows down in
submissive awe before a God whom he conceived most probably after the
model of the Prussian government, and defines religion as the "feeling
of absolute dependence."

Poor Schleiermacher! What an abominable religion didst thou preach in
spite of thy philosophical caution which, in the eyes of zealous
believers, amounted to heresy!

It is worth while to criticise Schleiermacher's definition of religion,
because it found favor with many people, especially in liberal circles;
for it appealed to the free religious people as a definition which
omitted the name of God and retained the substance of religion. Would it
not be better to retain the name of God and purify its significance,
than to discard the word and retain the substance

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

and source of the old superstitions? But it is an old experience that
the Liberals are iconoclasts of external formalities and idolators of
reactionary thoughts. They retain the cause of obstruction, and discard
some of its indifferent results, in which it happens to find expression.
They cure the symptoms of the disease but are very zealous in extolling
its cause as the source of all that is good.

Schopenhauer in comment upon Schleiermacher's definition, said that if
religion be the feeling of absolute dependence, the most religious
animal would not be man, but the cur.

To the lovers of freedom the feeling of dependence is a curse, and Sasha
Schneider has well pictured it as a terrible monster whose prey are the
weak--those whose religion is absolute submissiveness.

Truly if we cannot have a religion which makes us free and independent,
let us discard religion! Religion must be in accord not only with
morality but also with philosophy; not only with justice, but also with
science; not only with order, but also with freedom.

Man is dependent upon innumerable conditions of his life; yet his
aspiration is not to be satisfied with the consciousness of his plight;
his aspiration is to become independent and to become more and more the
master of his destiny. If religion is the expression of that which
constitutes the humanity of man, Schleiermacher's definition is, wrong
and misleading, for religion is the very opposite. Religion is that
which makes man more of a man, which develops his faculties and allows
him more independence.

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

Monarchical Europe has generally characterised the Devil as the rebel in
the universe, and in a certain sense he is. But he represents revolution
only in its misguided attempts to gain liberty. Every rebellion which is
not in its own nature self-destructive, is an expression of the divine
spirit. Every dash for liberty is a righteous deed, and a revolutionary
movement that has the power and inherent good sense to be able to stay,
is of God.

Satan may be the representative of rebellion; God symbolises liberty.
Satan may promise independence by a call to arms against rules and
order; God gives independence by self-control and discretion. Satan is
sham freedom, in God we find true freedom. Satan is an indispensable
phase in the manifestation of God; he is the protest against God's
dispensation as a yoke and an imposition,

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

and thus revolting against the law prepares the way to the covenant of
love and spontaneous good-will.

We must only learn that independence cannot be gained by a rebellion
against the constitution of the universe, or by inverting the laws of
life and evolution, but by comprehending them and adapting ourselves to
the world in which we live. By a recognition of the truth, which must be
acquired by painstaking investigation and by accepting the truth as our

rises to the height of self-determination, of dominion over the forces
of nature, of freedom. It is the truth that makes us free.

So long as the truth is something foreign to us, we speak of obedience
to the truth; but when we have learned to identify ourselves with truth,
the moral ought ceases to be a tyrannical power above us, and we feel
ourselves as its representatives; it changes into aspirations in us.
True religion is love of truth, and being

truth, which is liberty, freedom, independence.

There is a similarity between our conceptions of good and evil which
cannot be accidental, for it is natural that all our thoughts should
possess a certain family likeness. Your idea of the Devil is your best
interpretation of your idea of God. It will be interesting to compare
one of the most famous representations of God, holding the universe in

This similarity can be proved from history.

The Trinity conception of Satan is as old as the Trinity conception of
God. As we have Trinities among the Pagan deities, for instance among
the Greeks, the three-headed Hecuba; so we have three-headed monsters as
for instance, the three-headed Cerberus; and in the history of Christian
art a similar parallelism obtains between God-representations arid Devil
-representations. The idea of representing the divine trinity as a
person having three faces may have originated in a modification of the
two-headed Janus.

Professor Kraus says concerning the trinitarian demons of Christianity:

<span class="small">"The diabolical dragon is described as a
three-headed monster (probably in recollection of Cerberus) in the
Apocryphal Gospel of</span>

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

<span class="small">Nicodemus, and in the *Good Friday Sermon* of
Eusebius of Alexandria, who addresses the Devil 'Three-headed Beelzebul'
(τρικέφαλε βεελζεβούλ). The idea of the Demon as a serpent with the head
of a woman appears not earlier than the Middle Ages, in Bede, from whom
it is quoted by Vincent de Beauvais."</span>

Dante describes the three-faced Satan in these lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Oh, what a sight!  
How passing strange it seemed when I did spy  
*Upon his head three faces*: one in front  
Of hue vermilion, the other two with this  
Midway each shoulder joined and at the crest;  
The right 'twixt wan and yellow seemed; the left  
To look on, such as come from whence old Nile  
Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth  
Two mighty wings, enormous as became  
A bird so vast. No plumes had they,  
But were in texture like a bat, and these  
He flapped in the air, that from him issued still  
Three winds wherewith Cocytus to its depth  
Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears  
Adown three chins distilled with bloody foam.  
At every mouth his teeth a sinner champed,  
Bruised as with ponderous engine; so that three  
Were in this guise tormented." (*Hell*. Canto xxxiv.)</span>

</div>

As according to Christian doctrine God is actualised in the God-man, so
Satan in his turn is represented as the Antichrist and is pictured as a
human caricature full of ugliness and wickedness. Professor Kraus
continues:

<span class="small">"Simultaneously with the conception of the Devil as
a dragon are found in the Acts of the Martyrs notions of him as an awful
negro (a Moor or Ethiopian). The same views are found in Augustine,
Gregory the Great, and the Apocryphal Acts of St. Bartholomew. In the
latter, the idea is so far developed as to represent</span>

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

<span class="small">the Devil as the archetype of deformity: he becomes
a negro with a dog's snout, covered with hair down to his toes, with
glowing</span>

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

<span class="small">the Evil One, which perhaps is based on job xli. 9
et seq., contains all the elements of the grotesque conception of the
Middle Ages. They are found also in the *Vita S. Antonii* where also the
horns of the Devil are mentioned."</span>

Compare for instance Milton's Satan with Goethe's Mephistopheles! The
one heroic like the English nation,

<span id="img_48000"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![THE GOOD LORD AND
THE DEVIL.&lt;br&gt; (In Goethe's Faust, by Franz
Simm.)](tn/generic.jpg)

(In Goethe's Faust, by Franz Simm.)  
</span>

a Protestant, a rebel, a dissenter, a subjectivist (see page 351 ff.),
the other a sage, a scholar, a philosopher, like a German poet. Goethe's
Mephistopheles is not as grand as Milton's Satan, but he is in his way
not less interesting, for he is more ingenious, more learned, more

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

poetical. He is a philosophical principle, being the spirit of
criticism; and as such he plays an important part in the economy of
nature.

Mephistopheles characterises himself in these words:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">I am the spirit that denies!  
And justly so: For all things from the void  
Called forth, deserve to be destroyed.  
T'were better, then, were nought created.  
Thus, all which you as sin have rated,--  
Destruction,--aught with evil blent,--  
That is my proper element."</span>

</div>

And what a sympathy exists between Mephistopheles, the spirit of
criticism and the dignified author of the Universe. The Lord says in the
Prelude to Faust:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In self-indulgence man finds soon his level  
He seeks repose and ease; and stops to grow.  
Gladly on him the comrade I'll bestow  
Who will provoke and must create as Devil."</span>

</div>

As God, now and then, needs the Devil, so the Devil is anxious from time
to time to pay his respects to the good Lord. After the heaven is closed
Mephistopheles remains alone on the stage and says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"At times the Ancient Gent I like to see,  
Keep on good terms with him and am most civil."</span>

</div>

Hobbling away, he stops before leaving the stage and turning to the
audience adds:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis truly fine of such a grand grandee  
So humanly to gossip with the Devil."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_482">p. 482</span>

*Conclusion*.

Evil personified appears at first sight repulsive. But the more we study
the personality of the Devil, the more fascinating it becomes. In the
beginning of existence the Evil One is the embodiment of everything
unpleasant, then of everything bad, evil, and immoral. He is hatred,
destruction, and annihilation incarnate, and as such he is the adversary
of existence, of the Creator, of God. The Devil is the rebel of the
cosmos, the independent in the empire of a tyrant, the opposition to
uniformity, the dissonance in universal harmony, the exception to the
rule, the particular in the universal, the unforeseen chance that breaks
the law; he is the individualising tendency, the craving for
originality, which bodily upsets the ordinances of God that enforce a
definite kind of conduct; he overturns the monotony that would permeate
the cosmic spheres if every atom in unconscious righteousness and with
pious obedience slavishly followed a generally prescribed course.

The ingenuous question, "Why does not God kill the Devil?" is comical
enough, because we feel instinctively that it is impossible. I know of a
good old lady who prayed daily with great fervor and piety that God
might have mercy on the Devil and save him. Think of it closely, and
this attitude is touching! How many great theologians have seriously
discussed the problem whether the Devil could be saved. Like that good
old lady, they were so engrossed in the literal belief of their
mythology that they did not see that the problem implied a

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

contra-diction. For God and Devil are relative terms, and God would
cease to be God if there were no Devil.

The universe is such that the evolution of a higher life is possible
only through great strain. The evolution of the warm glow of a soul out
of the cold clay of the earth, of moral aspirations out of the fierce
hatred that animates the struggle for existence, of intelligence,
thought and foresight out of the brute indifference of that unthinking
something which *we call* matter in motion, is due to extraordinary
exertions; it is the product of work performed by the expenditure of
enormous energy, and constant efforts are required merely to preserve
the treasures already won. Difficulties to be overcome are called in the
terminology of mechanics "the power of resistance," and this power of
resistance is, closely considered, an essential and even a beneficial
factor in the constitution of the universe.

If there were no power of resistance, if no efforts were needed to reach
any end desired, if the world were pleasure and goodness throughout, we
should have no evolution, no progress, no ideals; for all spheres of
existence would float in one universal ocean of bliss, and all things
would be intoxicated with heavenly delight.

Pain produces the want of something better, and deficiencies arouse the
desire for improvement. If the feeling substance of moners had all their
wants satisfied without further exertion, man would never have risen out
of the bythos of amæboid existence, and if the man of to-day lived in a
Schlaraffia, he would not trouble about new inventions, progress, or any
amelioration; he would simply live on in unthinking enjoyment. There
would

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

be no need of making any effort, no need of struggling against evils, no
need of virtue, no need of working out our salvation. There would be no
badness, but there would be no goodness, either. All existence would be
soaked with moral indifference.

Good is good only because there is evil, and God is God because there is
a Devil.

As evil is not a mere negation, so the figure of Satan in religion is
not an idle fancy. Goethe says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Ich kann mich nicht bereden lassen,  
Macht mir den Teufel nur nicht klein:  
Ein Kerl, den alle Menschen hassen,  
Der muss was sein!"

\["You have the Devil underrated.  
I cannot yet persuaded be!  
A fellow who is all-behated,  
Must something be."\]

</div>

Now, let us look at the mythical figure of Satan as represented in
theology, folklore, and poetry. Is he not really a most interesting man?
Indeed, in spite of being a representative of all kinds of crimes, be
possesses many redeeming features so as to be great and noble. According
to the account in the second chapter of Genesis, Satan is the father of
science, for he induced Eve to make Adam taste of the fruit of
knowledge, and the Ophites, a gnostic sect, worshipped the serpent for
that reason. Satan produces the unrest in society, which, in spite of
many inconveniences, makes the world move onward an(l forward; he is the
patron of progress, investigation, and invention. Giordano Bruno,
Galileo, and other men of science were regarded as his offspring and
persecuted on

his account by the Church. And when we glance over the records of the
Devil-contracts, we learn to have respect for the old gentleman.
Milton's Satan is a grand character, a noble-souled rebel, who would
rather undergo an eternity of torture than suffer humiliation.

Consider but the fact that, taking the statement of his adversaries
alone, the Devil is the most trustworthy person in existence. He has
been cheated by innumerable sinners, saints, angels, and (according to
various old Church legends) even by the good Lord himself; and yet he
has never been found wanting in the literal and punctilious fulfilment
of all his promises; and all the bad experiences he has had in the
course of millenniums have not in the least lowered his character. His
mere word is honored as the holiest oath, or as the best signature
verified with seals and legal witnesses. The instances are rare in which
it is known that persons with whom he has had business transactions have
requested him to sign a contract, to give a pledge, or to show any proof
that he would honestly abide by his word; his honesty was never doubted
by anybody. And mind you, it is not the Devil who boasts of his
integrity, but this is the conclusion at which we arrive from the
evidences adduced by his enemies.

Our sympathy for this martyr of honest conduct, the

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

dupe of God and man, grows when we consider our own nature and relation
to his Satanic majesty. With our hands upon our hearts, must we not
confess that every one of us, in spite of man's boastful claim of a
likeness to God, has some trait or other that makes him kin to the
Devil? I do not mean here to make reference to actual sin or grievous
transgressions, but to things of which we scarcely think of repenting.
Did we never in an hour of humor laugh at our neighbor? Did we never
joke at the cost of somebody else? Did we never bulldoze, tease, or
tantalise our very best friends? Did we never enjoy the awkward
situation in which some poor innocent had been caught? And why should we
not? If we took away from life its satire, jokes, and other
"deviltries," it would lose part of its most fragrant zest, and if we
constructed a man consisting of virtues only, would not that fellow be
the most unbearable bore in the world, wearisome beyond description? For
it is a sprinkling of petty vices that makes even a great man human. A
mere ethical machine would neither be attractive nor arouse our
sympathies.

The Devil is the father of all misunderstood geniuses. It is he who
induces us to try new paths; he begets originality of thought and deed.
He tempts us to venture out boldly into unknown seas for the discovery
of new ways to the wealth of distant Indias. He makes us dream of and
hope for more prosperity and greater happiness. He is the spirit of
discontent that embitters our hearts, but in the end often leads to a
better arrangement of affairs. In truth, he is a very useful servant of
the Almighty, and all the heinous features of his character

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

disappear when we consider the fact that he is necessary in the economy
of nature as a wholesome stimulant to action and as the power of
resistance that evokes the noblest efforts of living beings.

God, being the All in All, regarded as the ultimate authority for
conduct, is neither evil itself nor goodness itself; but, nevertheless,
he is in the good, and he is in the evil. He encompasses good and evil.
God is in the growth and in the decay; he reveals himself in life, and
he reveals himself in death. He will be found in the storm, he will be
found in the calm. He lives in good aspirations and in the bliss resting
upon moral endeavors; but he lives also in the visitations that follow
evil actions. It is his voice that speaks in the guilty conscience, and
he, too, is in the curse of sin, and in this sense he is present even in
the evil itself. Even evil, temptation, and sin elicit the good: they
teach man. He who has eyes to see, ears to hear, and a mind to perceive,
will read a lesson out of the very existence of evil, a lesson which, in
spite of the terrors it inspires, is certainly not less impressive, nor
less divine, than the sublimity of a holy life; and thus it becomes
apparent that the existence of Satan is part and parcel of the divine
dispensation. Indeed we must grant that the Devil is the most
indispensable and faithful helpmate of God. To speak mystically, even
the existence of the Devil is filled with the presence of God.

glory issued from his countenance taking shape in the figure of

into the system of the goddess who then went forth and slew the
buffalo-shaped monster Mahisha. Another account of the same myth is
contained in the *Vâmana Purâna*. For details see Hindu mythologies
