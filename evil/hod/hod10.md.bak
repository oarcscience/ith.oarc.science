# BUDDHISM.

BUDDHISM is a religious revolution against the evils that are dominant
in Brahmanism. Gautama Shakyamuni, who claimed to be the Enlightened
One, the Buddha, rejected bloody sacrifices, the authority of the Vedas,
trust in rituals and the caste system, and taught a religion of moral
endeavor which was to be obtained by enlightenment, or the bodhi. He
recognised the existence of evil and sought salvation in the radical
abolition of all selfishness through the extension of an
all-comprehensive love toward all creatures.

The many-sidedness of Buddhism is well illustrated in the Buddhistic
conception of evil and of a final escape from evil, which is taught to
the thinker in the shape of a philosophy, and to the uneducated masses
in the garb of a poetical myth, affording the artist a good opportunity
for representing deep thoughts in allegorical form.

*Mara, the Evil One*.

Evil is personified in Mara, the Buddhist Devil, who represents
temptation, sin, and death. He is identified with Namuche, one of the
wicked demons in Indian mythology

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

with whom Indra struggles. Namuche is the mischievous spirit who
prevents rain and produces drought. The name Namuche means "not letting
go the waters." However, Indra, the god of thunder-storms, forces him to
surrender the fertilising liquids and restores the life-bringing element
to the earth.

Mara is also called Papiyan <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) the
Wicked One or the Evil One, the Murderer, the Tempter. In addition he is
said to be Varsavarti, <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md) meaning "he
who fulfils desires." Varsavarti, indeed, is one of his favorite names.
In his capacity as Varsavarti, Mara personifies the fulfilment of desire
or the triple thirst, <span id="fr_49"></span>[3](#fn_49.md) viz., the
thirst for existence, the thirst for pleasure, the thirst for power. He
is the king of the Heaven of sensual delight.

There is a deep truth in this conception of Mara as Varsavarti. It means
that the selfishness of man is Satan and the actual satisfaction of
selfishness is Hell.

This reminds us of one of Leander's *Märchen*, in which we are told that
once a man died and awoke in the other world. There St. Peter appeared
before him and asked him what he wanted. He then ordered breakfast, the
daily papers, and all the comforts he was accustomed to in life, and
this kind of life lasted for many centuries until he got sick of it and
began to swear at St. Peter and to complain of how monotonous it was in
Heaven, whereupon St. Peter informed him that he was in Hell,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

for hell is where everybody has his own sweet will, and heaven is where
everybody follows God's will alone. Similarly, according to the Buddhist
conception, the heaven of sensual delight is hell, the habitation of the
Evil One.

</span>

In the Dhammapada, Mara is not so much a person as a personification.
The allegorical nature of the Evil One is plainly felt in every passage
in which Mara's name occurs. We read, for instance:

<span class="small">"He who lives looking for pleasures only, his senses
uncontrolled,</span>

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="small">immoderate in his food, idle and weak, him Mara will
certainly overthrow as the wind throws down a feeble tree."</span>

Buddhism in its original and orthodox purity knows nothing of devils
except Mara, representing the egotistical pleasures, sensuality, sin,
and death; but Buddhist

<span id="img_10700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![THE DEMON OF

THE DEMON OF THUNDER. A Japanese temple statue.  
</span>

mythology from the ancient Jatakas down to the most modern folklore of
China and Japan has peopled the universe with evil spirits of all kinds,
such as the demons of thunder and lightning, to personify the various
ills of life and the dangers that lurk everywhere in nature.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

While the evil consequences of sin are depicted in the tortures of Hell
which are similar to the Christian belief, the final escape from evil is
expressed in the belief that all good Buddhists will be reborn in the
Western Paradise.

*Mara, the Enemy of Buddha*.

In the life of Buddha, Mara plays an important part. He is that
principle which forms an obstacle to the attainment of Buddhahood.
Having told how, in the night of the great renunciation, the deity of
the door swung the gate open to let the future Buddha out, the Jataka
continues:

<span class="small">"At that moment Mara came there with the intention
of stopping the Bodisat; and standing in the air, he exclaimed, 'Depart
not, O my lord! in seven days from now the wheel of empire will appear,
and will make you sovereign over the four continents and the two
thousand adjacent isles. Stop, O my lord!"</span>

The prince refused to listen to Mara's wily insinuation.

When Buddha, in his search for enlightenment, had tried for seven years
to find the right path in asceticism and self-mortification, his health
began to give way and he was shrunken like a withered branch. At this
moment Mara drew near and suggested to him the thought of giving up his
search for enlightenment. We read in the Padhana Sutta: <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

<span class="small">"Came Namuche speaking words full of compassion:
'Thou art lean, ill-favored, death is in thy neighborhood. Living life,
O thou Venerable One, is better! Living, thou wilt be able to do good
works. Difficult is the way of exertion, difficult to pass, difficult to
enter upon.'</span>

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

"To Mara, thus speaking, Bhagavat said: 'O thou friend of the indolent,
thou wicked one, for what purpose hast thou come here? Even the least
good work is of no use to me, and what good works are required ought
Mara to tell? I have faith and power; and understanding is found in me.
While thus exerting myself, why do you ask me to live? While the flesh
is wasting away the mind grows more tranquil, and my attention,
understanding, and meditation becomes more steadfast. Living thus, my
mind does not look for sensual pleasures. Behold a being's purity!

"Lust thy first army is called; discontent thy second; thy third is
called hunger and thirst; thy fourth desire; thy fifth is called sloth
and drowsiness; thy sixth cowardice; thy seventh doubt; thy eighth
hypocrisy and stupor, gain, fame, honor, and what celebrity is falsely
obtained by him who exalts himself and despises others. This, O Namuche,
is thine, the Black One's fighting army. None but a hero conquers it,
and whoever conquers it obtains joy. Woe upon life in this world! Death
in battle is better for me than that I should live defeated.

"Seeing on all sides an army arrayed and Mara on his elephant, I am
going out to do battle that he may not drive me from my place. This army
of thine, which the world of men and gods cannot conquer, I will crush
with understanding, as one crushes an unbaked earthen pot with a stone.

"Having made my thoughts subject to me and my attention firm, I shall
wander about from kingdom to kingdom training disciples. They will be
zealous and energetic, obedient to the discipline of one free from lust,
and they will go to the place where there is no mourning.

"And Mara said: 'For seven years I followed Bhagavat, step by step, but
found no fault in the Perfectly Enlightened and Thoughtful One.'"

When Buddha went to the Bo-tree Mara, the Evil One, proposed to shake
his resolution, either through the allurements of his daughters or by
force. "He sounded

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

the war cry and drew out for battle." The earth quaked, when Mara,
mounted on his elephant, approached the Buddha. The gods, among them
Sakka, the king of the gods, and Brahma, tried to stay Mara's army, but
none of them was able to stand his ground, and each fled straight before
him. Buddha said:

<span class="small">"'Here is this multitude exerting all their strength
and power against me alone. My mother and father are not here, nor a
brother, nor any other relative. But I have these Ten Perfections, like
old retainers long cherished at my board. It therefore behooves me to
make the Ten Perfections my shield and my sword, and to strike a blow
with them that shall destroy this strong array.' And he remained sitting
and reflected on the Ten Perfections."--*Buddhism in Translations*. By
H. C. Warren, pp. 77-78.</span>

Mara caused a whirlwind to blow, but in vain; he caused a rain-storm to
come in order to drown the Buddha, but not a drop wetted his robes; he
caused a shower of rocks to come down, but the rocks changed into
bouquets; he caused a shower of weapons--swords, spears, and arrows--to
rush against him, but they became celestial flowers; he caused a shower
of live coals to come down from the sky, but they, too, fell down
harmless. In the same way hot ashes, a shower of sand, and a shower of
mud were transmuted into celestial ointments. At last he caused a
darkness, but the darkness disappeared before Buddha, as the night
vanishes before the sun. Mara shouted: "Siddhattha, arise from the seat.
It does not belong to you. It belongs to me." Buddha replied: "Mara, you
have not fulfilled the ten perfections. This seat does not belong to
you, but to me, who have fulfilled the ten perfections." Mara denied

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Buddha's assertion and called upon his army as witnesses, while Buddha
declared: "I have no animate witnesses present;" but, stretching out his
right hand towards the mighty earth, he said: "Will you bear me
witness?" And the mighty earth thundered: "I bear you witness." And
Mara's elephant fell upon its knees, and all the followers of Mara fled
away in all directions. When the hosts of the gods saw the army of Mara
flee, they cried out: "Mara is defeated! Prince Siddhattha has
conquered! Let us celebrate the victory!"

When Buddha had attained enlightenment, Mara tempted him once more,
saying:

<span class="small">"Pass away now, Lord, from existence! Let the
Blessed One now die! Now is the time for the Blessed One to pass
away!"</span>

Buddha made reply as follows:

"I shall not die, O Evil One! until not only the brethren and sisters of
the order, but also the lay-disciples of either sex shall have become
true hearers, wise and well trained, ready and learned, versed in the
Scriptures, fulfilling all the greater and the lesser duties, correct in
life, walking according to the precepts,--until they, having thus
themselves learned the doctrine, shall be able to tell others of it,
preach it, make it known, establish it, open it, minutely explain it and
make it clear,--until they, when others start vain doctrines, shall be
able by the truth to vanquish and refute it, and so to spread the
wonder-working truth abroad!

"I shall not die until this pure religion of mine shall have become
successful, prosperous, wide-spread, and popular in all its full extent,
until, in a word, it shall have been well proclaimed among men!"

When, shortly before Buddha's death, Mara repeated his words as quoted
above, "Pass away now, Lord, from existence," Buddha answered:

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="small">"Make thyself happy; the final extinction of the
Tathagata shall take place before long."</span>

*Mara in Buddhist Art*.

In the various sculptures representing scenes of Buddha's life there is
a figure holding in his hand a kind of double club or vajra--i. e.,
thunderbolt, as it is usually called. Since the expression of this man
with the thunderbolt decidedly shows malevolence, the interpretation
naturally suggested itself that he must be one of Buddha's disciples who
was antagonistic to his teachings. The common explanation of this
figure, accordingly, designated him as Devadatta, the Buddhistic Judas
Iscariot, who endeavored to found a sect of his own, and who according
to Buddhistic legends is represented as an intriguer bent on the murder
of Buddha. The various representations of this figure, however, are not
altogether those of a disciple who tries to outdo Buddha in sternness
and severity of discipline, but frequently bear the character of a Greek
faun, and resemble, rather, Silenus, the foster-father of Bacchus,
representing all kinds of excesses in carousing and other pleasures.
Moreover, the same figure with the thunderbolt appears in
representations of Buddha's entering Nirvana, at a time when Devadatta
had been long dead. Alfred Grünwedel, for these reasons, proposes to
abandon the traditional interpretation of the thunderbolt-bearer as
Devadatta, and it appears that he has found the right interpretation
when he says: <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)

<span class="small">"This figure which accompanies Buddha from the
moment he leaves his father's house until he enters Nirvana, and who
waylays</span>

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

him in the hope of awakening in him a thought of lust or hatred or envy,
who follows him like a shadow, can be no one but Mara Papiyan, the
Wicked One, the demon of passion. The thunderbolt in Mara's hand is
nothing but the old attribute of all Indian gods. In his capacity as the
god of pleasure, Mara is especially entitled to this attribute of the
Hindu gods. As Vasavatti he reigns in the highest domain of the pleasure
heaven, surrounded by dancing girls and musicians."

<span id="img_11400"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![BUDDHA TEMPTED BY

</span>

It seems probable that the contrast in which Mara or Varsavarti stands
to the Buddha began by and by to be misunderstood. For the
thunderbolt-bearer Vajrapani is gradually changed into a regular
attendant of Buddha, and the Vajra, or thunderbolt, is now interpreted
as an attribute of Buddha himself. Thus it happened that among the
northern Buddhists the Vaira became the indispensable

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

attribute of the lamas. It is called Dorje in Tibet and Ojir in
Mongolia.

\*      <sup>\*</sup>      \*

The attack of Mara upon Buddha under the bo-tree is a favorite subject
of Buddhist artists, who gladly avail themselves of this opportunity to
show their ingenuity in devising all kinds of beautiful and hideous
shapes. Beautiful women represent the temptations of the daughters of
Mara, and the hideous monsters describe the terrors of Mara's army.

In Buddhistic mythology Mara, the Evil One, is, in harmony with the
spirit of Buddha's teachings, represented as the Prince of the World. It
is Mara who holds the wheel of life and death (*Chavachakra*, i. e.,
wheel of becoming) in his hands, for all living beings reside in the
domain of death. The hand of death is upon every one who is born. He is
the ruler in the domains of the *nidanas*, the twelve links of the chain
of causation, or dependent origination.

*The Twelve Nidanas*.

The twelve nidanas are a very old doctrine, which possibly goes back to
Buddha himself, and may contain elements that are older. While the
general meaning of the chain of causation is clearly indicated by the
first and last links, which imply that ignorance, not-knowing, or
infatuation is at the bottom of all evil, there are great difficulties
in the interpretation of the details, and Mr. Warren thinks that it is a
combination of two chains of causation representing similar thoughts. He
says:

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="small">"The Buddhist Sacred Books seem to claim Dependent
Origination as the peculiar discovery of the Buddha, and I suppose they
would have us understand that he invented the whole formula from
beginning to end. But it is to be observed that the formula repeats
itself, that the human being is brought into existence twice--the first
time under the name of consciousness, and name and form and by means of
ignorance and karma, the second time in birth and by means of desire
(with its four branches called attachments) and karma again, this time
called existence. <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) Therefore, though
Buddhaghosa is at great pains to explain this repetition as purposely
intended for practical ends, yet one is much inclined to surmise that
the full formula in its present shape is a piece of patchwork put
together of two or more that were current in the Buddha's time and by
him--perhaps expanded, perhaps contracted, but at any rate made into
one. If the Buddha added to the formula of Dependent Origination, it
would appear that the addition consisted in the first two propositions.
For ignorance, of course, is the opposite of wisdom, and wisdom is the
method for getting rid of ignorance."--*Buddhism in Translations*, p.
115</span>.

Whatever may have been the original wording, the traditional formula of
the causation of evil has been, without change, faithfully preserved in
the triumphal progress of Buddhism from India to Japan. One of the
oldest passages in which the twelve nidanas are enumerated is found in
the *Questions of King Milinda*, p. 79, where we read:

<span class="small">"By reason of ignorance came the Confections, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) by reason of the Confections
consciousness, by reason of consciousness name-and-form, by reason of
name-and-form the six organs of sense, by reason of them contact, by
reason of contact sensation, by reason</span>

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="small">of sensation thirst, by reason of thirst craving, by
reason of craving becoming, by reason of becoming birth, by reason of
birth old age and death, grief, lamentation, sorrow, pain, and despair.
Thus is it that the ultimate point in the past of all this time is not
apparent."--Translated by T. W. Rhys Davids in *Sacred Books of the
East*, Vol. XXXV.</span>

The Samyutta Nikaya enumerates as the second nidana "karma," i. e.,
action. The passage reads:

"On ignorance depends karma;

"On karma depends consciousness

"On consciousness depend name and form;

"On name and form depend the six organs of sense;

"On the six organs of sense depends contact

"On contact depends sensation

"On sensation depends desire;

"On desire depends attachment;

"On attachment depends existence;

"On existence depends birth;

"On birth depend old age and death, sorrow, lamentation. misery, grief,
and despair. Thus does this entire aggregation of misery arise.

"But on the complete fading out and cessation of ignorance ceases karma;

"On the cessation of karma ceases consciousness On the cessation of
consciousness ceases name and form;

"On the cessation of name and form cease the six organs of sense;

"On the cessation of the six organs of sense ceases contact; On the
cessation of contact ceases sensation

"On the cessation of sensation ceases desire;

"On the cessation of desire ceases attachment

"On the cessation of attachment ceases existence

"On the cessation of existence ceases birth;

"On the cessation of birth cease old age and death, sorrow,

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="small">lamentation, misery, grief, and despair. Thus does
this entire aggregation of misery cease."--*Buddhism in Translations*,
Warren, p. 166.</span>

The Pali terms are: (1) *avijja* (ignorance), (2) *sankhara* (organised
formation) or *kamma* (Karma), (3) *vinnyana* (sentiency), (4)
*nama-rupa* (name and form, i. e., individuality), (5) *salayatana* (the
six fields, i. e., the five senses and mind), (6) *phasso* (contact),
(7) *vedana* (sensation), (8) *tanha* (thirst), (9) *upadana* (craving),
(10) *bhava* (growth), (11) *jati* (birth), (12) *jaramarana*, etc. (old
age, death, sorrow, etc.).

It seems that we have three chains of causation combined into one. One
chain explains that Karma, i. e., deed or activity, produces first
*vinnyana* (sentiency), and then *nama-rupa* (name and form, or
personality); the other begins with sensation, as known in the six
senses or *salayatana*, which by contact (*phasso*) produces first
consciousness (*vedana*) and then thirst (*tanha*). The third group,
which may be the peculiarly Buddhistic addition to the two older
formulas, is founded in the first, or first and second, and the four
concluding links of the traditional chain, stating that ignorance
(*avijja*) produces blindly in its random work organisations
(*sankharas*). These sankharas or elementary organisms are possessed of
craving (*upadana*), which leads to conception (*bhava*) and birth
(*jati*), thus producing old age, death, sorrow, and misery of any kind.

*The Wheel of Life*.

Life in its eternal rotation is represented in Buddhist mythology as a
wheel that is held in the clutches of the Evil One.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Judging from a communication of Caroline A. Foley (in the *Journal of
the Royal Asiatic Society*, 1894, p. 389), the allegory of the
world-wheel, the wheel of life,

<span id="img_11900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![AN INDIAN WHEEL OF

</span>

must be much older than is commonly thought, for it is mentioned already
in the *Divyavadana*, pp. 299-300.

Caroline Foley says:

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="small">"There it is related how Buddha instructed Ananda to
make a wheel (cakram karayitavyam) for the purpose of illustrating what
another disciple, Maudgalyayana, saw when he visited other spheres,
which it seems he was in the habit of doing. The wheel was to have five
spokes (*pancagandakam*), between which were to be depicted the hells,
animals, pretas, gods, and men. In the middle a dove, a serpent, and a
hog, were to symbolise lust, hatred, and ignorance. All round the tire
was to go the twelve-fold circle of causation (*pratityasamutpado*) in
the regular and in the inverse order. Beings were to be represented 'as
being born in a supernatural way (*aupapadukah*), as by the machinery of
a waterwheel, falling from one state and being produced in another.' The
wheel was made and placed in the 'grand entrance gateway'
(*dvarakoshtake*), and a bhikshu appointed to interpret it."</span>

Samsara, or the circuit of life, the eternal round of birth, death, and
rebirth, as summarily expressed in the doctrine of the twelve nidanas or
twelve-linked chain of causation, is painted around the tire of the
wheel.

How carefully the Buddhistic conception of Mara, as the Prince of the
world, holding in his clutches the wheel of life, has been preserved, we
can learn from a comparison of an old fresco in the deserted caves of
Ajanta, Central India, <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) with Tibetan
and Japanese pictures of the same subject. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) All of them show in the centre the three
causes of selfhood, viz., hatred, spite, and sloth, symbolised in a
serpent, a cock, and a pig. They are also called the three fires, or the
three roots of evil, which are *raga* (passion), *doso* (sin), *moho*
(infatuation).

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

The Hindu picture exhibits six divisions,--the realm of gods, the realm
of men, the realm of nagas (or snakes), <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md)

<span id="img_12100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![A TIBETAN WHEEL OF

</span>

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

the realm of paradise, the realm of ghosts, and the realm of hell. The
Tibetan picture shows the same domains, only less distinctly separated,
while the Japanese picture shows only five divisions. In order to show
the omnipresence of the Buddha as the principle that sustains all life,
the Japanese picture shows a Buddha statue in the hub, while in the
Hindu wheel every division contains a Buddha figure. This Buddha in the
world is the Buddha of transformations, *Nirmana-Kaya*, representing the
tendency of life toward enlightenment. Outside of the wheel two other
Buddha figures appear. At the right-hand corner there is Buddha, the
teacher, in the attitude of expounding the good law of righteousness. It
is the *Dharma-Kaya*, the Buddha embodied in the dharma, i. e. the law,
religion, or truth. In the left-hand corner there is Buddha in the state
of rest, represented as *Sambhoga-Kaya*, the Buddha who has entered into
Nirvana and attained the highest bliss.

The twelve nidanas are an essential element in the Buddhist wheel of
life, and are commonly represented by twelve little pictures either on
the tire or surrounding the tire.

On the Japanese wheel, which exhibits the nidanas more clearly than the
older wheels, the series begins at the bottom, rising to the left-hand
side and turning down again on the right-hand side.

The first nidana (in Pali *Avijja*), ignorance, is pictured as a
passionate man of brutish appearance.

The second nidana (in Pali *Sankhara*, Sanskrit *Samskara*), which is
commonly but badly translated in English by "confection," represents the
ultimate constitutions

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

of life or primary forms of organisation, meaning a disposition of
structures that possess the tendency to repeat the function once
performed. It is represented as a potter's wheel on which vessels are
manufactured. The word should not be confused with *samsara*, which is

<span id="img_12300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![A JAPANESE WHEEL
OF LIFE. (Reproduced from Bastian.)](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/12300.jpg.md)  
A JAPANESE WHEEL OF LIFE. (Reproduced from Bastian.)  
</span>

the whole wheel of life, or the eternal round of transmigration.

The third nidana is vinnyana, or awareness, being the sentiency that
originates by the repetition of function in the dispositions or
organised structures previously formed. It is animal sense-perception,
represented as a monkey.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

The fourth nidana is "nama-rupa," i. e., name and form, which expression
denotes what we call personality, the name of a person and his personal
appearance. It is represented by a pilot steering a boat.

The fifth nidana is called the six fields or "shadayatana," which are
what we call the five senses and mind, or thinking, which is considered
by Buddhists as a sixth sense. It is pictured as a human organism.

The sixth nidana is "phasso" or "sparsa," i. e., the contact of the six
fields, with their objects, represented as a lover's embrace.

Rising from a contact of the six fields with their objects, the seventh
nidana is produced as "vedana," i. e., sensation or sentiment,
illustrated by a sighing lover. If the sixth nidana is enacted in the
garden scene of Goethe's "Faust," the seventh is characterised by
Margaret's song, "My peace is gone, my heart is sore." (Scene xv.)

From sentiment, as the eighth nidana, "tanha," i. e., thirst or desire,
rises. The picture exhibits the flirtation of two separated lovers.

The ninth nidana is "upadana," i. e., the clinging to existence. The
picture shows us the lover following the footsteps of his love.

The tenth nidana is "bhava" (bridal embrace), or existence in its
continuation, finding its artistic expression in the union of the
lovers, who, seated on the back of an elephant, are celebrating their
marriage feast.

The eleventh nidana is birth, "jati," in the picture represented as a
woman in her throes.

The remaining groups represent the twelfth nidana

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

and its various sufferings, which consist of old age, disease, death,
lamentation, complaints, punishments, and all kinds of tribulations.

The twelve pictures on the Hindu wheel are less distinct, but there is
no question about their meaning being exactly the same. Beginning at the
top on the right-hand side, we find first an angry man, representing
ignorance, then a figure which might be a potter forming vessels of clay
on the potter's wheel, representing the formation of dispositions or
primary soul-forms. The third picture represents a monkey climbing a
tree, symbolising animal perception or the individuality of organisms.
The fourth- picture shows a ship on a stream, representing the origin of
mind under the allegory of a pilot. The fifth picture seems to be a
house built upon five foundation stones, which we interpret as the five
senses, the superstructure representing mind, the sixth sense. Then
follows the sixth picture, a woman, kindling desire of contact. The
seventh represents sentiment in the shape of two sighing lovers. The
eighth picture represents thirst or desire as two separated lovers. The
ninth picture, reminding us of Adam and Eve in Paradise, is a man
plucking flowers or fruits from a tree; it illustrates the tasting of
the apple of sexual love. The tenth picture illustrates pregnancy, the
eleventh birth, and the twelfth is the demon of death carrying away the
white body of a dead man.

The wheel of life as now frequently pictured in Buddhist temples of
Japan can, in its wanderings from India through Tibet and China, be
traced back to a remote antiquity,

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

for we know positively that this conception of the Evil One in his
relation to the world, existed about two thousand years ago, in the days
when Buddhism still flourished in India, but it is not improbable that
it must be dated back to a time preceding Buddha. We may fairly assume
that when Buddha lived, such or similar representations of the
significance of evil in life existed and that he utilised the
traditional picture for the purposes of spreading his own religion,
adding thereto his own interpretation, and thus pouring new wine into
old bottles. There is a possibility that the picture must be dated back
to the age of demonolatry, when the idea prevailed that the good god
need not be worshipped but only the evil god, because he alone is
dangerous to mankind.

That the same idea as expressed in the Buddhist wheel of life existed in
the remotest antiquity of our earliest civilisations can be seen at a
glance by looking at the picture of the Chaldean bronze tablet (on page
46 of this volume), which represents the three worlds, the realm of the
gods, the abode of men, and the domain of the dead, as being held in the
clutches of a terrible monster. The similarity of the tablet to the
Buddhist wheel of life is too striking to be fortuitous.

Religious symbols, formulas, and rites are, as a rule, punctiliously
preserved even after a radical change of the fundamental ideas that are
embodied therein. Judging by analogy from the religious evolution of
other nations, we must assume that the original form of worship among
the Accadians was as much demonolatrous as it is at a certain stage of
civilisation among all savage tribes, and this bronze plate appears to
preserve the lingering features

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

of a prehistoric world-conception. The simplest explanation that
suggests itself is to regard the monster holding the world-picture as
the deity of evil, who in the period when religion still consisted
merely in the fear of evil, was worshipped as the actual prince of the
world whose wrath was propitiated by bloody sacrifices.

If this view should prove to be correct, the Chaldean bronze plate of
the monster holding in its claws the world would be the connecting link
between the very dawn of religious notions with the foundation of
Buddhism, where the worship of the evil deity has disappeared entirely.
But the influence of this old mode of expression extends even into the
sphere of the origin of Christianity, although here it fades from sight.
In the New Testament the Buddhist term "the wheel of life" is used once
more, but it is a mere echo of a remote past; its original significance
is no longer understood. Speaking of the great damage caused in the
world by the tongue, St. James says:

"οὕτως ἡ γλῶσσα καϑίσταται ἐν τοῖσ μέλεσιν ἡμῶν ἡ σπιλοῦσα ὅλον τὸ σῶμα·
καὶ φλογίϩουσα τὸν τροχὸν τῆς γενέσεως, καὶ φλογιϩομένη ὑπὸ τῆς
γεέννης·"

\[Thus the tongue that defileth the whole body standeth among our limbs;
and it setteth on fire the wheel of becoming and is set on fire by
hell.\]

The version of King James translates the term τροχὸς γενέσεως which in
the Vulgate reads *rosa nativitatis*, by course of nature."

*Northern Buddhism*.

The Buddhism of Tibet is not yet sufficiently explored on account of the
inaccessibility of the country,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

but it is safe to say that its demonology is highly developed and shows
traces of strong Hindu influences. Prominent

among, the evil spirits is mKha'sGroma, the Tibetan form of the Hindu

surrounded by a halo of flames and ready to devour everything she sees.

In China Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism exist peacefully side by
side, and there is scarcely a home in the country where the customary
homage would not be paid to Lao-Tsze and Confucius as well as to Buddha.
Indeed, there are numerous illustrations in which these three great
masters are together represented as dominating the moral life of China.

In Japan the conditions are similar, except that in the place of the
popular Taoism we find Shintoism, which is the aboriginal nature-worship
of the country, consisting at present in the observation of national
festivals, in which form it has of late been declared to be the official
state religion of the country.

The folklore of Chinese Taoism and Japanese Shintoism was naturally
embodied in the mythology of the Buddhists, and we find therefore in
their temples innumerable representations of hell with all their
traditional belongings; Emma, the stern judge of Meifu, the dark
tribunal; Kongo, the sheriff, and all the terrible staff of bailiffs,
torturers, and executioners, among whom the steer-headed Gozu and the
horse-headed Mezu are never missing. By the side of the judge's desk
stands the most perfect mirror imaginable, for it reflects the entire
personality of every being. Since man's personality, according to the
Buddhistic soul-conception, is constituted by the deeds done during
life, the glass makes apparent all the words, thoughts, and actions of
the delinquent who is led before it; whereupon he is dealt with
according to his deserts. If good deeds prevail, he is rewarded by being

reincarnated in a higher state of existence, be it on earth, or in the
Western Paradise, or in one of the heavens of the gods; or, if bad deeds
prevail, he sinks into lower spheres, in which case he must go back to
life in the shape of that creature which represents his peculiar
character; or, if he has been very wicked, he is doomed to hell, whither
he is carried in the *ho nokuruma*, the fiery cart, the conveyance of
the infernal regions. The sentence is pronounced in these words:

<span class="small">"Thy evil deeds are not the work of thy mother,
father, relatives, friends, advisers. Thou alone hast done them all;
thou alone must gather the fruit." (Devad. S.)</span>

Dragged to the place of torment, he is fastened to red hot irons,
plunged into fiery lakes of blood, raked over burning coals, and "he
dies not till the last residue of his guilt has been expiated."

But the Devil is not always taken seriously, and it appears that the
Chinese and Japanese exhibit all the humor they are capable of in their
devil pictures and statues, among which the Oni-no-Nembutzu, the Devil
as a monk, is perhaps the most grotesque figure.

the evils of this world, represented in various devil personalities, are
conceived as incarnations of Buddha himself, who, by showing the evil
consequences of sin, endeavors to convert mankind to holiness and
virtue.

We find in the Buddhist temples of China and Japan so-called Mandaras,
which represent the world-conception of Buddhism in its cosmic entirety.
The word Mandara means "a complete *ensemble*," and it exhibits a
systematically arranged group of Buddha-incarnations. The

statue of the highest Buddha who dwells in Nirvana always stands in the
centre. It is "Bodhi," enlightenment, or "Sambodhi," perfect
enlightenment, that is to say, the Truth, eternal rightness, or rather,
Verity, the objective reality that is represented in truth, which is the
same forever and aye. He is personified under the name Amitabha, which
means boundless light, being that something the recognition of which
constitutes Buddhahood. He is like God, the Father of the Christians,
omnipresent and eternal, the light and life of the world, and the

ultimate authority of moral conduct. Another prominent Buddha
incarnation is Maitreya, the Buddha to come, who is the Christian holy
spirit. He is the comforter whose appearance was promised by Buddha
shortly before parting from his disciples.

The catalogue of the Musée Guimet of Paris, the best religious museum in
the world, describes a Mandara, in which the highest Buddha in the
centre of the group is surrounded by a number of his incarnations of
various degrees and dignities. These are the Bodhisattvas, prophets and
sages of the world, who have either taught mankind or set them good
examples by their virtuous lives. On the right we see a group of
personified abstracts, piety, charity, science, religion, the aspiration
for progress. On the left is a third class, consisting of the ugly
figures of demons, whose appearance is destined to frighten people away
from sensuality, egotism, and evil desires.

The devils of Buddhism, accordingly, are not the enemies of Buddha, and
not even his antagonists, but his ministers and co-workers. They partake
of Buddha's nature, for they, too, are teachers. They are the rods of
punishment, representing the curse of sin, and as such have also been
fitly conceived as incarnations of the Bodhi. In this interpretation,
the Buddhist devils cease to be torturers and become instruments of
education who contribute their share to the general system of working
out the final salvation of man.

Christian salvation consists in an atonement of sin through the bloody
sacrifice of a sinless redeemer; Buddhist salvation is attained through
enlightenment. Hence
