# PERSIAN DUALISM.

HE TRANSITION from Devil-worship to God-worship marks the origin of
civilisation; and among the nations of antiquity the Persians seem to
have been the first who took this step with conscious deliberation, for
they most earnestly insisted upon the contrast that obtains between good
and evil, so much so that their religion is even to-day regarded as the
most consistent form of dualism.

The founder of Persian dualism was Zarathustra, or, as the Greeks called
him, "Zoroaster"--a name which in its literal translation means "golden
splendor."

Zoroaster, the great prophet of Mazdaism (the belief in Mazda, the
Omniscient One), it is rightly assumed, was not so much the founder of a
new era as the concluding link in a long chain of aspiring prophets
before him. The field was ripe for the harvest when he appeared, and
others must have prepared the way for his movement.

Zoroaster is in all later writings represented as a demigod, a fact
which suggested to Professor Darmesteter the idea that he was a mythical
figure. Nevertheless, and although we know little of Zoroaster's life,
we

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

have the documentary evidence in the "Gathas" that he was a real
historical personality.

Prof. A. V. Williams Jackson in an essay "On the Date of
Zoroaster" <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) arrives at the conclusion
that he lived between the latter half of the seventh and the middle of
the sixth century, and Dr. E. W. West <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) points out that the calendar reform, in
which the old Persian names of the months were supplanted by Zoroastrian
names, was introduced in the year 505 B. C. This proves that the kings
of the Achæmenian dynasty were Zoroastrians. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19.md) Professor Jackson says:

<span class="small">"The kingdom of Bactria was the scene of Zoroaster's
zealous ministry, as I presume. Born, as I believe, in Atropatene, to
the west of Media, this prophet without honor in his own country met
with a congenial soil for the seeds of his teaching in eastern Iran His
ringing voice of reform and of a nobler faith found an answering echo in
the heart of the Bactrian king Vishtaspa, whose strong arm gave
necessary support to the crusade that spread the new faith west and east
throughout the land of Iran. Allusions to this crusade are not uncommon
in Zoroastrian literature. Its advance must have been rapid. A fierce
religious war, which in a way was fatal to Bactria, seems to have ensued
with Turan. This was that same savage race in history at whose door the
death of victorious Cyrus is laid. Although tradition tells us the sad
story that the fire of the sacred altar was quenched in the blood of the
priests when Turan stormed Balkh, this momentary defeat was but the
gathering</span>

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="small">force of victory; triumph was at hand. The spiritual
spark of regeneration lingered among the embers and was destined soon to
burst into the flame of Persian power that swept over decaying Media and
formed the beacon-torch that lighted up the land of Iran in early
history."</span>

The Gathas are hymns; they are a product of the fifth and sixth
centuries before Christ, the authenticity of which is sufficiently
proved not only by the later Persian literature, the Pahlavi books, but
also by Greek authors, especially by passages quoted in Plutarch and
Diogenes Laertes from Theopompus, who wrote at the end of the fourth
century before Christ. The Gathas profess to be written by Zoroaster who
appears in them not as a demigod but as a struggling and suffering man,
sometimes elated by the grandeur of his aspirations, firmly convinced of
his prophetic mission, and then again dejected and full of doubt as to
the final success of the movement to which he devoted all his energies.
Says Prof. L. H. Mill, the translator of the Gathas:

"Their doctrines and exhortations concern an actual religious movement
taking place contemporaneously with their composition; and that movement
was exceptionally pure and most earnest.

"That any forgery is present in the Gathas, any desire to palm off
doctrines upon the sacred community in the name of the great prophet, as
in the Vendidad and later Yasna, is quite out of the question. The
Gathas are genuine in their mass."

There were two religious parties in the days of Zoroaster: the
worshippers of the daêvas or nature-gods, and the worshippers of Ahura,
the Lord. Zoroaster appears in the Gathas as a priest of the highest
rank who became the leader of the Ahura party. Zoroaster not only
degraded the old nature-gods, the daêvas, into demons,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

but also regarded them as representatives of a fiendish power which he
called *Angrô Mainyush*, or *Ahriman*, which means "the evil spirit,"
and *Druj*, <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) i. e., falsehood.

The Scythians in the plains of Northern Asia, the most dangerous
neighbors of Persia, worshipped their highest deity under the symbol of
a serpent, and it was natural that the snake Afrasiâb, <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) the god of the enemy, became identified
with the archfiend Ahriman.

The Persians are often erroneously called fire worshippers, but it goes
without saying that as the sun is not a god and cannot, according to
Zoroaster, in and for itself receive divine honor or be worshipped, so
the flame which is lit in praise of Ahura Mazda is a symbol only of him
who is the light of the soul and the principle of all goodness.

Zoroaster taught that Ahriman was not created by Ahura, but that he was
possessed of independent existence. The evil spirit, to be sure, was not
equal to the Lord in dignity, nor even in power; nevertheless, both were
creative, and both were original in being themselves uncreated. They
were the representatives of contradictory principles. And this doctrine
constitutes the dualism of the Persian religion, which is most
unmistakably expressed in the words of the thirtieth Yasna. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22.md)

<span class="small">"Well known are the two primeval spirits correlated
but independent; one is the better and the other is the worse as to
thought, as to word, as to deed, and between these two let the wise
choose aright."</span>

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Ahura Mazda, the Omniscient Lord, reveals himself through "the
excellent, the pure and stirring word." <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) On the rock inscription of Elvend, which
had been made by the order of king Darius, we read these lines <span
id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There is one God, omnipotent Ahura Mazda,  
It is He who has created the earth here;  
It is He who has created the heaven there;  
It is He who has created mortal man."</span>

</div>

The noble spirit of Zoroaster's religion appears from the following
formula, which was in common use among the Persians and served as an
introduction to every liturgic worship: <span
id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md)

"May Ahura be rejoiced! May Angrô be destroyed by those who do truly
what is God's all-important will.

"I praise well-considered thoughts, well-spoken words, and well-done
deeds. I embrace all good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; I reject
all evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.

"I give sacrifice and prayer unto you, O Ameshâ-Spentâ! <span
id="fr_26"></span>[4](#fn_26.md) even with the fulness of my thoughts, of
my words, of my deeds, and of my heart: I give unto you even my own
life.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

"I recite the, 'Praise of Holiness,' the *Ashem Vohu*: <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

"'Holiness is the best of all good. Well is it for it, well is it for
that holiness which is perfection of holiness!

"'I confess myself a worshipper of Mazda, a follower of Zarathustra, one
who hates the daêvas (devils) and obeys the laws of Ahura.'"

Lenormant characterises the God of Zoroaster as follows:

"Ahura Mazda has created *asha*, purity, or rather the cosmic order; he
has created both the moral and material world constitution; he has made
the universe; he has made the law; he is, in a word, creator (*datar*),
sovereign (*ahura*), omniscient (*mazdâo*), the god of order
(*ashavan*). He corresponds exactly to Varuna, the highest god of
Vedism.

"This spiritual conception of the Supreme Being is absolutely pure in
the Avesta, and the expressions that Ormuzd has the sun for his eye, the
heaven for his garment, the lightning for his sons, the waters for his
spouses, are unequivocally allegorical. Creator of all things, Ormuzd is
himself uncreated and eternal. He had no beginning and will have no end.
He has accomplished his creation work by pronouncing the Word,' the
'Ahuna-Vairyo, Honover,' i. e., 'the Word that existed before everything
else,' reminding us of the eternal Word, the Divine Logos of the
Gospel." *Histoire Ancienne de l'Orient*, V., p. 388.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

Concerning Ahriman, Lenormant says:

<span class="small">"The creation came forth from the hands of Ormuzd,
pure and perfect like himself. It was Ahriman who perverted it by his
infamous influence, and labored continually to destroy and overthrow it,
for he is the destroyer (*paurou marka*) as well as the spirit of evil.
The struggle between these two principles, of good and of evil,
constitutes the world's history. In Ahriman we find again the old
wrathful serpent of the Indo-Iranian period, who is the personification
of evil and who in Vedism, under the name of *Ahi*, is regarded as an
individual being. The myth of the serpent and the legends of the Avesta
are mingled in Ahriman under the name of *Aji Dahâka*, who is said to
have attacked Atar, Traêtaona, and Yima, but is himself dethroned. It is
the source of the Greek myth that Apollo slays the dragon Python. The
Indo-Iranian religion knows only the struggle that was carried on in the
atmosphere between the fire-god and the serpent-demon Afrasiâb. And it
was, according to Professor Darmesteter, the doctrine of this struggle,
which, when generalised and applied to all things in the world, finally
led to the establishment of dualism."</span>

Says James Darmesteter, the translator of the Zend-Avesta:

"There were two general ideas at the bottom of the Indo-Iranian
religion; first, that there is a law in nature, and secondly, that there
is a war in nature (*Sacred Books of the East*, IV., p. lvii),

The law in nature: proves the wisdom of Ahura, who is therefore called
Mazda, the Wise. The war in nature is due to the intrusion of Ahriman
into the creation of Ahura.

The fire sacrifice was accompanied by partaking of the haoma drink, a
ceremony which reminds us on the one hand of the soma sacrifice of the
Vedic age in India and on the other hand of the Lord's Supper of the
Christians.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

We know through the sacred scriptures of the Persians that little cakes
(the *draona*) covered with small pieces of holy meat (the *myazda*)
were consecrated in the name of a spiritual being, a god or angel, or of
some great deceased personality, and then distributed among all the
worshippers that were present. But more sacred still than the draona
with the myazda is the haoma drink which was prepared from the white
haoma plant, also called gaokerena. Says Professor Darmesteter: "It is
by the drinking of gaokerena that men, on the day of the resurrection,
will become immortal."

The way in which the Persian sacrament of drinking the gaokerena was
still celebrated in the times of early Christianity, must have been very
similar to the Christian communion, for Justinus, when speaking of the
Lord's Supper among the Christians, adds "that this very solemnity, too,
the evil spirits have introduced in the mysteries of Mithra."

After death, according to the Zoroastrian doctrine, the soul must pass
over *cinvato pertush*, that is, the "accountant's bridge," where its
future fate is decided. This bridge stretches over the yawning abyss of
hell, from the peak of Judgment to the divine Mount Alborz, and becomes,
according to the most common statements of the doctrine, broad to the
good, a pathway of nine javelins in breadth, while to the wicked it is
like the edge of a razor. Evil doers fall into the power of Ahriman and
are doomed to hell; the good enter *garô demâna*, the life of bliss;
while those in whom good and evil are equal, remain in an intermediate
state, the *Hamêstakâns* of the Pahlavi books, until the great
judgment-day (called *âka*).

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

The most characteristic features of the Persian 'religion after the
lifetime of Zoroaster consist in the teaching that a great crisis is
near at hand, which will lead to the renovation of the world called
*frashôkereti* in the Avesta, and *frashakart* in Pahlavi. Saviours will
come, born of the seed of Zoroaster, and in the end the great Saviour
who will bring about the resurrection of the dead. He will be the "son
of a virgin" and the "All-conquering." His name shall be the Victorious
(*verethrajan*), Righteousness-incarnate (*astvat-ereta*), and the
Saviour (*saoshya<u>n</u>t*). Then the living shall become immortal, yet
their bodies will be transfigured so that they will cast no shadows, and
the dead shall rise, "within their lifeless bodies incorporate life
shall be restored." (Fr. 4. 3.)  <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) The
Persian belief in the advent of a saviour who will make mankind immortal
seems to reappear in an intenser form in the days of John the Baptist
and Jesus of Nazareth, who preached that the kingdom of heaven is near
at hand. St. Paul still believed that the second advent of Christ would
take place during his own life-time. The dead who sleep in the Lord be
resurrected, and the bodies of those that are still in the flesh will be
transfigured and become immortal.

The influence of Zoroaster's religion upon Judaism and early
Christianity cannot be doubted. Not only does the original text of the
book of Ezra directly declare that "Cyrus, the King, built the house of
the Lord in Jerusalem, where they worship him with the eternal fire"

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (διὰ πυρὸσ
ἐνδελεχοῦς), but there are many Jewish ceremonies preserved to the
present day, which bear a close resemblance to the ritual of ancient
Mazdaism. In addition there is a documentary evidence preserved in "The
Arabic Gospel of the Infancy" (Chapter 7), that the Magi came from the
Fast to Jerusalem according to a prophecy of Zoroaster.

The Persian world-conception, like the religion of the Jews, was too
abstract to favor any artistic development. <span

either good or evil spirits which are exclusively and peculiarly
Persian. Even the picture of Ahura Mazda (as we find it on various
bas-reliefs) is not based upon a conception that could be said to be
regarded as original. The figure from which the bust of the god of light
and goodness rises can be traced to Assyrian emblems, and may, for all
we know, be of Accadian origin. There is, for instance, an Assyrian
cylinder which represents a

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

worshipper standing before the idol of a god. Behind him is the tree of
life and a priest carrying in his left hand a rosary, while the deity
hovers above them in a similar shape to the Ahura-Mazda pictures of the
Persians.

Ahura Mazda is pictured as a winged disc without any head, in the style
of Chaldean sun-pictures, in a cameo representing him as worshipped by
two sphinxes, between whom the sacred haoma plant is seen (see [p.
59](#page_59)). In another cameo (see [p. 59](#page_59).md) he appears as a

There are some magnificent representations of Ahura-Mazda on ancient

his appearance, which lifts his picture above the Assyrian conception of
deities. In his hands he holds either a ring or the short royal staff of
rulers, appearing at the top like a lotus flower.

Prof. A. V. Williams Jackson explains the ring in the hands of Ahura
Mazda as "the Circle of Sovereignty," <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) and interprets the loop with streamers in
which the figure floats as a variation of the same idea, for in some of
the pictures it appears as a chaplet, or waist-garland with
ribbons. <span id="fr_31"></span>[2](#fn_31.md)

It is not possible that the loop with streamers is originally a disc
representing the disc of the sun after the fashion of Egyptian temple
decorations. At any rate, there are a great number of Assyrian
sculptures of the same type which are unequivocally representations of
the sun. A cylinder (published in Lajard's *Culte de Mithra*, plate
XLIX., No. 2) illustrating the myth of god Isdubar's descent to
Hasisatra, shows the two scorpion-genii of the horizon watching the rise
and the setting of the sun. Here the sun appears, like the figure from
which Ahura Mazda rises, as a winged disc with feather-tail and
streamers. In addition, we find the same picture in the deity that
protects the tree of life, which can only signify the benign influence
of the sun on plants (see [p. 36](hod06.htm#page_36).md); and the old
Babylonian cylinder representing Merodach's fight with the evil spirit
that darkens

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the moon (see p. [37](hod06.htm#page_37).md), shows the feathered dial in
this same conventional shape covered with clouds. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)

A representation of Ahriman has not yet been discovered among the
Persian antiquities. There is, however, a bas-relief in Persepolis which
depicts the king in the act of slaying a unicorn. The monster is very
similar to the Assyrian Tiamat (see [p. 41](hod06.htm#page_41).md), and we
cannot doubt that the Persian sculptor imitated the style of his
Assyrian predecessors.

We have little information concerning the origin of Zoroaster's dualism,
but we can nevertheless reconstruct it at least in rough outlines. For
there are witnesses left, even to-day, of the historical past of the old
Persian religion. A sect called the Izedis are the fossil
representatives of the Devil-worship that preceded the purer notions of
the Zoroastrian worship prevailing in the Zend-Avesta. Following the
authority of a German traveller, Tylor says (*Primitive Culture*, Vol.
II., p. 329):

<span class="small">"The Izedis or Yezidis, the so-called
Devil-worshippers, still remain a numerous though oppressed people in
Mesopotamia and adjacent countries. Their adoration of the sun and
horror of defiling fire accord with the idea of a Persian origin of
their religion (Persian "*ized*" = God), an origin underlying more
superficial admixture</span>

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="small">of Christian and Moslem elements. This remarkable
sect is distinguished by a special form of dualism. While recognising
the existence of a Supreme Being, their peculiar reverence is given to
Satan, chief of the angelic host, who now has the means of doing evil to
mankind, and in his restoration will have the power of rewarding them.
'Will not Satan then reward the poor Izedis, who alone have never spoken
ill of him, and have suffered so much for him?' Martyrdom for the rights
of Satan! exclaims the German traveller, to whom an old white-bearded
Devil-worshipper thus set forth the hopes of his religion."</span>

This peculiar creed of the Izedis is similar to the religion of
Devil-worshipping savages in so far as the recognition of the good
powers is not entirely lacking, but it is, as it were, a merely negative
element; the positive importance of goodness is not yet recognised. It
is probable that the Persians in prehistoric times were as much
Devil-worshippers as are the Izedis. The daêvas, the deities of the
irresistible forces of nature, were pacified by sacrifices. A
recognition of the power of moral endeavor as represented in the
personified virtues, the Ameshâ Spentâ, was the product of a slow
development. Thus in Persia the Devil-worship of the daêvas yielded to
the higher religion of God-worship; and this change marks a decided step
in advance, resulting soon afterwards in the Persians' becoming one of
the leading nations of the world.

and the words of Zoroaster (Ζωροάστρου λόγια) were called to mind that
the fire should not be defiled. Therefore the Persians shouted that the
life of Croesus should be spared. Compare Harlez, *Avesta traduit*,

(the undying and well-doing ones) are what Christians might call
archangels. Originally they had been seven, but the first and greatest
among them, Ahura Mazda, came to overshadow the divinity of the other
six. They remained powerful gods, but he was regarded as their father
arid creator. We read in *Yast*, XIX., 16, that they have "one and the
same thinking, one and the same speaking, one and the same doing, one
and the same father and lord, who is Ahura Mazda."

At first the Ameshâ Spentâ were mere personifications of virtues, but
later on they were entrusted with the government of the various domains
of the universe. <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> Haurvatât and Ameretât

Indo-Iranian era; and *Vohu Manô* (good thought) superintended the

Marcell Dienlafoy's work *L'art antique de la Perse*, in which for the

of interest.

Circle of Sovereignty," in the *American Oriental Society's
Proceedings*, May, 1889.
