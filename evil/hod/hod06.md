# ACCAD AND THE EARLY SEMITES.

BOUT THE YEAR 3000 B. C., long before the Arise of the Semitic nations,
among whom the Babylonians, Assyrians, Israelites, and later the
Arabians, were most prominent, there lived in Mesopotamia a nation of
great power and importance, which is known by the name of Accad. And,
strange to say, the Accadians were not a white, but a dark race. They
are spoken of as "blackheads" or "blackfaces"; yet we need not for that
reason assume that they were actually as black as the Ethiopians, for
the bilingual tablets found in the mounds of Babylonia speak also of
them as *Adamatu* <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) or red-skins,
which makes it probable that they were reddish-dark or brown. How much
the Semites owe to the Accadians, whose dominion ceased about 1500 B.
C., and whose language began to die out under the reign of the Assyrian
king Sargon (722-705), we may infer from the fact that many religious
institutions, legends, and customs among the Semites were of Accadian
origin.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

Thus we know for certain that in their mode of determining the time they
already possessed the institution of a week of seven days, and that the
Sabbath was their holy day of rest. The literal meaning of the original
Accadian word is explained as "a day on which work is unlawful," and the
Assyrian translation *Sabattu* signifies cc a day of rest for the
heart." Further, the legends of creation, of the tree of life, and of
the deluge, mentioned in Genesis and also in Assyrian records, were well
known to the Accadians, and from the conventional form of the tree of
life, which in the most ancient pictures bears fir-cones, we may infer
that the idea is an old tradition which the Accadians brought with them
from their former and colder home in the fir-covered mountains of Media.
In addition we have reminiscences of Accadian traditions in many Hebrew
names, which proves beyond the shadow of a doubt the long-lasting
influence of the ancient civilisation of Accad. The rivers of paradise,
mentioned in Genesis, are Babylonian names. Thus, the Euphrates, or
*Purat*, is the curving water; Tigris is *Tiggur*, the current;
Hid-Dekhel, "the river with the high bank," is another name for the
Tigris, which in inscriptions is called *Idikla* or *Idikna*; Gihon has
been identified by some Assyriologists with *Arakhtu* (Araxes), and by
Sir H. Rawlinson with Jukha; and King Sargon calls Elam "the country of
the four rivers."

The names of the rivers of Eden indicate that the people with whom the
legend of paradise originated must have lived on the banks of the
Euphrates and Tigris. Under these circumstances we are surprised to find
that the cultivated portion of the desert lands west of the

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Euphrates was called *Edinna*, <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) a
name that sounds very much like Eden.

About the time of Alexander the Great, a Babylonian priest by the name
of Berosus wrote an interesting book on the history and religion of
Babylon. It is now lost, but as various Greek authors, Alexander
Polyhistor, Apollodorus, Abydenus, Damascius, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) and Eusebius have largely quoted from his
reports, we know quite a good deal about the information he gave to the
world concerning his country.

All this was very interesting, but there was no evidence of the
reliability of Berosus's records. The Babylonian legends might have been
derived from the Old Testament. However, since the successful
excavations of the Assyrian stone-libraries we have the most positive
evidences as to the source and the great age of these traditions. A
great part of them have come down to us from the old Accadians.

We know that the Babylonians possessed several legends which have been
received into the Old Testament, the most striking ones being the legend
of the deluge, of the tower of Babel, of the destruction of corrupt
cities by a rain of fire (reminding us of Sodom and Gomorrah), of the
babyhood adventures of King Sargon I. (reminding us of Moses), and of
the creation of the world. The name of Babel, which is in Assyrian
*bab-ilani*, or *bab-ilu*, i. e. the Gate of God, is a Semitic
translation of the Accadian *Ka-dingirra-ki*, with the same meaning;
literally:

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Gate + of God +
the place." The etymology of the name Babel from *balbel*, "to
confound," which is suggested both in the Assyrian account of the story
and in Genesis, is one of those popular etymologic errors which are
frequently found in ancient authors.

</span>

In the legend of the destruction of the cities there occur several names
which indicate an Accadian source. The legend of the deluge <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) agrees in all important details with the
analogous story in Genesis. It is the eleventh part of a larger epic
celebrating Izdubar, <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) a sun-hero and
an Assyrian Hercules, who goes through the twelve signs of the Zodiac,

Who has not yet seen, even in our most modern cathedrals, pictures and
statues of the four Evangelists adorned with the four representative
beings of the animal creation? Matthew is accompanied by an angel or a

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

winged man, Mark by a lion, Luke by a steer, and St. John by an eagle.
The creatures represent the cherubim of the Old Testament, who by the
early Christians were conceived as the guardians and heavenly prototypes
of the Gospel-writers. But these symbols are not original with the Jews;
they are of a more venerable

</span>

age than even the Old Testament; for we find them on the walls of the
ancient royal palaces of Nineveh, and there can be no doubt about it
that the Jewish conception of the cherubim is the heirloom of a most
hoary antiquity.

About Sargon I., king of Agade, who, according to a tablet of King
Nabonidus, lived 3754 B. C. and built

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

a temple to Samas, Mr. E. A. Wallis Budge says in his *Babylonian Life
and History*, p. 40,:

<span class="small">"A curious legend is extant respecting this king, to
the effect that he was born in a city on the banks of the Euphrates,
that his mother conceived him in secret and brought him forth in a
humble place that she placed him in an ark of rushes and closed it with
pitch that she cast him upon the river in the water-tight ark; that the
river carried him along; that he was rescued by a man called Akki, who
brought him up to his own trade; and that from this position the goddess
Istar made him king."</span>

As to the Assyrio-Babylonian origin of these legends there can be no
doubt. The best authorities agree--

<span class="small">"that Chaldea was the original home of these stories
and that the Jews received them originally from the Babylonians." (Smith
Sayce, *The Chaldean Account of Genesis*, p. 312.)</span>

The numerous illustrations that have been found or early Assyrian and
Babylonian seals prove--

<span class="small">"that the legends were well known and formed part of
the literature of the country before the second millennium B. C."
(*Ib*., p. 331.)</span>

It is probable that all the old Chaldean legends existed in several
versions. Of the creation story we possess two accounts which vary
considerably; but one of them, which is narrated on seven tablets, is of
special interest to us, not only on account of its being the main source
of the first chapter of the Old Testament, but also because we possess
in it one of the oldest documents in which the existence of the Evil One
is mentioned. He is called in Assyrian *Tiamtu*, i. e., the deep, and is
represented as the serpent that beats the sea, the serpent of the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

night, the serpent of darkness, the wicked serpent, and the mighty and
strong serpent.

The derivation of the biblical account of Creation from Assyrian sources
can as little be doubted as that of other legends, not only because of
its agreement in several important features, and in many unimportant
ones, but also because sometimes the very words used in Genesis are the
same as in the Assyrian inscriptions. We find in both records such
coincidences as the creation of woman from the rib of man and the
sending out of birds from the ark to ascertain whether the waters had
subsided. First the birds returned at once, then they returned,
according to the cuneiform tablet-inscriptions of the Assyrians, with
their feet covered with mud; at last they returned no more. Further, the
Hebrew *Mehûmâh*, confusion, chaos, is the Assyrian Mummu, while the
Hebrew *tehôm*, the deep, and *tohû*, desolate, correspond to the
Assyrian *Tiamtu* (= *Tiamat*).

Our excavators have not as yet found a report of the fall of man and of
the serpent that seduced Adam and Eve to taste the fruit of the tree of
life. There is, however, a great probability that some similar legend
existed, as we are in possession of pictures which represent two persons
seated under a tree and a serpent near by.

The tree of life is an idea which must have been very popular among the
Assyrians and Babylonians, for

their artists do not tire of depicting it in every form. It may date
back to that remote period when the fruits of

Tiamat is the original watery chaos from which heaven and earth were
generated. Babylonian philosophers see in it the mother of the world and
the source of all things, while in mythology it appears as the
representative of disorder and the mother of the monsters of the deep.

After a long struggle Tiamat was conquered, as we read in the fourth
tablet of the creation-story, by the Sun-god, Belus or Bel-Merodach. The
struggle, however, is not finished, for the demon of evil is living
still and Bel

has to fight the seven wicked storm-demons who darken the moon. He kills
dragons and evil spirits, and the reappearance of divine intelligence in
rational creatures is symbolised in the myth that Bel commanded one of
the gods to cut off his, i. e. Bel's head, in order to mix the blood
with the earth for the procreation of animals which should be able to
endure the light.

We here reproduce a brief statement of the Babylonian story of the
creation, in which Tiamat plays an important part. Professor Sayce says
(*Records of the Past*, New Series, Vol. I., pp. 128-131):

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

"A good deal of the poem consists of the words put into the mouth of the
god Merodach, derived possibly from older lays. The first tablet or
book, however, expresses the cosmological doctrines of the author's own
day. It opens before the beginning of time, the expression 'at that
time' answering to the expression 'in the beginning' of Genesis. The
heavens and earth had not yet been created, and since the name was
supposed to be the same as the thing named, their names had not as yet
been pronounced. A watery chaos alone existed, Mummu Tiamat, 'the chaos
of the deep.' Out of the bosom of this chaos proceeded the gods as well
as the created world. First came the primæval divinities, Lakhmu and
Lakhamu, words of unknown meaning, and then An-sar and Ki-sar, 'the
upper' and 'lower firmament.' Last of all were born the three supreme
gods of the Babylonian faith, Ann the sky-god, Bel or Illil the lord of
the ghost-world, and Ea the god of the river and sea.

"But before the younger gods could find a suitable habitation for
themselves and their creation, it was necessary to destroy 'the dragon'
of chaos with all her monstrous offspring. The task was undertaken by
the Babylonian sun-god Merodach, the son of Ea, An-sar promising him
victory, and the other gods providing for him his arms. The second
tablet was occupied with an account of the preparations made to ensure
the victory of light over darkness, and order over anarchy.

"The third tablet described the success of the god of light over the
allies of Tiamat. Light was introduced into the world, and it only
remained to destroy Tiamat herself. The combat is described in the
fourth tablet, which takes the form of a poem in honor of Merodach, and
is probably an earlier poem incorporated into his text by the author of
the epic. Tiamat was slain and her allies put in bondage, while the
books of destiny which had hitherto been possessed by the older race of
gods were now transferred to the younger deities of the new world. The
visible heaven was formed out of the skin of Tiamat, and became the
outward symbol of Ansar

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

and the habitation of Ann, Bel, and Ea, while the chaotic waters of the
dragon became the law-bound sea ruled over by Ea.

"The heavens having been thus made, the fifth tablet tells us how they
were furnished with mansions for the sun, and moon, and stars, and how
the heavenly bodies were bound down by fixed laws that they might
regulate the calendar and determine the year. The sixth tablet probably
described the creation of the earth, as well as of vegetables, birds,
and fish. In the seventh tablet the creation of animals and reptiles was
narrated, and doubtless also that of mankind.

"It will be seen from this that in its main outlines the Assyrian epic
of the creation bears a striking resemblance to the account of it given
in the first chapter of Genesis. In each case the history of the
creation is divided into seven successive acts; in each case the present
world has been preceded by a watery chaos. In fact the self-same word is
used of this chaos in both the Biblical and Assyrian accounts--*tehôm*,
*Tiamat*--the only difference being that in the Assyrian story 'the
deep' has become a mythological personage, the mother of a chaotic
brood. The order of the creation, moreover, agrees in the two accounts;
first the light, then the creation of the firmament of heaven,
subsequently the appointment of the celestial bodies 'for signs and for
seasons and for days and years,' and next, the creation of beasts and
'creeping things.' But the two accounts also differ in some important
particulars. In the Assyrian epic the earth seems not to have been made
until after the appointment of the heavenly bodies, instead of before
it, as in Genesis, and the seventh day is a day of work instead of rest,
while there is nothing corresponding to the statement of Genesis that
'the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.' But the most
important difference consists in the interpolation of the struggle
between Merodach and the powers of evil, as a consequence of which light
was introduced into the universe, and the firmament of the heavens was
formed.

"It has long since been noted that the conception of this struggle
stands in curious parallelism to the verses of the Apocalypse

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">(Rev. xii, 7-9): 'And there was war in heaven: Michael and
his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his
angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world.' We are also reminded
of the words of Isaiah, xxiv. 21, 22: 'The Lord shall punish the host of
the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the
earth. And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered in
the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison.'"</span>

The Babylonians worshipped many deities, but their favorite god was Bel,
who is frequently identified with Merodach, on account of his struggle
with Tiamat.

Bel-Merodach is one of the great trinity of Anu, Ea, and Bel, which on
an ancient cylinder is pictured as hovering above the tree of life
before which two human forms, apparently king and queen, are seen in an
attitude of adoration.

The Babylonian trinity was thought to be male and

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

female, and it is noteworthy that the female representative of the
divine father Anu, the god-mother Anna, also called Istar, was
worshipped under the symbol of a dove, which in a purer and nobler form
reappears in Christianity as an emblem of most significant spirituality.

Bel-Merodach is the Christ of the Babylonians, for he is spoken of as
the son of the god Ea, the personification of all knowledge and wisdom.
Professor Budge says:

<span id="img_04100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIGHT BETWEEN

<span class="small">"The omnipresent and omnipotent Marduk (Merodach)
was the god, who 'went before Ea' and was the healer and mediator for
mankind. He revealed to mankind the knowledge of Ea; in all incantations
he is invoked as the god 'mighty to save' against evil and
ill."--*Babylonian Life and History*, p. 127.</span>

The struggle between Bell-Merodach and Tiamat was a favorite subject
with Assyrian artists. In one of them,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

which is now preserved in the British Museum, the Evil One is
represented as a monster with claws and horns, with a tail and wings,
and covered with scales.

Concerning the Evil One and hell, as conceived by the Babylonians, Mr.
Budge says, pp. 139, 140:

"Their Hades was not so very far different from Sheol, or the 'pit' of
the Bible, nor the Devil much to be distinguished from the Satan we read
of."

<span class="small">"The Babylonian conception of hell is made known to
us by a tablet which relates the descent of Istar thither in search of
her lovely young husband, Tammuz. It has been stated that the same word
for Hades, i. e. Sheol, as that used in the Hebrew Scriptures, has been
found in Babylonian texts; but this assertion has been made while the
means for definitely proving it do not at present exist. The lady of the
Babylonian Hades was called Nin-kigal, and the place itself had a river
running through it, over which spirits had to cross. There was also 'a
porter of the waters' (which reminds us of the Charon of the Greeks),
and it had seven gates. The tablet mentioned above tells us
that--</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. To the land of no return, to the afar off, to regions of
corruption,  
2. Istar, the daughter of the Moon-god, her attention firmly  
3. fixed, the daughter of the Moon-god, her attention fixed  
4. the house of corruption, the dwelling of the deity Irkalla (to go)  
5 to the house whose entrance is without exit  
6. to the road whose way is without return  
7. to the house whose entrance is bereft of light  
8. a place where much dust is their food, their meat mud,  
9. where light is never seen, where they dwell in darkness  
10. ghosts (?) like birds whirl round and round the vaults  
11. over the doors and wainscoting there is thick dust.

</div>

<span class="small">"The outer gate of this 'land of no return' was
strongly guarded and bolted, for the porter, having refused to grant
Istar admission, the goddess says--</span>

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Open thy gate and let me enter in;  
If thou openest not the gate, and I come not in,  
I force the gate, the bolt I shatter,  
I strike the threshold, and I cross the doors,  
I raise the dead, devourers of the living,

</div>

<span class="small">"There is another name for Hades, the signs which
form it meaning 'the house of the land of the dead.' A gloss gives its
pronunciation as *Arali*. Such, then, is the Babylonian hell. It is
difficult to say where they imagined their Hades to be, but it has been
conjectured by some that they thought it to be in the west."</span>

Besides Tiamat there were in Assyrian and Babylonian mythology
innumerable demons whose names are known through the inscriptions and
whose portraits are preserved on statues, bas-reliefs, and cylinders.
The magic formulae which were employed to ward off their influence are
always uttered seven times in the Sumero-Accadian language which was
deemed more sacred on account of its age, for it had become
unintelligible for the common people and remained in use only for
liturgic purposes. The Assyrians expected to frighten demons away by
showing them their own shape and by exhorting them to destroy themselves
mutually in an internecine combat.

"In the army of the Good as well as in the army of Evil, there obtains a
hierarchical system of more or less powerful spirits according to their
rank. The texts mention the *ekim* and the *telal* or warrior; the
*maskin* or trapper; the *alal* or destroyer; the *labartu*, the
*labassu*, the *ahharu*, kind of ghosts, phantoms, and vampires.
Frequently the *mas*, the *lamma*, and the *utuq* are quoted; and a
distinction is made between the good and the evil *mas*, the good and
the evil *lamma*, the good and the evil *utuq*. There are also the
*alapi* or winged bulls, the *nirgalli* or winged lions, and the
innumerable kinds of heavenly archangels. The gods Anna and Ea, called
the spirit of heaven (*zi an na*) and the spirit of the earth (*zi ki
a*), as the gods of every science, are commonly invoked in incantations
as alone able to protect mankind against the attacks of the evil
spirits. The monuments of Chaldea prove the existence of an extremely
complex demonology the exact gradation of which is not yet sufficiently
known."

Concerning the Devil of the disease-engendering southwest wind Lenormant
says (*ibid*. V., p. 212):

<span class="small">"The Louvre possesses the image of a horrible demon

<span class="small">AN ANCIENT ASSYRIAN BRONZE TABLET REPRESENTING THE
WORLD IN THE CLUTCHES OF AN EVIL DEMON. Collection of M. de Clercq.
(After Lenormant).</span>

<span class="small">in incantation: 'The evil demons should get out,
they should mutually kill one another.'"</span>

There is an ancient bronze tablet which shows the picture of the world
in the clutches of the Devil. Lenormant, when speaking of the Chaldean
conception of hell, alludes to this remarkable piece of antiquity and
describes it as follows:

<span class="small">"A bronze plate in the collection of M. De Clercq
contains in a synoptic world-picture a representation of hell, and it is
necessary</span>

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

that we here give a description of it. One side of the bronze plate is
entirely occupied by a four-footed monster, with four wings, standing on
eagle's claws. Raising himself on his hind feet, be looks as though he
intended to jump over the plate against which he leans. His head reaches
over the border as over the top of a wall. The face of the wild and
roaring monster towers, on the other side of the plate, above a picture
which is divided into four horizontal strips representing the heavens,
the earth, and hell. In the top strip one sees the symbolic
representations of the celestial bodies. Underneath appears a series of
seven persons clad in long robes and having beads of a lion, a dog, a
bear, a ram, a horse, an eagle, and a serpent. These are the celestial
genii called *ighigs*. The third strip exhibits a funeral scene, which
undoubtedly happens on earth. Two personages dressed in the skin of a
fish, after the fashion of the god Anu, are standing at the head and
foot of a mummy. Further on there are two genii--one with a lion's head,
the other with a jackal's head--who threaten one another with their
daggers, and a man seems to flee from this scene of horror. The picture
of the fourth strip is bathed in the floods of the ocean, which
according to the traditional mythology of the Chaldeans reaches
underneath the foundations of the earth. An ugly monster, half bestial,
half human, with eagles' wings and claws, and a tail terminating in a
snake's head, stands on the shore of the ocean, on which a boat is
floating. This is the boat of the deity Elippu, frequently mentioned in
the religious texts and probably the prototype of the boat of Charon in
Greek mythology. In the boat is a horse which carries upon its back a
gigantic lion-headed deity, holding in her hands two serpents; and two
little lions jump to her breast to suck her milk. In the corner there
are fragments of all kinds, human limbs, vases, and the remainders of a
feast.

"Thus this little bronze tablet contains the picture of the world such
as the imagination of the Chaldeans represented it to be: the gods and
the sidereal powers, angels and demons, ighigs and anunnaks, the earth
and men, with supernatural beings who exercise a direct influence upon
them: the dead protected by certain demons

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="small">and attacked by others according to the
philosophical conception of good and evil, and the antagonism of the two
principles which constitutes the basis of the Assyrio-Chaldean religion.
Anu protects the dead in the same way as does the Egyptian Osiris. There
is the subterranean river reminding one of the Styx and Acheron of the
Greeks as well as of the subterranean Nile of Amenti." (P. 291.)</span>

It goes without saying that the old biblical legends, far from losing
their value by being proved to be much older, gain air additional value;
they are now more interesting to us than ever. Formerly the biblical
account of the creation was thought to be the very beginning of the
religious evolution of man, but now we know that it is merely a
milestone on the road. It is neither the beginning nor the end. It is
simply the summary of a long history of anxious inquiry and speculation,
which would have remained forgotten had we not discovered the Assyrian
tablets bearing witness to the aspirations that preceded the composition
of the Old Testament. But there is one thing which seems strange: the
Chaldean belief in the immortality of the soul found no echo in the
literature of the Jews. Did they refuse to incorporate it into the
Hebrew world-conception because they disbelieved it; or did they merely
ignore it because they were too realistic and would not allow themselves
to be carried away by illusions even of the loftiest kind?

The civilisation of Assyria and Babylon was more brilliant, more
powerful, and more cosmopolitan than the civilisation of Israel.
Nevertheless, there is this important difference between the religious
legends and speculations of these two nations, that while the Assyrian
tablets are polytheistic and mythological, the Hebrew text is

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

monotheistic. The mythological ornaments of the original story have been
chastened and simplified. Without being blind to the poetic beauties of
the original, which in its way is not less venerable than the later
Hebrew version, we must say that the latter is a decided improvement.
Its greater simplicity and freedom from fantastic details gives it a
peculiar soberness and grandeur which is absolutely lacking in the
Assyrian myth of the creation.

While unequivocally recognising the superiority of the Hebrew account,
we must, however, mention in justice to the Assyrian and Babylonian
civilisation that monotheism was by no means an exclusively Jewish
belief. There were monotheistic hymns of great strength and religious
beauty, both in Egypt and in Babylon, long before the existence of the
people of Israel, and it is not impossible that what Sir Henry Rawlinson
calls "the monotheistic party" of Babylon or their brethren in Egypt
were the founders of Jewish monotheism. It is certain that the
philosophers of Egypt and Babylonia were not without influence upon the
development of the Israelitic religion.

Egyptian and Babylonian monotheists apparently suffered the popular
mythology as a symbolical expression of religious truth, while in later
periods the religious leaders of the Jews had no patience with
idolators, and, becoming intolerant of polytheism, succeeded in blotting
out from their sacred literature the popular superstitions of their
times; some vestiges only were left, which are now valuable hints
indicating the nature of the text before it was changed by the hands of
later redactors.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_10"></span>[29:1](hod06.htm#fr_10.md) A popular etymology
connected this word *Adamatu* with *Adamu* or *Admu*, "man," which
later, as Rawlinson pointed out, reappears in the Bible as the name of
the first man. See *The Chaldean Account of Genesis*, by George Smith.
p. 83.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[31:1](hod06.htm#fr_11.md) Sir Henry Rawlinson
believes that Gân Eden or the Garden of Eden is Gan-Duniyas (also called
Gan-Duni), meaning "enclosure," which is a name of Babylonia in Assyrian
inscriptions.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[31:2](hod06.htm#fr_12.md) See Cory's *Ancient
Fragments*, pp. 51-56.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[32:1](hod06.htm#fr_13.md) See George Smith, *The
Chaldean Account of Genesis*, edited by Prof. A. H.

keilinschriftliche Sintfluthbericht*, Leipzig, 1881.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[32:2](hod06.htm#fr_14.md) This is the commonly
adopted form of the name; although the proper transcription is
Gilgamesh. He is also called "Gistubar." The literal meaning of the word
is "mass of fire." See Lenormant's *Histoire Ancienne de l'Orient*, V.,
p. 199.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[32:3](hod06.htm#fr_15.md) Some of the pictures of
the Zodiac are strikingly like those which modern charts employ; for
instance the centaur and the scorpion, which can be seen on an Assyrian
bas-relief in the British Museum reproduced in Lenormant's *Histoire
Ancienne de l'Orient*, V., p. 180.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[36:1](hod06.htm#fr_16.md) It is noteworthy that
*fagus*, the beechtree, and φηγός, the oak, which are both
etymologically identical with the English word *beech* and the German
*Buche*, mean "eating" or "the tree with eatable fruit." The word
*acorn*, which is not derived from oak, but is connected with acre, the
field, means "harvest or fruit"; it has no connexion with the German
*Eichel* (acorn), but it is the same as the German *Ecker*, which is the
name of the beechtree fruit.
