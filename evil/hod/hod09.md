# BRAHMANISM AND HINDUISM.

INDIA, the primitive home of religion and philosophy, exhibits as strong
a tendency for monism as the Persian nation has shown for dualism. But
the ancient monism of India is apt to lose itself in pantism,--a theory
according to which the All alone (or rather the conception of the
absolute as the All) is possessed of reality, while all concrete
existences are considered as a mere sham, an illusion, a dream. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

The polytheism of the popular Hinduism <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) is practically a pantheism in which the
various deities are regarded as aspects of the One and All in which a
discrimination between good and evil is entirely lost sight of. Thus the
struggle between good and evil is contemplated as a process of repeated
God-incarnations made necessary, according to the idea of the Brahmans,
by the appearance of tyranny and injustice, lack of reverence for the
priests, encroachments of the warrior caste

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

on the supremacy of the Brahmans, or some other disorder. While the
enemies of the gods-giants, demons,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

the Brahman gods in their turn are by no means the representatives of
pure goodness. Not only do they frequently assume shapes that to the
taste of any Western nation would be exceedingly ugly and diabolical,
but the same deities who in one aspect are beneficent powers of life,
are in another respect demons of destruction.

Brahm, the highest god of Brahmanism, represents the All, or the
abstract idea of being. He is conceived as a trinity which is called
Trimurti, consisting of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva.

</span>

Brahma, the first-originated of all beings, the lord of all creatures,
the father of all the universes, is the divine mind who is the beginning
of all. He is called *Aja*, the not-born, because he has originated, but
was not begotten.

Brahma originated from *tat*, i. e., undifferentiated being, in which he
existed from eternity in an embryonic form.

Brahma's consort, Sarasvati, also called Brahmi or Brahmini, is the
goddess of poetry, learning, and music.

Brahma is the creator of man. We are told in the Yajurveda that the god
produced from himself the soul, which is accordingly a part of his own
being, and clothed it with a body-a process which is reported in the
reverse

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

order in the Hebrew Genesis, where Elohim creates first the body and
then breathes the life into the body, which makes of man a living soul.

</span>

Brahma is pictured with four heads and four hands, in which he holds a
spoon, a sacrificial basin, a rosary, and the Vedas. One of the four
hands is frequently represented as empty. He sits on a lotus which grows
from Vishnu's navel, representing the spirit that broods over the
waters.

Brahma keeps the first place in the speculations of philosophers, where
he is identified with the life-breath of the world, the Atman or self
that appears in man's soul, but he has not exercised a great influence
on the people. The gods of the people must be less abstract, more
concrete and more human. Thus it is natural that Vishnu, the second
person of the trinity, the deity of avatars or incarnations, is, for all
practical purposes, by far more important than Brahma.

Vishnu appears in the following ten incarnations: <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)

In the first incarnation, called the Matsya-Avatar, Vishnu assumes the
form of a fish in order to recover the Vedas stolen by evil demons and
bidden in the floods of a deluge that covered the whole earth. This
incarnation

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

is of interest because we read in the *Pistis Sophia* (one of the most
important gnostic books) that the books of Ieou, which were dictated by
God to Enoch in paradise, were preserved by Kalapatauroth from
destruction in the deluge." <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md)

In order to enable the gods to procure the immortality-giving drink,
amrita, Vishnu appeared as an immense

Kamadhenu, the cow of plenty; Airavata, Indra's elephant; the tree of
abundance; Chandra, the god of the moon; Sura, the goddess of wine; and,
filially, Dhanvantari, the Indian Æsculapius, who is in possession of
the water of life. The serpent began now to spit venom, which blinded
the demons, while the gods drank the Amrita.

</span>

Varunani, when conceived as goddess of beauty, is called Lakshmi or
Shri; and it is noteworthy that like Aphrodite of the Greeks she
originates from the froth of the ocean.

The third incarnation is the Varâha-avatar, in which Vishnu, in the
shape of a wild boar, kills, with his tusks, the demon Hiranyaksha, who
threatened to destroy the world.

Hiranyaksha's brother, Hiranya-Kasipu, had a son by the name of
Prahlada, who was a pious devotee of

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

Vishnu. The unnatural father tried to kill his son, but the latter
escaped all danger because he did not cease to pray to Vishnu. When
Hiranya-Kasipu expressed a doubt of Vishnu's omnipresence, mockingly
declaring that he could not possibly be in a column to which he pointed,
the wrathful god decided to punish the scoffer. The column rent in
twain, and Vishnu, proceeding from its interior in the shape of a
monster half man half lion, tore Hiranya-Kasipu to pieces. This fourth
incarnation is called the Narasi*n*ha-avatar. Its moral is to impress
upon the people the sad fate of those who do not believe in Vishnu.

Pralada's grandson, Balis, was a pious king, but on that very account
dangerous to the gods, for he was just about to complete the hundredth
grand sacrifice, by which he would have acquired sufficient power to
dethrone Indra. Vishnu came to the assistance of the god of heaven and
appeared before Balis as a dwarf in guise of a Brahman mendicant. Balis
honored him with presents and promised to fulfil his desire, whereupon
the dwarf requested three paces of ground. This was gladly granted under
a rigid oath that would be binding on gods and men. Then the dwarf
assumed a huge shape and stepped with the first pace over the whole
earth, with

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the second over the atmosphere, with the third into the infinity of the
heavens. This is the reason why Vishnu is called Tripadas, or
Trivikramas, the three-paced god. Thus Balis was prevented completing
the hundredth sacrifice, and Indra was again safe on his throne. This
dwarf incarnation is called the Vamana-avatar.

The sixth incarnation, called the Parashura avatar, is historical in its
character, for it reflects the struggles between the warrior-caste and
the Brahmans for supremacy. It is said that Jamadagni, a pious Brahman,
had received from the gods the miraculous cow, Kamadugha (or Surabhi),
which provided him, his wife, Renuka, and their son, Râma, with every
luxury. Karttavirya, a king of the warrior-caste, visits him, and seeing

wealth of the Brahman, tries to take the cow from him, but the cow kills
all who dare to approach her, and rises into heaven, whereupon
Karttavirya in his wrath slays the pious Jamadagni. Râma, the son of the
murdered Brahman, invokes Vishnu's help for the punishment of the wicked
king, and the god not only presents him with a bow and a battle-ax,
which latter is called in Sanskrit *paracus*, the Greek πέλεκυς (hence
the name of this avatar), but also incarnates himself in Râma.
Karttavirya is described as being in possession of a thousand arms,
wielding a thousand weapons, but Râma, endowed with the divine powers of
Vishnu, conquers him after a decisive struggle.

The Râma Chandra avatar has taken a firm hold on the Indian mind, and is
described in the Ramayana, an epic which is the Hindu Odyssey, to the
narrative of which the legend of Râma. bears a great resemblance.

Râma Chandra lived with his wife Sita (frequently regarded as an
incarnation of Lakshmi) and with his half-brother Lakshmana in the
wilderness of the south, where he had withdrawn in order to obey his
father, who had unjustly banished him and appointed Bharata, another son
of his, as heir to the throne. The demon-king, Ravana, waged war against
Râma, and carried off Sita while he and his brother were hunting. It is
impossible to relate here Rama's adventures in detail, how he fought

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

with giants and demons, how the monkey kings, Lugriva and Hanuman,
became his allies, how Hanuman jumped

recovered his faithful wife Sita.

Like the sixth avatar, the Rama Chandra avatar probably contains
historical reminiscences. It also resembles both the Trojan War and the
Gudrun Saga, the epics of Western nations that relate the story of an
abducted wife. The mythical part of all these stories describes the
wanderings of the sun god in search of his consort, the moon.

In his eighth incarnation, the Krishna avatar, Vishnu has reached the
ideal man-god of the Hindus. Kansa, called Kalankura (i. e., crane), the
tyrant of Mathura, receives the prophecy that the eighth son of his
sister, Devaki, will take his throne. He therefore decides to kill all
the children of his sister. Her eighth son, Krishna, however, was an
incarnation of Vishnu, who spoke at once after his birth, comforted his
mother, and gave directions to his father, Vasudeva, how to save him.
Vasudeva carried the infant, protected by the serpent king, over the
river Jamuna, and exchanged him in Gokula for a girl which Yasuda had
just borne to the cowherd Nanda. Kansa seized at once the girl baby, but
before he could kill her she raised herself into the air, explained to
the wrathful king that Krishna had been saved, and disappeared in the
form of lightning. Kansa now decided

to have all the babies in his empire killed, but Krishna escaped again.
A demon nurse was sent to poison him with her venomous milk, but be bit
and killed her, while his stepfather decided to remove to a more distant
country in order to escape the continued hostilities of the king.
Krishna slew the huge serpent, Kali-naga, overcame the giant
Shishoo-polu, killed the monster bird that tried to peck out his eyes,
and also a malignant wild ass. He also burnt the entrails of the
alligator-shaped Peck-Assoort who had devoured him, and choked
Aghi-Assoor, the dragon who attempted to swallow him. When Krishna had
grown to youth he became the favorite of the lasses of Gokula. When he
played the flute every one of the dancing girls believed that the swain
whom she embraced was Krishna himself. He fell in love with the country
girl Radha, the story of which is sung in the Jagadeva's poem,
Gitagovinda. He protected the cowherds against storm and fire, and
finally marched against Kansa, killed him and took possession of his
throne.

Krishna plays also a prominent part in the Mahabharata,

the Kurus, was king of Hastinapur, but being blind, Bhishma, his uncle,

princes, in which the Pandu Arjuna, the skilled bowman and the Hindu
Tell, showed himself superior to all the others, the oldest
Pandu-prince, Yudhishthira, was installed as heir apparent. The Kurus,
however, who managed to remain in power, tried to burn the Pandus, but

promised their cousins to return their share of the kingdom after
thirteen years, if they would live twelve years with Draupadi in the
forest and remain another year in exile; but when this period had
elapsed the Kurus refused to give up the country or any part of

it, and thus the war became unavoidable. Then Duryodhana, the Kuru
prince, and Arjuna, the main hero of the Pandus, called on Krishna for
succor and assistance. Krishna decided not to take an active part in the
fight himself, but left to Arjuna, whom he had seen first, the

After sundry additional adventures the Pandus die and go to heaven,
where they find that rest and happiness which is unattainable on earth.

The Mahabharata, like the Wars of the Roses, shows neither party in a
favorable light; but the epic is written from the standpoint of the
Pandus, whose demeanor is always extolled, while the Kurus are
throughout characterised as extremely unworthy and mean.

Krishna is the Hindu Apollo, Orpheus, and Hercules in one person, and
there is no god in the Hindu Pantheon who is dearer to the Brahman heart
than he. Many

of his adventures, such as his escape from the Hindu Herod, the massacre
of babes, his transfiguration, etc., reappear in a modified form in
Buddhist legends and bear some resemblance to the events told of Christ
in the New Testament.

In his ninth incarnation Vishnu appears as Buddha, the enlightened one,
to be a teacher of morals, of purity, charity, and compassionate love
toward all beings. It is

difficult to state the differences between the Buddha avatar of the
Brahmans and the Buddha of the Buddhists. The latter, there can be no
doubt, was a historical personality, by the name of Gautama, the son of
Shuddhodana of the warrior caste, while the former is a mere ideal
figure of ethical perfection. Burnouf <span

and he is right, but we need not for that reason deny that, on the one
hand, the ideal of a

Buddha avatar was a prominent factor in the formation of Buddhism, while
on the other hand Gautama's teachings have, since the rise of Buddhism,
powerfully affected and considerably modified the Buddha ideal of the
Brahmans. Whatever may be the historical relation between the Hindu
Buddha and the Buddha of the Buddhists, this

much is sure: the Buddha has been received by the Brahmans as one of the
members of the Hindu Pantheon.

The Hindu deity that is nearest in spirit to the Buddha avatar is
Jagannath, the god of love and mercy.

The tenth avatar has not yet been completed. Vishnu is expected to
appear on a winged white horse to reward the virtuous, convert the
sinners, and destroy all evil.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

The horse has one foot raised, and when it places its foot down, the
time of the incarnation will find its fulfilment.

The third person of the Indian trinity is Siva, the Auspicious One,
representing the end of the world and its regeneration. He is commonly
represented by the *linga* as a symbol of the creative faculty and by
the all-devouring fire, the tongued flame of which is pictured in a
triangle turning its point upwards<span id="img_09400"></span>

Sir Monier Monier Williams (in *Brahmanism and Hinduism*, p. 68) says of
this deity, which is "more mystical and less human than the incarnated
Vishnu," that his symbol, the linga, is "never in the mind of a Saiva
(or Siva-worshipper) connected with indecent ideas, nor with sexual
love." The linga, or, as the Romans called it, the phallus, the male
organ of generation, becomes at the first dawn of civilisation, almost
among all the nations of the world, an object of great awe and
reverence. As the symbol of the creative principle it is regarded as the
most essential attribute of both the God-Creator himself and all those
who hold authority in his name. The linga develops in the hand of the
medicine man into a wand, in the hand of the priest into a staff,

and in the hand of the king into a sceptre. The yoni, or female organ,
is regarded as the symbol of Siva's consort, Parvati, and is worshipped
in connexion with the linga by the sect of the Sactis. Perforated rocks
are considered as emblems of the yoni, through which pilgrims pass for
the purpose of being regenerated, a ceremony in which Hindus place great
faith for its sin-expelling significance. (See Charles Coleman, *The
Mythology of The Hindus*, p. 175.)

Siva's consort, Kali, is one of the greatest divinities of India. She is
the goddess of a hundred names, representing not only the power of
nature, but also the ruthless cruelty of nature's laws. She is called
Parvati, the blessed mother, and Durga, which means "hard to go
through," symbolising war and all kinds of danger. She is in the
pantheon of modern Hinduism the central figure; and in spite of the
universality of Brahma in philosophical

The Pantheism which lies at the bottom of the whole Hindu mythology
finds expression in the worship of HariHara, who is a combination of
Vishnu and Siva. In

<span class="small">"There are heretics among men who reject the Vedas
and the Shastras, who live without purificatory ceremonies and
established rules of conduct, and are filled with hatred of Vishnu: so
also there are heretical followers of Vishnu, who are similarly filled
with hatred of Shiva. All these wicked men shall go to hell so long as
this world endures. I will not receive worship from any man who makes a
distinction between Vasudeva and my own divinity: I will divide every
such man in two with my saw. For I have assumed the form of HariHara in
order to destroy the teaching that there is a difference between us: and
he who knows within himself that HariHara is the god of gods, shall
inherit the highest heaven."</span>

HARIHARA. (Reproduced from Wilkins.)

HariHara is depicted as a combination of the two gods in one figure,
which is half male and half female, for according to the Southern
version of the legend Vishnu assumed the form of a beautiful woman who
was embraced so fervently by Siva that both became one.

There are in Hindu mythology innumerable other deities, among whom
Indra, the thunder-god, is the greatest, as the hero among the gods of
secondary rank, reminding us of the Thor of the Norsemen; but Varuna,
the Hindu Kronos, Agni the god of fire, have also at times been very
prominent.

There are in addition gods of third degree, such as

Gandharvas, others at least not naturally ill-intentioned, as for
instance the Apsaras (a kind of Hindu elves), but most of them are
dangerous and demoniacal. Such are the general mischief-makers, the
Asuras, the Pretas, or ghosts, the Bhutas, or spook-spirits, the
baby-killing Grahas, the Rakshasas, who are either giants or vampires,
not to mention all the other demons of less power and importance.

being at variance with the Aryan customs of the age in which the
Mahabharata was versified, <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> Vyasa (the
Homer or "arranger" of the poem, and its supposed author) tries to
explain it allegorically by declaring that Draupadi is Lakshmi, and the
five Pandu brothers represent five different forms of one and the same
Indra.
