# THE INQUISITION.

*Heretics Outlawed*.

THE saddest side of the Devil's history appears in the persecution of
those who were supposed to be adherents of the Devil; namely,
sectarians, heretics, and witches. The most ridiculous accusations were
made and believed of the Manichees, the Montanists, the Novatian
Puritans or Cathari (καϑαροί), the Albigenses, and other dissenters.
They were said to worship the Devil by most obscene ceremonies, and
their intercourse with him was described most minutely as indecent and
outrageous. In times of a general belief in witchcraft and the Devil's
power, nobody was safe against the accusation of being in the service of
Satan. Thus the Stedingers, having effectually resisted the Bishop of
Bremen when he tried to take their tithes from them by force of arms,
were vanquished and cruelly slaughtered after having been denounced as
Devil-worshippers. The order of the Templars, the richest and most
powerful and even the most orthodox order of Christianity, was accused
of the meanest and most bestial idolatry, simply because an avaricious
king of France was anxious to deprive them of their

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

wealth and valuable possessions; and innumerable private citizens, poor
people as a rule recklessly and rich people deliberately, were made in
some way or other victims of this most shameful superstition, sometimes
to benefit ecclesiasticism, sometimes to serve the interests of the
powerful, sometimes out of sheer ignorance, and sometimes even with the
purest and sincerest intentions of doing the right thing for the best of
mankind, and with the pious desire of obeying the word of the Lord,
"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exodus xxii. 18).

The witch-prosecution mania was a general and a common disease of the
age. On the one hand, it cannot (as is often supposed) be attributed to
the influence of the Church alone, and it would, on the other hand, be a
grave mistake to absolve the ecclesiastical institutions of the fearful
crimes of this superstition; for the highest authorities of both
Catholic and Protestant Christianity not only upheld the idea of
witch-prosecution, but enforced it in the execution of the law in all
its most terrible consequences.

It was natural that heretics should always be regarded as belonging to
the same category as witches and wizards, for they, too, were according
to the logic of ecclesiastical reasoning "worshippers of Satan."
Deuteronomy commands that prophets and dreamers of dreams, who by signs
or wonders that come to pass would persuade Israelites to obey other
gods, "shall be put to death" (xiii. 5-11). We read:

<span class="small">"If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son,
or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
thine</span>

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods,
which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;

"Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto
thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the
other end of the earth;

"Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him neither shall
thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal
him:

"But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to
put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

"And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out
of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

"And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
wickedness as this is among you."

Relying on this passage, St. Jerome (340-420 A. D.) did not hesitate to
advise the infliction of capital punishment upon heretics; and Leo the
Great (Pope, 440-461 A. D.) takes the same view. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_169)

Priscillian, a bishop of Spain, a man of learning and pure morals, was
the first heretic who was put to torture and together with some of his
adherents decapitated at Treves in the year 385. The followers of
Priscillian revered the memory of their teacher as that of a martyr, and
formed a sect which continued to exist for a long time in spite of the
excommunication of the Church. Pope Leo the Great justified and praised
the condemnation of Priscillian.

Under Pope Alexander III., the title "Inquisitor," in the sense of judge
in matters of faith, was used for the first time at the council of Tours
(in 1163). The synod

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

of Verona (in 1184) cursed all heretics, and ordered them, in case they
relapsed, to be handed over to the secular authorities for capital
punishment. Pope Innocent III. (1198-1216) for the sake of crushing the
Albigenses gave power to papal emissaries to sue the heretics, and
enjoined all bishops on penalty of deposition to assist in the discovery
and prosecution of unbelievers. Following in the footsteps of Gregory
VII., he vindicated the supremacy of the Church over the State; he
humiliated Philip Augustus of France, deposed Emperor Otto IV.,
compelled John of England to acknowledge the feudal sovereignty of the
Pope and pay tribute. He instigated the fourth crusade (1202-1204) and
exterminated the Albigenses. Under his papacy, at the suggestion of
Castilian Dominic and the Bishop of Toulouse, the new order of
Dominicans was instituted, which was destined to become the working
force of the Inquisition. Pope Gregory IX. pursued the traditional
policy with great vigor, establishing a regular inquisitorial office for
Italy under the name of the "Holy Office," in 1224.

Gregory's policy was codified in an instrument of forty-five articles by
the Council of Toulouse, in 1229, and thus the Inquisition became an
established Church-institution, the appointment and superintendence of
which formed an important prerogative of the Pope. It was not until this
period that the Pope became the absolute ruler of the Church, for now
even bishops could be cited before the papal tribunal of the
Inquisition. Gregory IX. appointed (in 1232) the Dominicans as papal
inquisitors, who performed the terrible duties of their office so
faithfully that they truly earned the title of *Domini canes*,

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the sleuth-hounds
of the Lord," which originated in a word-play on their name.

A famous fresco in the Santa Maria Novella at Florence entitled *Domini
canes*, painted by Simone Memmi, represents the inquisitorial idea under
the allegory of a pack of hounds chasing off the wolves from the
sheepfold.

Gregory IX. (1227-1241) sent Conrad of Marburg to Germany and gave him
unlimited power of citing before his tribunal all people suspected of
witchcraft, commanding him to bring the guilty to the fagot. And this
fiendish man obeyed with joy his master, whom he revered as the Vicar of
Christ on earth. He encountered much opposition, for the people became
rebellious, and even the Archbishops of Cologne, Treves, and Mayence
attempted to resist him. But Conrad remained firm; his practices had the
unequivocal sanction of his Holiness the Pope, and he did not hesitate
to begin proceedings even against these three highest dignitaries of the
Church in Germany. Wherever Conrad appeared, the fagots were lit, and
many innocent people became the victims of his fanaticism. The
Archbishop of Mayence, bent on stopping this fiend, wrote a letter to
the Pope, in which he said:

<span class="small">"Whoever fell into his hands had only the choice
between a ready confession for the sake of saving his life and a denial,
whereupon he was speedily burnt. Every false witness was accepted, but
no just defence granted,--not even to people of prominence. The person
arraigned had to confess that he was a heretic, that he had touched a
toad, that he had kissed a pale man, or some monster. Many Catholics
suffered themselves to be burnt innocently rather than confess to such
vicious crimes, of which they knew they were not guilty. The weak ones,

the least change the course of things.

On the contrary, Rome pursued more vigorously than ever its old policy,
which was at last definitely formulated by Pope Urban V. in his bull
"*In cæna Domini*," proclaimed in 1362, which sounded the slogan against
all who ventured to dissent from Rome, and solemnly condemned heresy in
strong and unequivocal terms.

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

Meanwhile the success of the Inquisition had been greatly imperilled by
the opposition which Conrad of Marburg encountered in Germany. When the
Inquisitor-General indicted Count Henry of Sayn for heresy, he wag cited
before the German Diet that was held in Mayence. The Diet was not
inclined to respect Conrad's authority and passed a vote of censure.
Bent on vengeance for the

do further mischief he was overtaken by several noblemen on the 30th of
July, 1233, near Marburg, on the Lahn, and slain. <span

to his bloody profession. The Germans breathed more freely, but Gregory
IX. canonised him as a saint and martyr, and ordered that a chapel be
built on the spot on which he was killed.

While the establishment of the Holy Office in Germany met with serious
difficulties, the inquisitors were

sixty-five years accused of sexual intercourse with Satan. It is stated
that she had borne a monster with a wolf's head and a serpent's tail,
whose sole food consisted of babies. Under the rule of Charles IV. the
ill-famed Bastile was built, because the prisons no longer sufficed to
hold the indicted heretics.

lull in the witchcraft-prosecution in France, mainly due to the weakness
of the papacy arising from the great schism between Rome and Avignon.
The curses which the two popes mutually visited on their adherents
appeared to change into blessings. The Synod of Langres (1404) speaks of
soothsayers as impostors, and holds out to those who are in the power of
Satan the hope of salvation through repentance and penance. The

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

tribunal of Toulouse (1606) enacted no other punishments upon thirteen
persons than fines, fasts, pilgrimages, and almsgiving, while the
Inquisitor was tried and convicted for the misappropriation of
confiscated property. King Charles VI. ordered that he be deprived of
his salary. <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_173)

of Arras a number of persons before his tribunal and made them confess
on the rack that they had been with the Waldenses; he promised to spare
their lives if they agreed publicly to confess all the abominable crimes
of which the Waldenses had been accused. At a public

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

meeting the accused persons appeared on a scaffold; they wore caps
exhibiting pictures of Devil-worship. The various ceremonies of obscene
demonolatry were read to them, and they were asked whether they were
guilty. All the accused affirmed their guilt, whereupon, in utter
neglect of previous promises, they were sentenced and turned over to the
secular authorities to be burned alive. In vain did they now shout that
they had been cheated, that they knew nothing of the crimes of which
they had been accused, and that they had only confessed because they had
been promised to be let off with a nominal punishment. Broussart was
determined to set an example, and had them executed in 1560 in spite of
the protestations of their innocence.

*The Witch-Hammer*.

Witch-prosecutions received a new impulse in the year 1484 through . the
bull of Pope Innocent VIII., beginning with the words *Summis
desiderantes affectibus*. The inquisitors of Germany, Heinrich
Institoris (whose German name was Krämer) and Jacob Sprenger, complained
of having met with resistance while attending to their duties, and the
Pope afforded them the desired assistance for the sake of strengthening
the Catholic faith <span id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_180)

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

and of preventing the horrible crimes and excesses of witchcraft. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_181)

The bull of Pope Innocent VIII. had reference to Germany only; but other
popes, Alexander VI., Julius II., Leo X., and Hadrian IV., issued bulls
written in the same spirit, instigating the zeal of the inquisitors to
do their best for the purification of the faith and the supression of
witchcraft.

The heinous bull of Pope Innocent VIII. was the immediate cause of the
writing of the *Malleus Maleficarum*, or *Witch-Hammer*, which received
the sanction of the Pope, and a patent from Emperor Maximilian. With the
*Witch-Hammer* in hand, Sprenger and Institoris appeared in 1487 before
the theological faculty of Cologne and demanded their approbation, which
was given with reluctance and after long hesitation. The original form
of the document is very guarded and approves of the principles of
punishing witchcraft only "in so far as they do not contradict the
sacred canons." This did not appear sufficient and the inquisitors
insisted upon a more decisive verdict. There are four further articles
which contain an unequivocal request to the secular authorities to
assist the inquisition in the interest of the Catholic faith.

In addition the inquisitors secured a notary's certificate concerning
the Emperor's patent and the approbation

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

of the theological faculty; but it is noteworthy that the Emperor's
patent is not literally reproduced; nor has it (according to
Soldan's <span id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_182) opinion) ever been
published. The notary declares merely that the Emperor promises to
protect the papal bull and to assist both inquisitors.

Such is the first introduction of the *Witch-Hammer* in Germany, and the
book was at once recognised by zealots as the main source of information
on witchcraft. Damhouder, the great criminalist of the sixteenth
century, esteemed its authority as almost equal to the law; <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_183) and its baneful influence extends over a
period of three centuries.

The *Malleus Maleficarum*, or *Witch-Hammer*, is one of the most famous
and infamous works ever written. Its name indicated that it was intended
to crush witchcraft. No author is mentioned but Sprenger's spirit is
recognised in both its preface (the *Apologia*) and the various chapters
of the book.' Its style is poor, its ideas are foolish, its intentions
are villainous, and the advice given to the inquisitors concerning their
procedure betrays a diabolical perfidiousness. The book contains the
most confounded nonsense, often self-contradictory, and is throughout
irrational and superstitious. The *Witch-Hammer* advises beginning the
trial with the question "whether or not the person on trial believes in
witchcraft." The statement is added: "Mind that witches generally deny
the question." If the culprit denies, the inquisitor continues: "Well,
then, whenever witches are

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

burnt, they are innocently condemned. "A denial of witchcraft sealed the
doom of the accused at once, for the *Witch-Hammer* declares: "The
greatest heresy is not to believe in witchcraft" (*haeresis est maxima
opera maleficarum non credere*). However, if the accused affirmed the
question, the tortures made him confess all that he knew about it and
whether or not he had learned and practised the black art. To plead
ignorance would not avail, for the very refusal of a confession was
counted a crime under the name *maleficium taciturnitatus*. There was no
escape, and the best course for the victim on the rack was to confess
all at once without a relapse into denials, for that at least
abbreviated the procedure and ended the tragedy without its incidental
terrors. As a rule the prisoners of the inquisition ask for death as a
boon and wherever possible commit suicide; for torture made of every one
a hopeless cripple unfit for either work or enjoyment of life, even
though he might be released. Acquittals, however, were rare and the
*Witch-Hammer* advises the inquisitors never to acquit, but only
temporarily to stop proceedings. A *nolle pros* was recommended as the
safer way. The culprit should be handed over to the secular authorities
for capital punishment, especially if the sentence of being burned alive
was mitigated to decapitation, <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_184) a
penalty which the Church avoided inflicting; for "the Church thirsts not
for blood" (*ecclesia non sitit sanguinem*). A confessor and even the
judge himself is advised to speak in private with the prisoner

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

and upon the promise of pardon and mercy to extort a confession. The
*Witch-Hammer* suggests that the judge may say: "'If you confess, I
shall not condemn you to death,' for he may at any time call in another
judge to take his place, who is at liberty to pronounce the sentence."

The victims of the Inquisition were practically without any assistance,
for witchcraft was regarded as an exceptional crime (*crimen
atrocissimum* and *crimen exceptum*) for which the usual rules of
procedure were not binding. It belonged before the secular and also the
ecclesiastical tribunal (*crimen fori mixti*). The culprit must be dealt
with according to the maxim of Pope Boniface VIII. (1294-1303), "simply
and squarely, without the noise and form of lawyers and judges." <span
id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_185)

To us who live in an age of calmer thought and more exact investigation,
it is difficult to understand how the *Witch-Hammer* could ever have
been believed.

*The Torture*.

Witch-prosecution appears to us as rascality pure and simple, but it was
not. It was the result of a firm and deep-seated religious conviction,
as may be learned from the *Malleus Maleficarum*, a work of John
Trithemius, Abbot of the Monastery of Spongheim (1442-1516), who at the
request of Joachim, Markgrave of Brandenburg, investigated the subject,
and after years of conscientious study presented to the world his views
in a

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

book of four volumes, which was completed October 16, in the year 1508,
when the pious abbot had reached the mature age of sixty-six years.

Trithemius distinguishes four classes of wizards and witches: (1) Those
who hurt and kill others through poison and other natural means. (2)
Those who injure others by the art of magic formulas. (3) Those who
converse with the Devil personally. (4) Those who have actually
concluded a contract with the Devil and have thus procured his
assistance for evil designs. Trithemius believes that there is no other
way of protecting the commonwealth against the obnoxious influence of
these malefactors than by extirpating them, but best by burning them
alive. He says:

<span class="small">"It is to be lamented that the number of witches in
all countries is very great, for indeed there is not a village, be it
ever so small, which does not harbor at least one of the third and of
the fourth class. But how rare are the judges who punish these crimes
against God and nature."</span>

And in another passage the abbot utters the complaint:

<span class="small">"Men and animals die through the infamy of these
women, and none considers that it is due to the malignity of witchcraft.
There are many who suffer from serious diseases and do not even know
that they are bewitched."</span>

The great dangers of witchcraft seemed to demand extraordinary means for
combating its evils; and thus the torture, which had formerly been
applied only in exceptional and special cases, began to be developed in
a most formidable and barbaric way.

Suspected persons were subjected to fire and water

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

ordeals, but the latter test was preferred; and this is the reason, as
we read in König's work on the subject:

<span id="img_32700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![THE WATER
ORDEAL.](tn/generic.jpg)

THE WATER ORDEAL.  
</span>

<span class="small">"A case is known in which the accused person
successfully passed through the fire ordeal. It happened immediately
before the appearance of the *Witch-Hammer*. In the archives of
Donau-Eschingen there is a document according to which a certain Anna
Henne from Röthenbach, in the Black Forest, in 1485, cleared herself of
the suspicion of witchcraft by carrying a hot iron."</span>

Concerning the water ordeal the same author says:

<span class="small">"The water ordeal is very old. Ludwig, the Pious,
abolished it, but Hinkmar of Rheims defended its practice. In the times
of Bernhard of Clairvaux, it was used against the Manichees. Pope
Innocent III.</span>

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

<span class="small">again abolished it in the Lateran Council, 1215. The
famous law book, *The Saxon Mirror*, written by Eike von Repkow, in the
year 1230, provides that if two men lay claim to the same thing and the
neighbors can bear no witness, the water-ordeal shall decide."</span>

The *Mirror of the Swabians*, also of the thirteenth century, contains
the same proposition. In the sixteenth century the practice was almost
universally established. As to the underlying idea, König says:

<span class="small">"There are opposite views applied to the ordeal of
water. According to the one, the question was how long the accused could
remain under water; according to the other the innocence of the accused
was proved by sinking, the guilt by swimming. In both cases, the view
prevailed that witches possessed a specific levity, and the rule was
adopted that 'The water refused to receive in its depths those who had
shaken off the baptismal water through a renunciation of their faith.'"
(*Ausgeb. d. Menschenwahns*, pp. 100 ff.)</span>

Who can contemplate without indignation and holy wrath the instruments
of torture used by inquisitors in their infamous vocation? There are
thumbscrews, there are blacksmith's tongs and pincers to tear out the
fingernails or to be used red-hot for pinching; there is the rack,
Spanish boots, collars, chains, etc., there are boards and rollers
covered with sharp spikes; there is the "Scavenger' s Daughter," also
the "Iron Virgin," a hollow instrument the size and figure of a woman,
with knives inside which are so arranged that, when closing, the victim
would be lacerated in its deadly embrace.

Incredible ingenuity was displayed in the invention of these instruments
of torture; and one of the executioner's swords, which still hangs in
the Torturers' Vault at Nuremberg on the left side of the entrance,
exhibits

in bad Latin the blasphemous inscription, "*Solo Deo Gloria*!" <span
id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_186)

The hangmen took pride in their profession and regarded themselves as
disgraced if they could not make their victims confess whatever the
inquisitors wanted. Their usual threat, when a heretic, a wizard, or a
witch was handed over to them, was: "You will be tortured until you are
so thin that the sun will shine through you." The instruments look
horrible enough, but the practice was more horrible than the wildest
imagination can depict.

Before the torture began, the accused were forced to drink the
witch-broth, a disgusting concoction mixed with the ashes of burnt
witches, and supposed to protect the torturers against the evil
influence of witchcraft. The filth <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_187)
of the dungeons was a very effective means of making the prisoner
despondent and preparing him for any confession upon which he could be
condemned. He was frequently secured by iron manacles fixed in the wall
or placed under heavy timbers which prevented the free use of his limbs,
rendering him a helpless prey to rats, mice, and vermin of all sorts.

Consider only the fiendish details of the torture applied to a woman in
the year 1631 on the first day of her trial:  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_188)

<span class="small">"(1) The hangman binds the woman, who was pregnant,
and places her on the rack. Then he racked her till her heart would
fain</span>

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="small">break, but had no compassion. (2) When she did not
confess, the torture was repeated, the hangman tied her hands, cut off
her hair, poured brandy over her head and burned it. (3) He placed
sulphur in her armpits and burned it. (4) Her hands were tied behind
her, and she was hauled up to the ceiling and suddenly dropped down. (5)
This hauling up and dropping down was repeated for some hours, until the
hangman and his helpers went to dinner. (6) When they returned, the
master-hangman tied her feet and hands upon her back; brandy was poured
on her back and burned. (8) Then heavy weights were placed on her back
and she was pulled up. (9) After this she was again stretched on the
rack. (10) A spiked board is placed on her back, and she is again hauled
up to the ceiling. (11) The master again ties her feet and hangs on them
a block of fifty pounds, which makes her think that her heart will
burst. (12) This proved insufficient; therefore the master unties her
feet and fixes her legs in a vise, tightening the jaws until the blood
oozes out at the toes. (13) Nor was this sufficient; therefore she was
stretched and pinched again in various ways. (14) Now the hangman of
Dreissigacker began the third grade of torture. When he placed her on
the bench and put the I shirt' on her, he said: 'I do not take you for
one, two, three, not for eight days, nor for a few weeks, but for half a
year or a year, for your whole life, until you confess: and if you will
not confess, I shall torture you to death, and you shall be burned after
all. (15) The hangman's son-in-law hauled her up to the ceiling by her
hands. (16) The hangman of Dreissigacker whipped her with a horsewhip.
(17) She was placed in a vise where she remained for six hours. (18)
After that she was again mercilessly horsewhipped. This was all that was
done on the first day."</span>

This is not barbarous, this is not bestial, it is satanic. And such
deeds could be done in the name of God, for the sake of the religion of
Jesus, and by the command of the highest authorities of the Christian
Church!

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

From the great number of prosecutions for witchcraft we select one
instance only, which, however, is neither typical nor extraordinary in
its horrors.

We read in Konig's popular exposition of human superstitions, <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_189) p. 240:

"There was a farmer by the name of Veit, living in a village of Southern
Bohemia. He was famous for his wit and unusual humor. At the same time
he was physically strong, and whenever there was a quarrel at the inn he
came off victor. The rumor spread that he was inviolable, as sometimes
hunters are supposed to be bullet-proof, and Veit never denied it. By
and by he was regarded as a wizard, and as his cattle prospered best and
his fields yielded the richest crops, he was soon supposed to be in
league with the Evil One. Now it happened that the village was troubled
with mice, and Veit was suspected of having caused the plague. When
questioned about it, he granted in a moment of humor that he had sent
the mice but would soon drive them away again, and he promised to prove
at the next church-fair that he could actually make mice. When the day
appointed came, the inn was overcrowded, and farmer Veit appeared with a
big bag under his arm, into which he requested the company to throw
twenty pebbles. They did so without noticing that the bag was double.
And while one part was empty the other contained twenty mice. When the
pebbles were put in the bag, [Veit](errata.htm#3) murmured a magic
formula and let the mice loose in the presence of his frightened
audience.

"This performance, however, had unexpected and tragic results. The
people were convinced that it was the work of hell, and Veit escaped
with difficulty from the inn. Veit was arrested the next night and
delivered to the criminal court. A mole on his body was thought to be a
stigma of the Devil, and all the witnesses agreed that he was a genuine
wizard. His case was thoroughly investigated, and even the University of
Prague was consulted; the verdict signed by the Rector Magnificus with
his own hand was

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="small">against him, and Veit, who stoutly maintained his
innocence, had to endure all the tortures of the inquisition. At last he
was burned alive and the ashes of his body were thrown to the winds. We
read in the records of the law-suit that Veit mounted the stake 'without
showing repentance or doing penance.' And when chains were put on his
neck, around his body, and around his feet, he cried with a loud voice,
'My God, I die innocently.' judges, professors, physicians, and
theologians agreed unanimously in the conviction of this innocent
man."</span>

Volumes might be filled with accounts of the many thousand various
instances of witch-prosecutions, and every single case is so
soul-harrowing that we prefer to pass them by in silence. The
accusations are almost always very circumstantial and definite, mostly
of brutal indecency and ridiculously impossible.

*The Angel of Augsburg*.

Witch-prosecution was a convenient weapon in the bands of unscrupulous
men for accomplishing crooked ends or satisfying some private vengeance.
One of the most tragic and pathetic cases is the sad death of Agnes
Bernauer, a beautiful woman, the daughter of a barber and the sweetheart
of Albrecht, Duke of Bavaria.

Agnes was born about 1410 in Biberach, and it appears that she was a
mere servant girl in Augsburg at the time Duke Albrecht of Würtemberg,
the son of Duke Ernest, made her acquaintance. The story that Agnes was
of patrician birth and that the lovers met at the great tournament is
mere legend, but this much is sure that Agnes was extraordinarily
beautiful, with golden hair, and delicate, noble features. Even her
enemies could not help praising the nobility of her appearance. We

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

know little or nothing about the relations between Duke Albrecht and
Agnes, except that he courted her and took her with him to his residence
in the County Vohnburg.

Duke Ernest, Albrecht's father, knew about Agnes's presence at Vohnburg
but he cared little, until he became anxious about having a legal heir
to his duchy. Then he requested his soil to marry the daughter of Duke
Erik of Brunswick, but Albrecht refused on account of the love he bore
to Agnes.

When persuasion appeared to be without avail, Duke Ernest thought of
other means to separate his son from the lowly-born maiden. At a public
tournament, he ordered the judges to refuse admittance to Albrecht on
the ground that for the sake of a concubine he neglected his filial
duties. Albrecht was greatly exasperated and as soon as he returned to
Vohnburg he recognised Agnes as his wife. With the consent of his uncle,
Duke William, he moved to the castle Straubing, which he donated to her
and surrounding her with a ducal court, called her henceforth Duchess
Agnes.

The poor woman did not enjoy the splendor of the court. She feared the
wrath of the old Duke, and built, in a melancholy presentiment of her
sad fate, her own burial chapel, in the monastery of the Carmelites at
Straubing. Her happiness was of short duration.

In Albrecht's absence, Duke Ernest seized Agnes, had her imprisoned and
denounced her as a witch. Her condemnation had been decided upon before
the trial began, and the verdict pronounced her guilty of having
bewitched Duke Albrecht and thus committed a criminal offence against
Duke Ernest. The judgment ordered her

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

to be drowned in the river, and Duke Ernest signed the verdict.

The hangmen carried the young woman to the bridge at Straubing and
thrust her, in the presence of a multitude

of spectators, into the water. But the current drifted her ashore and
she held up her white arms appealing to

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

the people for help. The people were moved and she might have been
saved, had not one of the hangmen, fearing the wrath of the old duke,
seized a pole and catching her long golden hair held her under water
until she expired. This happened in the year 1435.

She was buried in St. Peter's cemetery of Straubing.

When the young Duke on his return was informed of the terrible death of
his beloved Agnes he swore vengeance, and in alliance with his cousin
Duke Ludwig of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, began to wage a vigorous war against
his own father. Through the mediation of the Emperor, however, he was
reconciled with his father at the council of Basel.

Duke Ernest built a chapel over the grave of his innocent victim and had
an annual mass read over her for the welfare of her soul. Duke Albrecht
thereupon agreed to marry Anna, Princess of Brunswick, by whom he had
ten children, although it cannot be said that his married life was a
happy one.

In 1447 Duke Albrecht had the body of Agnes transferred to the chapel
which she had built for herself in the Carmelite monastery; and he had
the resting-place of her remains adorned with a beautiful marble image
of her in full figure with the simple inscription:

"Obiit Agnes Bernauerin. Requiescat in pace."

Poets who have immortalised her name, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_190) and the

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

people of Bavaria among whom her memory is still cherished, call her
"the angel of Augsburg."

\*      <sup>\*</sup>      \*

One of the most comical witch-prosecutions took place in 1474 against a
diabolical rooster who had been so presumptuous as to lay an egg. The
poor creature was solemnly tried, whereupon he was condemned to die at
the stake and publicly burned by order of the authorities of the good
city of Basel.

We abstain from entering further into the details of the prosecution of
witches, which gradually developed into a systematic business involving
great emoluments to judges, torturers, hangmen, inquisitors, denouncers,
witnesses, and all persons connected with the process. It is a doleful
work to go over the mere statistics of the *autos-da-fé*, and every
single story of a trial for witchcraft cannot but rouse our deepest
indignation; and even now the belief in witchcraft is not yet extinct
among the so-called civilised races of mankind.
