# THE ABOLITION OF WITCH-PROSECUTION.

*Molitor and Erasmus*.

THE horrors of Devil worship, of the Inquisition, and of
witch-prosecution were the natural consequences of a misconception of
the nature of evil. They were the visitations that necessarily followed
in the footsteps of a most abandoned ignorance. They oppressed mankind
like a dreadful nightmare, like ghastly hallucinations of a feverish
brain, and the disease passed away slowly, very slowly, only when the
light of science, which is the divine revelation that is taking place
now, gradually began to dispel the gloomy shadows of the night and
revealed the superstitious character of the belief that had begotten the
crimes of the dark ages.

The first protests against witch-prosecution were raised at the time
when the two inquisitors Sprenger and Institutoris, fortified with the
unequivocal authority of his Holiness the Pope, carried on their
criminal profession in the boldest way. The outrages of the Inquisition
were pointed out in a pamphlet entitled *Dialogus de lamiis et
pythonibus mulieribus*, written in 1489 by Dr. Ulrich Molitoris, an
attorney of Constance. Two other

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

prominent men of the juridical profession, Alciatus and Ponzinibius,
expressed themselves in the same spirit; they declared bodily excursions
of witches and similar things to be pure imagination. But their
arguments

were of no avail, for Bartholomæus de Spina, the master of the holy
palace, declared that jurists could not understand the case of
witchcraft.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

The time was not yet ripe; the people still clung to the belief in
visions and miracles, dreams, apparitions and sorcery. Most insane
productions (such as, e. g., Grünbeck's *New Interpretation of Strange
Miracles*, which appeared in the year 1507) attracted the attention of
the world and passed for divine revelations. The more uncanny they were,
the higher was the credit they received. <span

There is a remarkable instance on record that the hangman of Vienna
refused to perform his office on Oct. 21, 1498. The execution had to be
delayed until another hangman could be procured. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_208.md) Another case is mentioned by
Soldan. <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_209.md) Katharine Hensel of
Feckelberg was sentenced to die in June, 1576, but when at the place of
execution she pleaded her innocence, the hangman refused to execute her.
The case was referred to the Palsgrave George John of Veldenz who after
a careful examination of the trial ordered an acquittal and condemned
the township Feckelberg to bear the costs. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_210.md)

The famous Erasmus of Rotterdam published a letter in the year 1500 in
which be spoke of devil-contracts as an invention made by the
witch-prosecutors; but his satire had no effect; for, in the meantime,
fagots were constantly burning all over Europe.

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

*Weier, Meyfart, and Loos*.

The first successful attempt--successful only temporarily and in a
limited degree--of stopping witch-prosecution came from a Protestant
physician, Johannes Weier (Latin "Wierus" or "Piscinarius") . He was
born in Grave, 1515, had studied medicine in Paris, and travelled in
Africa, where, as he tells us, he had had a good opportunity of studying
sorcery. Then he went to Crete, and on his return was elected
body-physician to Duke William of Cleves. His work of six books, *De
prætigiis Dæmonum et incantationibus ac Veneficiis*, appeared in 1563.
He still believes in the Devil and in magic, but he rejects the
possibility of witchcraft and compacts with the Devil. He boldly accuses
monks and clergymen of being, under the pretext of serving religion,
most zealous servants of Beelzebub. William, Duke of Cleves, Frederic,
Count of Palatine, and the Count of Niurwenar followed Weier's advice
and suppressed all witch-prosecution.

Twenty years after Weier another heroic man, a Protestant, named
Meyfart, rector of the Latin school of Coburg, raised his voice of
warning. His booklet was a sermon of "Admonitions to the powerful
princes and the conscientious preachers," by which words he meant the
Dominican fathers who were the official witch-prosecutors. He reminded
them of the day of judgment, when they would be held to account for
every torture and tear of their victims.

Weier and Meyfart made a deep impression. But a

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

reaction followed. How little, after all, Weier succeeded in conquering
the belief in witchcraft, which he had temporarily shaken, can be
learned from the fact that in the Protestant Electorate of Saxony a
criminal ordinance was issued in the year 1572, which threatened all
people making a compact with the Devil "to be brought from life to death
on the fagot."

Cornelius Loos, a canonicus and professor at the University of Treves
and a devout Catholic Christian, was unfortunate enough to be more
clear-headed than his bishop, Peter Binsfeld. Recognising the baseness
of judges in the cases of witchcraft, he wrote a book *De vera et falsa
magia*. The book was never published; it was stopped in the press and
its author sent to prison. In 1593 Loos was forced to recant on his
knees before the assembled dignitaries of the Church. He died in 1595 of
the plague, which probably saved him from an execution at the stake.
Loos's manuscript was supposed to be lost but was recently discovered by
Prof. George Lincoln Burr of Cornell University. <span
id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_211.md)

*Three Noble Jesuits*.

Adam Tanner <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_212) (1572-1632.md) and Paul
Laymann (1575-1635), two Jesuits of South Germany, strongly advised the
judges to be very careful in lawsuits against witches. When death
overtook Tanner on a journey, in a little place called Unken, the
parishioners refused to grant him a Christian burial, because a "hairy
little

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

imp" on a glass plate was found among his things. It was an insect
prepared for the microscope. <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) The
curate of Unken, however, succeeded in convincing his congregation of
the harmless nature of the "imp," and they at last consented to the
interment in their cemetery.

Most touching is the narrative of another Jesuit, a noble-minded man,
who takes a prominent place among the strugglers against the dreary
superstition of burning witches. This man is Friedrich Spee von
Langenfeld (1591-1635), a poet and the author of a collection of songs
called *Trutznachtigall* (spite-nightingale), whose warnings remained
unheeded, "as a voice crying in the wilderness." His *Cautio criminalis*
(published anonymously <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_214) in 1631.md)
was an appeal, much needed at the time, to the German authorities anent
their legal proceedings against witches.

Spee was engaged in Franconia as pastor, and had prepared for their
death at the stake not fewer than two hundred persons accused of
witchcraft. Scarcely thirty years of age, he was asked one day by Philip
of Schoenborn, Bishop of Würzburg, why his hair had turned gray.
"Through grief," he said. "Of the many witches whom I have prepared for
death, not one was guilty." The reply must have burnt into the soul of
the questioner, for ever after Philip of Schoenborn remained under its
influence. Spee confessed to the Bishop that he was the author of the
*Cautio criminalis*, and the Bishop did not betray the confidence of the
young Jesuit.

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

Says Spee in his *Cautio criminalis*:

<span class="small">"In these proceedings no one is allowed to have
legal assistance or defence, however honestly it may be conducted. For
it is claimed that the crime is a *crimen exceptum*, one not subject to
the rules of ordinary legal proceedings. And even if an attorney
were</span>

<span class="small">allowed to the prisoner, the former would from the
outset be suspected himself, as a patron and protector of witches, so
that all mouths are shut and all pens are blunted, and one can neither
speak nor write. . . . I swear solemnly that of the many persons whom I
accompanied to the stake, there was not one who could be</span>

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="small">said to have been duly convicted; and two other
pastors made me the same confession from their experience. Treat the
heads of the Church, the judges, myself, in the same way as those
unfortunate ones, make us undergo the same tortures, and you will
convict us all as wizards."</span>

Spee did not deny the possibility of witchcraft; he was a faithful
believer in the dogmas held by the Church of his age. He merely objected
to the abuses of witchcraft and recommended clemency.

Philip of Schoenborn became Archbishop of Mayence and to his honor be it
said that under his government no fagots were lit.

*Abatement of Witch-Prosecution*.

Horst (in his *Zauberbibliothek*, Vi., 310) publishes a strange instance
of the fanaticism of the seventeenth century which appeared anonymously
under the title *Druten-Zeitung*, in 1627, praising in poor verses the
great deeds of the Inquisition. According to Horst's authority, they are
written by a Protestant who expresses his joy and gratitude to God that
in the adjoining Catholic countries the extirpation of witchcraft was
carried on with unabating vigor. Thus it is apparent that in spite of
Weier and Spee the idea of witchcraft and of the necessity of
witch-prosecution was still deeply rooted in the minds of many people.
Still, the authorities began to lose faith in the necessity of
witch-prosecution, and the champions of the lost cause deem it wiser to
seek the shelter of anonymous publication.

In Holland witch-prosecution was abolished in 1610; in Geneva,
Switzerland, it ceased in 1632.

Christina, Queen of Sweden., as the first act after her accession to the
throne, issued a proclamation on February 16, 1649, which applied also
to all the Swedish possessions on German soil, to stop all proceedings
of witch-prosecution. Gabriel Naudé, a Frenchman (he died 1680) wrote
against witch-prosecution, and, although the Parliament of France which
convened at Rouen insisted on the existence of witchcraft and on the
necessity of the capital punishment of witches, Louis XIV. decreed in
1672 that all cases of witchcraft be dismissed. He was obliged to
re-introduce the law of capital punishment of witches in 1683, but did
not fail to limit the power of the judges.

Matthias Hopkins, commonly called "witchfinder general," took advantage
of the disorders of the English civil wars of the seventeenth century
and made a special business of the discovery of witches. He was quite
successful, until his own methods were tried on his own person, and as
he did not sink in the water ordeal, the people declared him to be a
wizard and slew him (1647). <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_215.md) Butler
describes Hopkins's career in Hudibras as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hath not this present Parliament  
A lieger to the devil sent,  
Fully empower'd to treat about  
Finding revolted witches out?  
And has he not within a year  
Hang'd threescore of them in one shire?  
Some only for not being drown'd,  
And some for sitting above ground  
Whole days and nights upon their breeches,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">And feeling pain, were hang'd for witches.  
And some for putting knavish tricks  
Upon green geese or turkey chicks  
Or pigs that suddenly deceased  
Of griefs unnatural, as he guess'd,  
Who proved himself at length a witch  
And made a rod for his own breech."</span>

</div>

Witch-prosecution was finally abolished in England in the year 1682.
Glanville, a fanatic Englishman of Somerset, felt himself called upon to
refute the writings of Gabriel Naudé and found many followers, but Dr.
Webster, a physician, stood up against Glanville's superstitions
propositions. Glanville thereupon proceeded to hunt witches, but the
English government ordered Mr. Hunt, a justice of the peace of Somerset,
to stop him.

At the end of the seventeenth century the polemics against the belief in
the Devil began to grow bolder and ever bolder. A Dutch physician, Anton
van Dale, no longer attributes the pagan oracles to the influence of the
Devil, but to priestly fraud (*De oraculis Ethnicorum*, Amsterdam,
1685), and set the people to thinking on witch-prosecution (see his work
*Dissertationes de origine ac progressu Idolalriæ*, etc., 1696). He thus
prepared

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

the way for the two great reformers Bekker and Thomasius, who openly and
squarely denounced witchcraft as a superstition and at last succeeded in
abolishing the official prosecutions of witches by the authorities of
State and Church.

Balthasar Bekker, a Dutch clergyman of German

descent, published in 1691-1693 a work entitled "The Enchanted World"
(*De betoverde Weereld*), which was a thorough and careful examination
of the belief in devils, witches, and the legal suits conducted against
witches. Bekker is a faithful Christian who undertakes to prove that the
existence of a personal Devil is a superfluous assumption.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His book is a
formidable attack upon the Inquisition and its habits of ensnaring its
innocent victims.

</span>

And the success of the book was as great as it was deserved. Within two
months four thousand copies were

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

sold. And yet did Bekker fail to convince his contemporaries. A flood of
refutations appeared, and the synod to whom he presented his work, a
Protestant body, condemned his views and discharged him from the
ministry.

The seeds sown by Bekker were reaped by Christian Thomasius (1656-1718),
professor at the University of Halle, who waged a relentless war against
witch-prosecution. In the year 1698 a case of witchcraft was submitted
to him and against the advice of one of his colleagues he condemned a
poor woman to death. However, when the judgment had been executed, the
arguments of his opponent gained on him until he became convinced of his
own error; and now he deemed it his duty to devote the

</span>

whole influence of his authority to the abolition of witch-prosecution.
He came out boldly and squarely in condemnation of the practice and
denied the bodily corporeality of the Devil, which served him as an
argument to disprove the possibility of making a compact with him. His
main writings are *Dissertatio de crimine magiæ* and *De origine et
progressu processus inquisitoriii contra sagas*.

Thomasius was more successful than his predecessors. All official
witch-prosecutions ceased, and the Devil was no longer an object of
universal awe.

*The Last Traces*.

The Inquisition was still in existence during the first quarter of the
nineteenth century in Spain, a country distinguished

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

by its ultra-Roman conception of Christianity. When in 1808, after the
battle of Ramosiera, the French troops under General La Salle conquered
Toledo, they opened the dungeons of the Inquisition. The cells were dark
and unclean holes, scarcely large enough to allow a man to stand
upright, and most of the prisoners that were brought up to daylight had
become stiff and crippled by the maltreatment of their torturers.
Unhappily they and their liberators, a detached troop of lancers, were
cut off by a furious mob of Spaniards from the main body of the French
army. General La Salle hurried to their rescue but came too late; he
found only the mangled bodies of the slaughtered.

In a subterranean vault General La Salle found a wooden statue of the
holy virgin dressed in silk, her head surrounded with a golden halo, her
right hand holding the standard of the Inquisition. She was fair to look
at, but her breast was covered with spiked armor; and her arms and hands
were movable by machinery concealed behind the statue. The servants of
the Inquisition explained to General La Salle that it was used for
bringing heretics to confession. The delinquent received the sacrament
at the altar in the presence of the dimly illumined statue, and was once
more requested to confess. Then two priests led him to the statue of the
*Madre dolorosa* which miraculously seemed to welcome him by extending
her arms. "She beckons you to her bosom," they said; "in her arms the
most obdurate sinner will confess," whereupon the arms closed, pressing
their victim upon the spikes and knives.

Napoleon I. suppressed the Inquisition (in Spain

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

December 4, 1808, and in Rome one year later), but it was revived by
Ferdinand VII., King of Spain, June 21, 1813. Its last victims were a
Jew who was burned, and a Quaker school-master who was hanged in 1826.

*Descriptions of Hell*.

The Jesuit Father, Caussin, the father confessor of King Louis XIII.
writes on hell in his book, *La Cour Sainte*,--a work which attained
considerable fame in his days, as follows:

<span id="img_38500"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![SCHOTTEL'S WHEEL
OF HELL.](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/38500.jpg.md)  
SCHOTTEL'S WHEEL OF HELL.  
</span>

<span class="small">"What is hell? A silence for all that which is said
of hell is less than hell itself. No just man can think of it without
shedding thousands of tears. But do you want to know what hell is? Ask
Tertullian. He will tell you that hell is a deep, dark pit of stench in
which all the offal of the whole world flows together. Ask Hugo of St.
Victor. He will answer: 'Hell is an abyss without a bottom, which opens
the gates of despair, and where all hope is abandoned.' 'It is an
eternal pool of fire,' says St. John the divine (Rev. xiv. 20); 'its air
comes from glowing coals, its light from flickering flames. The nights
of hell are darkness; the places of rest of the damned are serpents and
vipers; their hope is despair. O, eternal death! O, life without life!
O, misery without end!'"</span>

Justus Georg Schottel, <span id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) whilom
member of the Consistory of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and councillor to the

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

duke, doctor of jurisprudence, and a learned man who was not without
merit in German poetry and literature, took special interest in the
mysteries of the infernal regions, and published his views in a book of
328 pages, in which he explained the tortures of the iron wheel of
eternal hell torture:

<span class="small">"Dear reader," he says, look at this wheel all round
and read carefully what is written on it. How much time and suffering,
how much anxiety and torture of despair, must be gone through in hell,
must be endured, borne, experienced and realised, by hundreds, by
thousands, by hundreds of thousands, by millions of years in burning
pitch, in flaming sulphur, in red-hot iron, in poignant blow-pipe
flames, with weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth infinite; with
hunger and thirst miraculous; in stench and darkness cruelly; before
this wheel be turned around only once. But now this wheel of eternity is
made of purely everlasting iron, and must turn round many hundred, yea
million, and millions of millions of times, and can never wax old, never
perish, never be worn out, and can never stand still in all eternity.
Whereas you can conclude and find out by reflexion this
all-discomforting, all-terrible, and all-cruelest infinity of
hell-torture. One might grow mad and insane when considering this fiery
eternity and these iron eternal years, etc., etc."</span>

Dr. Schottel's Wheel of Life is of special interest as it reminds one of
the Buddhist Wheel of Life which the Evil Spirit holds in his
clutches. <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_218.md)

Similar ideas as to the awfulness of the sufferings in hell are offered
in the sermons of Abraham a Sancta-Clara who was the most influential
preacher in Vienna in the beginning of the eighteenth century.

The eighteenth century is the age of an intellectual

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

dawn, but while the rays of light begin to spread the shadows of the
night linger and their darkness seems rather more intense than before.

The Rev. Father Gilbert Baur, writes in the year 1785 as follows:

<span class="small">"You know what happens when meat is salted. The salt
enters all parts, every nerve and every bone, and communicates to all
parts its acrid qualities; and yet the meat is not dissolved nor
annihilated by the salt, but on the contrary preserved from decay. In
the same way the hellish fire will enter into the innermost marrow, and
be distributed throughout the entrails. It will take hold of all the
arteries and nerves and make the brain boil with furious pains, without
causing death or annihilation."</span>

Some theological geographers have placed hell in the sun, others in the
moon, still others in the center of the earth. But the question as to
which of the three opinions is right has not yet been decided.

A Slavonian folk song sings of hell as follows: <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_219.md)

"Look at the terrible maw! How fiery and deep is the place of torture!
No eye can discover its bottom.

"A spark alone causes immense pain, but against the fury of this fire it
is but a dewdrop.

"Reason cannot comprehend and tongue cannot utter what it may be to be
in the fires of Hell.

"Devils transform themselves into dogs, into wild animals, into snakes
and dragons; they howl, and they bellow, and they bawl; what terrors
they cause 1

"Every poor sinner must pay tribute here to the justice of God; and for
every vicious deed he must suffer special pain."

After an enumeration of the sufferings for various sins and vices, the
poem continues:

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

</span>

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

"Can there be worse misery? Indeed, there is not; for from this place of
darkness the eye of the damned will never see the face of God.

"'Woe, woe!' thus they howl; Whither have we gone, we miserable
creatures? Oh! that men would believe us; they would never fall into
sin.'

"'Death, where art thou? O thunder-holts, slay us! O, God, we want to
die, for we cannot endure these pains!'

"Alas! In vain you wish for death, ye souls lost in eternity. You are
damned to live, eternally dying.

"Even a toothache you could not endure forever. How much more terrible
must be the fire everlasting!

"Consider then. O sinner, the misery that awaits you. Who knows whether
you may not reach your destiny to-morrow?

"To-night you go to bed in your sin, and to-morrow you may wake up
burning in the fires of Hell."

These descriptions of hell are, in all their essential features, still
current in "darkest Europe" and also in "darkest America." The picture
of hell, here reproduced, surpasses in drastic beauty and graudeur of
stage-effect the paintings of the famous Hell Breughel. It possesses the
additional interest of being still in the market, being even now
advertised and sold among other religious pictures.

No wonder that there are good Christians who would gladly change places
with brute animals. A young Jesuit who afterwards turned
[Protestant](errata.htm#4.md) said in his memoirs that he used to envy the
watch dog in the courtyard to whom death meant annihilation without the
terrors of hell.

There is a good deal of moral courage in the comfort which, as the story
goes, an old infidel farmer gave to

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

his dying son, saying: "We do not go to church, and the parson hates us;
now, when you die you will go to hell; but don't shame our family by
howling and gnashing of teeth. What others can stand we can stand too."
Must not the Lord have been better pleased with infidel grit than with
the submissiveness of the slavish believer?

*Schwenter and Kircher*.

The Jesuit order carries the principle of Romanism and obedience to
church-authorities to extremes. It was founded for the purpose of
creating and sustaining a counter-reformation to Protestantism, and to
Protestants therefore it is the most objectionable Roman Catholic order.
But whatever may be said against the Jesuits, their methods and narrow
principles, we must acknowledge that some of their members have been
very prominent and scholarly men; and Athanasius Kircher is one of the
greatest scientists they have produced. Born at Geisa, near Fulda,
Germany, in 1601, he was professor of philosophy and mathematics at the
University of Würzburg, which he left during the Thirty Years' War, for
Avignon, in France. He journeyed with Cardinal Frederick of Saxony to
Malta, and ended his life as professor of mathematics and Hebrew at
Rome. His investigations have no direct, but only an indirect, bearing
on witchcraft-prosecutions. He made some curious experiments with hens
and pigeons, which remained a problem to psychologists, and are still
repeated by them to-day. He placed a hen on the floor, and made a stroke
of chalk along its bill, whereupon the hen lay quiet as if paralysed,
remaining in this awkward position until she was

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

released by some motion of the hands of the experimenter.

We ought to add here that although Kircher is generally credited with
the invention of this experiment because it became known mainly through
him. <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) Professor Preyer has proved
that he simply reproduced the experiment made by Daniel Schwenter, <span

ten years before the appearance of Kircher's *Ars Magna Lucis et Umbræ*.

The attitude of the hen, which Kircher ascribes to her imagination, was
later, in the eighteenth century, called a phenomenon of magnetism or
mesmerism, and in the nineteenth century, hypnotism. Whatever scientific

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

value this isolated fact may possess, its discovery marked the beginning
of a scientific treatment of psychical phenomena which naturally tended
to a better comprehension of the abnormal conditions of the human mind,
and thus could not but exercise a wholesome influence.

*Diabolism Developing Into Pathology*.

In the middle of the eighteenth century Pater John Joseph Gassner, vicar
of Klösterle in Chur, a Roman Catholic clergyman, acted on the theory
that the majority of diseases arose from demoniacal possession and he
cured himself and his parishioners by exorcism. The success of his cures
made a great stir in the world and threatened a dangerous reaction. Some
declared he was a charlatan, while others believed in him.

Mesmer, at the request of the Elector of Bavaria, made investigations
and said that he explained his miracles as spiritualistic magnetic
influences, while Lavater maintained that the curative element consisted
solely in the glorious name of Jesus. Gassner lived some time in
Constance, afterwards in Ratisbon, partly protected,

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

partly distrusted by his ecclesiastical superiors. In 1775 he went to
Amberg, then to Sulzbach, where the halo of his miraculous cures waned.
The Prince-Bishop of Ratisbon declared in his favor, but Emperor Joseph
II. forbade his exorcisms in the whole Roman empire. The Archbishops of
Prague and Salzburg rejected him, and even Pope Pius VI. disapproved of
him.

Gassner's exorcisms renewed the interest taken in the problem of the
existence of the Devil. The question was discussed in several
publications, among which we mention "a humble petition for information
to the great men who do no longer believe in a Devil," written
anonymously from the orthodox standpoint by Professor Köster, of
Giessen, editor of a religious periodical. It was answered in another
pamphlet: "Humble reply of a country-clergyman," whose author claims
that the biblical Satan is an allegory, idols are called "nothings" in
Hebrew, and the Devil is one of these nothings. He offers rationalistic
explanations of the Bible, representing, for instance, the tempter of
Christ as "a sly messenger and spy of the synagogue," and declaring the
theory of a Devil to be idolatry disguised in orthodoxy, and a
sublimated Manicheeism. The author concludes: "I had rather that the
people fear God than the Devil. The fear of God is the be, ginning of
wisdom, but the fear of the Devil, whatever be its results, is no
Christian adornment. "

The number of anti-diabolists increased rapidly, even among the clergy;
yet the belief in a personal Devil remained the orthodox view, and if we
are not mistaken it is still regarded as an essential dogma of the
Christian

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

faith by many theologians, especially among those who display a contempt
for worldly culture and secular science.

The worst superstitions had grown harmless, but the hankering after
miracles had not yet ceased. Diabolism had lost its hold on mankind, but
mysticism reappeared in new forms; and the contrasts that prevailed in
the eighteenth century cannot be better characterised than by the
visions of Swedenborg as against the refutation of the dreams of
visionaries by Kant.

The belief in mysticism begets frauds; and the boldest, wiliest, and
most successful imposter of the eighteenth century was Giuseppe Balsamo
of Sicily, who travelled under the assumed name of Count Cagliostro,
finding easy victims among the credulous of all descriptions, especially
the Free Masons. His tricks, however, were exposed by Countess Elizabeth
von der Recke, and being thereafter exiled from every country which he
entered, he fell at last into the hands of the Inquisition, as whose
prisoner he died in the year 1795.

*Demonology of the Nineteenth Century*.

The free-thought movement of the eighteenth century and a better
scientific conception of nature relieved mankind of the unnecessary fear
of the Devil, and the nineteenth century could begin to study the
question impartially in its historical and philosophical foundations.

Kant found the principle of evil in the reversal of the moral
world-order. "The Scriptures lay down," he says, "man's moral relation
in the form of a history, representing the opposite principles in man as
eternal facts, as heaven and hell. The significance of this popular

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

conception, dropping all mysticism, is that there is but one salvation
for man, which lies in his embracing in his heart the moral maxims."

Following the example of Kant, theologians began to give a rational
explanation of the Devil. Daub, a disciple of Schelling, attempted to
construct a philosophical devil, in his book *Judas Iscariot, or Evil in
its Relation to Goodness*, defining Satan, the Antichrist and enemy of
God, as the hatred of all that is good.

Schenkel regards the Evil One as a manifestation that appears in the
totality of things, and characterises him as that which is collectively
bad. "Satan, accordingly, is a 'juridical person,'" and this explains
his extraordinary and superindividual power; but he has not as yet
succeeded in becoming a single, concrete personality, and let us hope
that he probably never will. Hase does not deny the possibility of an
influence of spiritual powers, good as well as evil, upon man, "but,"
says he, "the Devil appears only when he is believed to exist; and the
effects of his influence being explicable only in the light of man's
nature, the reality of such beings remains problematic."

Reinhard, although inclined to supernaturalism, doubts whether the
Scriptural Devil is to be taken seriously; and De Wette speaks of the
Devil as a popular conception (*Volksvorstellung*). Schleiermacher in
his famous work *The Christian Faith According to the Doctrines of the
Evangelical Church* (1821; fourth edition, 1842) declares the idea of
the Devil, as historically developed, to be "untenable" and "unessential
to a Christian's belief in God."

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

Martensen believes in the Devil not as an idea, but as an "historical
person." He is in the beginning only the principle of temptation; as
such he is a cosmical principle. He is not yet bad, but the potentiality
of badness. He does not really become the Devil until man has allowed
him to enter his consciousness. Man, accordingly, gives existence to the
Devil. Lücke opposes Martensen: "The Devil as a symbol is absolutely
bad, but as a fallen creature he cannot be absolutely bad. We have no
other conception of the Devil than as the representative of sin." This
is an attempt to reconcile the theological conception with the
philosophy of his time.

David Friedrich Strauss did not consider it necessary to refute the
doctrine of Satan's personality, which he regarded as utterly
overthrown. Modern mysticism, on the other hand, shows an inclination to
emphasise the importance of the traditional Satanology.

Dogmatic theologians in the ranks of English and American Protestants
endeavor to preserve the traditional views of hell and the Devil,
without, however, making much practical use of these doctrines. They no
longer discuss the problem at length but still uphold the belief in the
personality of the Evil One. For instance, Professor Schaff scarcely
enters into a detailed exposition of the subject, and Dr. William G. T.
Shedd, who devotes in his great work *Dogmatic Theology* one or several
chapters to every Christian dogma, omits a particular discussion of
Satan. Passages in the chapter on hell nevertheless prove that he
believes in both a personal Satan and an eternal personal punishment on
the ground of scriptural evidence.

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

The liberal theology of to-day urges that Jesus makes thirst for
justice, love of God and man, the conditions for entering into the
Kingdom of God. A belief in the Devil, it is claimed, is nowhere
demanded and can, to say the least, not be regarded as essential; it is
not so much Christian and Jewish, as pagan; it is a survival of
polytheistic nature-worship and of pagan dualism, quite natural at a
time when the sciences were still in their infancy, characterised by
astrology and alchemy, and when the irrefragability of nature's laws was
not as yet understood. The belief in a personal Devil, accordingly, and
all the practices resulting therefrom, were rather due to ignorance than
to religion.

There are still plenty of believers in a personal Devil among those who
call themselves orthodox, but their influence has ceased to be of any
consequence. Vilmar regards the belief in an individual devilish
personality as an indispensable qualification of a real theologian,
saying: "In order rightly to teach and take charge of souls, one must
have seen the Devil gnashing his teeth, and I mean it bodily, not
figuratively; he must have felt his power over poor souls, his
blasphemy, especially his sneer." Similarly, another German theologian,
Superintendent Sanders, shows great zeal in defence of the Biblical
Devil in his pamphlet *The Doctrine of the Scriptures Concerning the
Devil* (1858), and Dr. Sartorius, following Hengstenberg's orthodoxy,
says that, "he who denies Satan cannot truly confess Christ." Twesten,
however, although accepting the belief in a personal Devil, concedes
that the necessity of his existence cannot be deduced from the contents
of our religious consciousness.

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fr. Reiff (in
*Zeitfragen des christlichen Volkslebens*, VI., 1, 1880) declares that
there is a Kingdom of Evil as much as there is a Kingdom of God. The
belief in a personal Prince of Darkness is the counterpart of a personal
God. And Erhard wrote an apology of the Devil, not so much for the sake
of the Devil as for the traditional idea that evil and sin are
actualities.

*Present Conditions*.

The Roman Catholic Church of to-day still holds in theory the same views
as in the Middle Ages; but the secular authorities will never again
allow themselves to be influenced in their legal proceedings by the
opinions of inquisitors.

Görres, <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) one of the ablest and most
modern defenders of the Roman Church, complains about "the purely
medical view" of historians who regard witch-prosecution as a mere
epidemic. He finds the ultimate cause of witchcraft and sorcery in
apostacy from the Church, which had become fashionable in those days.
Dr. Haas, another Roman Catholic, takes the same view in his inquiry
into witch-prosecution. <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223.md) He
concedes that witchcraft is a revival of pagan notions mixed with a
false conception of Christianity (p. 68), but he still shares with the
inquisitors of yore and with Pope Innocent III. the belief in the
actuality of witchcraft. Like Görres, Haas regards "witchcraft as the
product of heresy," and calls the former "a cousin" and "a daughter" of
the latter. Both to him result from "unbelief, unclearness, pride,

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

eccentricity." Both are manias or illusions (*Wahngeschöpfe*); "they
maltreat and are maltreated, and thus they increase until they are
opposed with reason and vigor." The only trouble was that the remedy of
inquisitorial "reason and vigor" was worse than the disease. Haas
continues: "For the minds of many were not yet free from error (i. e.,
heresy), and when the house was swept and cleaned worse spirits entered,
and matters were worse than ever."

The Inquisition, the natural result of a belief in the Devil, is now
powerless; "still," says the Rev. G. W. Kitchin, in the *Encyclopædia
Britannica*:

<span class="small">"Its voice is sometimes heard; in 1856 Pius IX.
issued an encyclical against somnambulism and clairvoyance, calling on
all bishops to inquire into and suppress the scandal, and in 1865 he
uttered an anathema against freemasons, the secular foes of the
Inquisition."</span>

The Rev. Mr. Kitchin sums up the present state of things as follows:

<span class="small">"The occupation of Rome in 1870 drove the papacy and
the Inquisition into the Vatican, and there at last John Bunyan's vision
seems to have found fulfilment. Yet, though powerless, the institution
is not hopeless; the Catholic writers on the subject, after long silence
or uneasy apology, now acknowledge the facts and seek to justify them.
In the early times of the 'Holy Office' its friends gave it high honor;
Paramo, the inquisitor, declares that it began with Adam and Eve ere
they left Paradise; Paul IV. announced that the Spanish Inquisition was
founded by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; Muzarelli calls it 'an
indispensable substitute to the Church for the original gift of miracles
exercised by the apostles.' And now again, from 1875 to this day, a
crowd of defenders has risen up: Father Wieser and the Insbruck Jesuits
in</span>

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

their journal (1877) yearn for its re-establishment; Orti y Lara in
Spain, the Benedictine Gams in Germany, and C. Poullet in Belgium take
the same tone; it is a remarkable phenomenon, due partly to despair at
the progress of society, partly to the fanaticism of the late pope, Plus
IX. It is hardly credible that any one can really hope and expect to see
in the future the irresponsible judgments of clerical intolerance again
humbly carried out, even to the death, by the secular arm."

Roman Catholic authors are, as a rule, too worldly wise to precipitate
or provoke a discussion of the history of either the Inquisition or the
doctrine of the Devil, but whenever they cannot avoid a discussion of
the subject they claim that the Inquisition was a secular institution
(so Gains of Ratisbon and Bishop Hefele), or defend the measures taken
by the Inquisition. They have not as yet acquired sufficient insight,
or, if they have the insight, they do not possess the moral courage to
condemn the whole institution, and with it the policy of the Popes
Innocent III., Gregory IX., Urban IV., John XXII., and others whose
names are compromised in matters of witch-prosecution.

Devil-exorcism is not yet extinct in Roman Catholic countries. The
exorcism performed in Germany by Father Aurelian on Michael Zilk, the
son of a Catholic Father and Protestant mother, with the especial
permission of the Bishop Leopold von Eichstadt, is a sufficient evidence
of the Egyptian darkness that still penetrates the minds of a great mass
of our Christian brethren, among them members of the higher
clergy. <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_224.md)

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

Mr. E. P. Evans, who quotes the curious occurrence, <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_225.md) furnishes another interesting fact. He
says:

<span class="small">Pope Leo XIII. is justly regarded as a man of more
than ordinary intelligence and more thoroughly imbued with the modern
spirit than any of his predecessors, yet he composed and issued,
November 19, 1890, a formula of an '*Exorcismus in Satanam et Angelos
Apostatas*.' His Holiness never fails to repeat this exorcism in his
daily prayers, and commends it to the bishops and other clergy as a
potent means of warding off the attacks of Satan and casting out
devils."</span>

The holy coat of Treves is still exercising its power over the minds of
many credulous people and works miracles that are seriously believed,
while the dancing-procession of Echternach is not only not abolished but
encouraged by the Church. Pope Leo XIII. has granted a six years'
absolution to all those who take part in the performance. There are on
an average about ten thousand persons who annually join in this stupid
survival of the Middle Ages.

\*      <sup>\*</sup>      \*

The personal Devil is dead in science, but he is still alive even in
Protestant countries among the uneducated, and the number of those who
belong to this category is legion. The Salvation Army is still in our
midst singing:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come join our army, the foe must be driven;  
To Jesus, our captain, the world shall be given.  
If hell should surround us we'll press through the throng.  
The Salvation Army is marching along."</span>

</div>

The following vigorous verse reminds one of Parseeism:

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Christian, rouse thee, war is raging.  
God and fiends are battle waging,  
Every ransomed power engaging,  
    Break the Tempter's spell.  
Dare ye still lie fondly dreaming,  
Wrapt in ease and worldly scheming,  
While the multitudes are streaming  
    Downwards into hell?"</span>

</div>

A good illustration of their personal attitude towards the Evil One
appears in these lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Devil and me, we can't agree,  
I hate him and he hates me.  
He had me once, but he let me go,  
He wants me again, but I will not go."</span>

</div>

The Devil of the Salvation Army proves that there is still a need of
representing spiritual ideas in drastic allegories; but though Satan is
still painted in glaring colors, he has become harmless and will
inaugurate no more witch-prosecutions. He is curbed and caged, so that
he can do no more mischief. We smile at him as we do at a tiger behind
the bars in a zoölogical garden.

*The Religious Import of Science*.

The inquisitors and witch-prosecutors were by no means scoundrels pure
and simple. Most assuredly there were scoundrels among them; but there
is no doubt that the movement of the Inquisition and witch-prosecution
took its origin from purer motives. It was to the popes and grand
inquisitors and to many princes and other people who promoted the
policy, a matter of conscience; they simply attended to it as a
religious duty, sometimes even with a heavy heart and not without great
pain.

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

Torquemada, the grand inquisitor of Spain, was in his private life one
of the purest and most conscientious of men, and he was so
tender-hearted that he was obliged to leave the inquisitorial tribunal
and quit the room as soon as the torture of a heretic began. He would
cry about the obstinacy of those who had given themselves over to Satan;
but though his heart was bleeding, he condemned thousands and thousands
to the cruelest tortures and the most dreadful death for the sake of
salvation and the glory of God--of that monster-god in whom he believed,
that abominable idol which was worse than the Moloch of ancient
Phoenicia.

When complaints reached Pope Innocent III. about the cruelty of Conrad
of Marburg, the first Inquisitor General of Germany, he said, "the
Germans were always furious and therefore needed furious judges." Pope
Leo X., referring to cases of witchcraft that happened in Brixen and
Bergamo, grieves in a brief of 1521 at "the obstinacy of the culprits,
who would rather die than confess their crimes." In the same document
the Holy Father complains about the impiety of the Venetian Senate who
prevented the inquisitors from performing their duties. And similar
expressions are not infrequent in later papal bulls and briefs, all of
which prove that the horrors of the Inquisition are ultimately due, not
to ill will or even to the desire for power, but to error which had
assumed the shape of a deep-seated religious conviction.

Among the Protestants, the Calvinists come nearest in zeal to the Roman
Catholic inquisitors. In Geneva, Switzerland, the home of Calvin, five
hundred persons were, within three months, executed for heresy and
witchcraft.

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The protocols of
the city in the year 1545 declare that the labor of torture and
execution exceeded the strength of the hangman; and the complaint is
made that, "whatever torture be applied, the malefactors still refuse to
confess."

The facts of witch-prosecution with its kindred superstitions are an
object lesson. How mistaken are those who believe that religion has
nothing to do with ethics, and that a religious conviction exercises no
influence upon a man's conduct! There are ethicists, professors of
ethics, and ethical preachers, who imagine that ethics may be taught
without teaching religion, and that the morality of the people can be
improved without an interference with their convictions as to the nature
of the world and the import of life. But a wrong world-conception will
beget a wrong morality; a false religion will unfailingly produce bad
and injurious ethics; and the grossest errors will, if they have their
way, find expression in the grossest abominations of misguided conduct.
A radical cure on the other hand must go to the root of the evil. It is
not sufficient to remove the symptoms of the disease, you must replace
false religion by true religion.

It would not do to say with our agnostic friends that religion is
concerned with matters unknowable; and that therefore we must leave it
alone! Religion is the most important problem of life, and we can ignore
it as little as a reckless storage of dynamite in crowded parts of great
cities. We must investigate the religious problem and replace the old
errors, with their dualistic superstitions by sound and scientifically
correct views. At the

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

bottom of all the terrors of the Inquisition and witch-prosecution lies
a serious endeavor to do what is right; and this power can be utilised
as well for the progress and elevation of mankind as for the suppression
of reason and sound judgment.

Religion is the strongest motive power in the world; nothing therefore
is more injurious than false religious convictions, and nothing more
desirable than truth.

Let us make the love of truth our religion. Beware of mysticism and
endeavor to be clear and exact. There is as little truth in mysticism as
there is light in fog. Nor should we rely on tradition, for tradition is
uncertain, but the truth (i. e., generalised statements of facts or laws
of nature) can be made unequivocally certain and will remain verifiable
to every competent inquirer. It is man's duty, in all departments of
life, to seek the truth with the best and most scientific methods at his
disposal, and the adherence to this principle is "the Religion of
Science."

It is a fact that the confidence in science has already become a
religious conviction with most of us. The faith in scientifically
provable truth has slowly, very slowly, and by almost imperceptible
degrees, but steadily and surely, taken root in the hearts of men.
To-day it is the most powerful factor of our civilisation, in spite of
various church-dogmas which are declared to be above scientific critique
and argument; for these dogmas are becoming a dead letter. There are
several conservative and prominent churchmen who publicly confess that
the dogmas of the Church must be regarded as historical documents and
not as eternal verities.

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

Those who doubt the religious import of science need only consider what
science has done for mankind by the radical abolition of
witch-prosecution, and they will be convinced that science is not
religiously indifferent, but that it is the most powerful factor in the
purification of the religions of mankind.

The world-conception of our industrial and social life, of international
intercourse, and all serious movements on the lines of human progress,
has even now to a great extent practically become the Religion of
Science, although the fact is not as Yet definitely and openly
acknowledged; and any sectarian faith that endeavors to set forth its
claim of recognition does it and can do it only on the ground that it is
one with scientific truth. For there is nothing universally true,
nothing catholic, nothing genuinely orthodox, except those truths that
are positively demonstrated by science.
