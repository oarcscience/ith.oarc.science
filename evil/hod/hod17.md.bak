# THE AGE OF THE REFORMATION.

THE Reformation, although in many respects a great advance did not
introduce a sudden change in the belief in the Devil. Nevertheless, the
tendency becomes more and more apparent to interpret Satan in
psychological terms, and instead of expecting him in the horrors of
nature or in the objective reality of our surroundings, to find. him in
our own hearts where he appears as temptation in all forms, as
allurement, ambition, vanity, as the vain pursuit of fortune, power, and
worldly pleasures.

Christianity was split up into two parties, the conservatives who
remained faithful to Rome's spiritual supremacy and the progressive
Protestants who opposed the traditional authorities of the Church and
clamored for reform in the various ways of life. Restless times of this
kind are favorable for satire and sarcasm, and the Devil therefore
naturally played an important part in the polemics on either side.

At the same time, the moral earnestness of the reformers forced the
authorities of the Church to abandon many of the worst misuses, and thus
the reform of the

not remain limited to the reformed Churches, but extended its blessings
to the Roman Church itself. The anti-reformation, whose backbone was the
Jesuits, was a most serious and rigorously pure movement born of a deep
religious piety; but it was darkened in its very start by a mysticism
verging on coarse superstition, and lacked that love of freedom, of

It is noticeable, however, that the moral element is pushed into the
foreground, and both parties begin to agree in this that morality is the
ultimate test of religion.

</span>

The idea of conceiving Satan as sin and temptation is not new (think
only of the illustrations in the *Hortus Deliciarum*), but the
conception of sin and temptation

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

begins now to be better understood as a psychological condition of
subjective states.

*Luther*.

Luther was, in his demonology, a real child of his time; he saw the
Devil everywhere, he struggled with him constantly, and overcame him by
his confidence in God. He regarded the Pope as an incarnation of Satan,
or as the Anti-Christ, and the Roman Church as the kingdom of the Devil.
He sang of him:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"And were this world with devils filled  
That threaten to undo its;  
We will not fear, for God hath willed  
His truth to triumph through us.  
Our ancient vicious foe  
Still seeks to work his woe.  
His craft and power are great  
And armed with cruel hate.  
On earth is not his equal.

.    .    .    .    .    .

"The Prince of this world  
His banner has unfurled  
And yet he will harm none  
For he is all undone;  
One little word defeats him."

</div>

The Devil was to Luther a real, living power, a concrete personality,
and he used to characterise him as the good Lord's hangman, and the
instrument of his anger and punishment. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) God needs the Devil for a servant and
utilises his malignity for the procreation of the good (x, 1259).

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

Luther's belief in the Devil was not only very realistic but also almost
childishly ingenuous. When at work he was prepared for his incessant
interference, and when going to rest he expected to be disturbed by him.
Luther was not afraid of him, yet the efforts he made in conquering the
Evil One are sufficient evidence that he regarded him as very powerful.
He protested he would go to Worms though every tile on the roofs of the
city were a Devil; he saw the fiend grinning at him while he translated
the Bible, and threw his inkstand at his Satanic Majesty. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_194.md)

By and by the familiarity between Luther and the Devil increased: "Early
this morning," Luther tells us in his *Tischreden*, "when I awoke the
fiend came and began disputing with me. 'Thou art a great sinner,' said
he. I replied, 'Canst not tell me something new, Satan?'"

Luther was inclined to believe in the Devil's power of assisting wizards
and witches in their evil designs. Following St. Augustine's authority
he conceded the possibility of *incubi* and *succubi*, because Satan, in
the shape of a handsome young man, loves to decoy young girls. He also
accepted the superstition of changelings and declared that witches
should suffer death; but when once confronted with a real case, he
insisted, when his counsel was sought, on the most scrupulous
circumspection. He wrote to the judge:

<span class="small">"I request you to explore everything with exactness
so as to leave no trace of fraud . . . for I have experienced so many
deceits,</span>

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="small">frauds, artifices, lies, treacheries, etc., that I
can scarcely make up my mind to believe. Therefore see and convince
yourself to your own satisfaction, lest you be mistaken and I may be
mistaken through you." <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_195.md)</span>

Although it is true that Luther's views of the Devil were as childish as
those of his contemporaries, it would be rash to denounce the
Reformation for having accomplished no progress and having done nothing
to suppress the barbarous superstitions of demonology. Luther's
God-conception was purer and nobler than the God-conception of the
leading churchmen and popes of his time, and thus his faith, in spite of
its crudities, led, after all, to purer conceptions, which were destined
gradually to overcome the old traditional dualism.

Luther demanded that Christ should not only be recognised as the Saviour
of mankind, but that every man should be able to say, "He has come to
save me personally and individually." Luther thus carried the religious
life into the very hearts of men and declared that there was no
salvation in ceremonies, absolutions, or sacraments;

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

unless one had individually, in one's own nature and being, vanquished
the temptations of Satan. The most dangerous idols are, according to
Luther, the pulpit and the altar, for sacraments and ceremonies cannot
save. They are symbols instituted to assist us. Those who believe that
ceremonies possess any power of their own are still under the influence
of the pagan notion that evils can be averted by sacrifices and
exorcisms.

*Luther's Successors*.

While Luther instinctively abhorred persecutions of any kind, he still
retained those beliefs which were the ultimate cause of witch
prosecution. We must, therefore, not be astonished to see even in
Protestant countries a revival of the horrors which had been inaugurated
by the Inquisition.

The most curious work of Protestant demonology is the *Theatrum
Diabolorum* by Sigmund Feyerabend, a

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

voluminous collection of the orthodox views of Luther's followers
concerning the existence, power, nature, and demeanor of devils.

Luther's belief in the Devil was crude, but he was even here morally
great, strong in his religious sentiment, and serious in his demand that
every one personally should honestly wage a war with the powers of evil,
and that no church, no intercession of saints, no formulas or rituals
had any saving power. Luther's followers retain all the crudities of
their master and to some extent his moral seriousness, but they fall
below the manliness of his spirit.

Feyerabend's *Theatrum Diabolorum*, "which," as the title says, "is a
useful and sensible book," contains a great number of essays written by
such prominent little authorities as Jodocus Hockerus Osnaburgensis,
Hermannus Hamelmannus, Andreas Musculus, Andreas Fabricius Chemnicensis,
Ludovicus Milichius, and others. The Reverend Hocker explains in
forty-eight chapters almost all possible problems connected with devils
whose number in Chapter VIII. is, according to Borrhaus, calculated to
be not less than 2,665,866,746,664.

of this last chapter, the Rev. Hermann Strack, concludes by saying:
"When we can obtain medicine let us not have a contempt for God's
valuable gifts, but withal let us always and all the time rest our
confidence and main comfort upon the only God."

The same conception of the Devil is presented with somewhat more
poetical skill by Jacob Ruffs who dramatised

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

the story of Job and the parable of the vineyard. The latter, which was
performed at Zürich, Switzerland, in 1539, May 26, introduces Satan as
he sows the seeds of sedition in the minds of the servants of the
vineyard and induces them to slay the son of their master.

Almost all these treatises, poor though they may be as literary,

established until in these latter days Satan himself was boldly and
directly by Protestant theologians declared to be a mere abstract idea
and a personification of evil. Yet this step was not taken at once, and
mankind had to pass first through a long period o wavering opinions, of
conflicting propositions, uncertainties, venomous controversies, and
anxious research for the truth.

*Shakespeare*.

The Protestant Devil became somewhat more cultured than the Catholic
Devil, for the advancement noticeable in the civilisation of Protestant
countries extended also to him. Says Mephistopheles in Faust:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Culture which smooth the whole world licks  
Also unto the Devil sticks."</span>

</div>

To note the progress, let us compare Wyntoun who wrote early in the
fifteenth century and Shakespeare. Wyntoun's witches are ugly, old hags;
Shakespeare's, although by no means beautiful, are yet interesting and
poetical; they are "so withered and so wild in their attire that look
not like the inhabitants o' th' earth and yet are on it." It is a
poetical fiction representing temptation. And in this same sense the
very word Devil is frequently used by Shakespeare. We are told, "'tis
the eye of childhood that fears a painted Devil," and one fiend, as we
read in Shakespeare, is the invisible spirit of wine. "The Devil," we
read in Hamlet, "hath power to assume a pleasing shape." And the meaning
of this sentence is plainly psychological, as we learn from another
passage in which Polonius says to his daughter:

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     "With devotion's visage  
And pious action we do sugar o'er  
The Devil himself."</span>

</div>

*Milton*.

The Protestant Devil, as a poetical figure, received his finishing
touches from Milton. And Milton's Devil acquires a nobility of soul,
moral strength, independence, and manliness which none of his ancestors
possessed, neither Satan, nor Azazel, nor his proud cousins the Egyptian
Typhon and the Persian Ahriman. The best characterisation of Milton's
Satan is given by Taine. He ridicules Milton's description of Adam and
Eve, who talk like a married couple of the poet's days. "I listen, and
hear an English household, two reasoners of the period--Colonel
Hutchinson and his wife. Heavens! Dress them! Folk so cultivated should
have invented first of all a pair of trousers." The picture of the Good
Lord is still more severely criticised. He says: "What a contrast
between God and Satan!" Taine continues:

"Milton's Jehovah is a grave king who maintains a suitable state,
something like Charles I.

"Goethe's God, half abstraction, half legend, source of calm oracles, a
vision just beheld after a pyramid of ecstatic strophes, greatly excels
this Miltonic God, a business man, a schoolmaster, a man for show! I
honor him too much in giving him these titles. He deserves a worse name.

"He also talks like a drill-sergeant. 'Vanguard to right and left the
front unfold.' He makes quips as clumsy as those of Harrison, the former
butcher turned officer. What a heaven! It is enough to disgust one with
Paradise; one would rather enter Charles the First's troop of lackeys,
or Cromwell's Ironsides. We

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="small">have orders of the day, a hierarchy, exact
submission, extra duties, disputes, regulated ceremonials, prostrations,
etiquette, furbished arms, arsenals, depots of chariots and
ammunition."</span>

How different is the abode of Satan. Taine says:

"The finest thing in connexion with this Paradise is Hell.

"Dante's hell is but a hall of tortures, whose cells, one below another,
descend to the deepest wells."

Milton's hell is the asylum of independence; it may be dreary but it is
the home of liberty that scorns abject servility. Milton describes the
place as follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"'Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,'  
Said then the last Archangel, 'this the seat  
That we must change for heaven? this mournful gloom  
For that celestial light? Be it so, since he,  
Who now is Sovran, can dispose and bid  
What shall be right: farthest from him is best,  
Whom reason has equal'd, force hath made supreme  
Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,  
Where joy for ever dwells! Hail, horrors, hail,  
Infernal world! and thou, profoundest hell  
Receive thy new possessor; one who brings  
A mind not to be changed by place or time.  
The mind is its own place, and in itself  
Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.  
What matter where, if I be still the same,  
And what I should be, all but less than he  
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least  
We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built  
Here for his envy; will not drive us hence:  
Here we may reign secure; and in my choice  
To reign is worth ambition, though in hell:  
Better to reign in hell, than serve in heaven."'</span>

</div>

It has been frequently remarked that Milton's Satan

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

is the hero of *Paradise Lost*, and, indeed, he appears as the most
sympathetic figure in the greatest religious epic of English literature.
His pride is not without self-respect which we cannot help admiring;
Satan exclaims:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Is there no place  
Left for repentance, none for pardon left?  
None left but by submission: and  
That word disdain forbids me. . . ."</span>

</div>

And how noble appears Milton's Satan! Milton personifies in Satan the
spirit of the English Revolution; Milton's Satan represents the honor
and independence of the nation asserted in the face of an incapable
government. Satan's appearance shows strength and dignity:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "He above the rest  
In shape and gesture proudly eminent  
Stood like a tower."</span>

</div>

And his character is distinguished by love of liberty. Taine describes
him as follows:

"The ridiculous Devil of the Middle Ages, a horned enchanter, a dirty
jester, a petty and mischievous ape, band-leader to a rabble of old
women, has become a giant and a hero.

"Though feebler in force, he remains superior in nobility, since he
prefers suffering independence to happy servility, and welcomes his
defeat and his torments as a glory, a liberty, and a joy."

The Devil naturally acquires noble features which make him less
diabolical and more divine in the measure that the God-conception of all
age becomes the embodiment of the conservatism of the ruling classes.
When the name and idea of God are misapplied to represent stagnation,
Satan might change places with God. A new sect of Devil-worshippers who
aspire for advancement

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

and progress in the name of Satan might have arisen had not
Protestantism, decried centuries ago as the work of the Devil, gained so
much influence that in time it became itself a great conservative power
in the world; and that its noble aspirations were first attributed to
the influence of the Devil is only preserved in verse and fable.

*The Devil in the Human Heart*.

The common people in Protestant countries knew nothing of the mighty
hero of *Paradise Lost*; they knew Satan only through the New Testament,
and, being little affected by the progress of the natural sciences, took
him as seriously as did the early Christians and the Dominicans of the
Inquisition. But there is this difference; the spirit of the Reformation
rested upon them with both its

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

moral earnestness and its subjectivism. The middle classes as a rule did
not fall a prey to the aberrations of former times; they practised no
exorcisms and showed no inclination to prosecute, but confined their
endeavors to the salvation of their own souls

The classical productions of the literature of this type are *Pilgrim's
Progress* and *The Heart of Man*, both

The first picture shows the human heart in its natural perversity, but
the sinner repents in the second picture, and the Holy Ghost takes
possession of his soul, ill the third picture. The fourth picture shows
us a contemplation of the sufferings of the Saviour and the Holy

Trinity resides in the soul as is illustrated in the fifth picture. But
worldly temptations and prosecutions, represented the former by a man
with a goblet and the latter by another man with a dagger, prevail upon
the heart and shake its good resolutions, which is seen in the sixth
picture; until at last, in the seventh picture, Satan with seven other
spirits more wicked than himself re-enters,

and the last state of that man is worse than the first. The practical
application of this analysis of the human heart is given in two
illustrations picturing the death of the pious and impious man. The
former, whose heart is depicted in the ninth picture, is portrayed in
the tenth picture, as being called by the Saviour to enjoy the eternal

bliss of Heaven; while the eighth picture exhibits the doom of the
latter who is lost forever in Hell.

The interesting feature of these illustrations consists in the method of
showing the elements of man's soul, his passions and aspirations as
foreign powers which enter, pass out, and re-enter. The heart itself
appears as an empty blank and its character is established by the
tendencies

which dwell in it. The psychology which lies at the bottom of the
author's belief, is not clearly pronounced; it may be either the
Brahmanical theory of the self, as a being in itself, or the Buddhist
doctrine of the illusoriness of the self, but it appears that the self,
as represented in the head above the heart, is a mere reflex of the
process that takes place within the human soul,

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

and should therefore be regarded merely as the principle of unity, the
moral worth of which depends upon the nature of its elements. The author
of these drawings has in his naive analysis of the human heart,
approached a scientific conception of the soul more closely than
presumably he was aware of himself.

*A Revival of Witch Prosecution*.

At the time of the Reformation witch prosecution ceased for a while. It
made room for another mania not less ugly and condemnable. Its place was
filled by heresy persecution. Not only did Roman Catholic governments
worry their Protestant subjects almost to death by confiscating their
property, chasing them with hounds to mass, exiling entire districts,
and ignominiously executing their leaders; but Protestants in their
turn, too, regarded it as their religious duty to do the same to all
dissenters. Luther himself, be it said to his everlasting honor, did not
persecute; and so long as he lived he succeeded in preventing among his
followers all persecutions. Calvin, however, ordered Servetus to be
burned alive, because his belief in the trinity differed from his own;
and King Henry VIII. of England resolutely suppressed with a high hand
all opposition to the religious views he happened to hold at the time;
nor did he shrink from shedding blood, although we must grant that he
exercised much judgment by confining his persecution to a comparatively
few powerful opponents.

While the fear of witchcraft was thus set aside for a time, the
dangerous belief in the power of Satan continued and lay bidden like
burning coals under ashes. The

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

religions superstitions remained practically the same, and it is natural
that the epidemic reappeared, although in a less virulent form. Even
Protestant countries (North Germany, Sweden, England, Scotland, and the
English colonies in North America) were visited by this spiritual
plague, and a number of lay judges appeared who showed the same zeal as
the Dominican inquisitors in Catholic countries.

With the waning of the zeal for burning witches the defenders of
witchcraft grew rather more numerous than before. Among them are Dr.
Thomas Erastus of Heidelberg, <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) and
Jean Bodin, a Frenchman. <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_198.md) The
Suffragan Bishop Peter Binsfeld <span id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_199.md)
and Justice Nicolaus Remigius <span id="fr_201"></span>[4](#fn_200.md)
defended in voluminous books with new arguments the policy of the
*Witch-Hammer*, and King James I. of England wrote a demonology <span
id="fr_202"></span>[5](#fn_201.md) filled with all the superstition of the
Middle Ages; Martin Delrio, <span id="fr_203"></span>[6](#fn_202.md) a
Jesuit, deems a revision of the belief in witchcraft in order, but comes
to the conclusion that the evil exists and that there is no remedy save
the use of relies, holy water, exorcisms, the holy sacraments of the
Roman Catholic Church.

The National Museum of Germanic Antiquities at Nuremberg possesses a
large poster which contains an account of three women who were burned as
witches at Dernburg in the year 1555. Although they were not

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

</span>

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

burned on the same day, the illustration represents them as standing on
the fagots together and the statement is made that in one instance, when
the fire was lit, Satan appeared and visibly carried away his paramour
through the air.

The tragedy of Dernburg is one case only among many. Mayor Pheringer, of
Nördlingen, swore to exterminate the whole brood of sorcerers, and Judge
Benedict Carpzov, Jr. (1595-1666), of Leipsic, following in the
footsteps of his father, condemned more than a hundred persons to die at
the stake for witchcraft.

*Sensible Prelates*.

The Protestants of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were on the
average perhaps more serious in their religious beliefs than the Roman
Catholics of the same period, and thus it happened that some French
prelates of the Roman Church, being more worldly wise and more deeply
imbued with the advancing spirit of the age than many bigoted
Protestants, displayed infinitely more common sense than their brethren
of the Reformed Churches.

This became particularly patent in the famous case of Martha Brossier, a
French peasant girl, who, in 1588, claimed to be possessed of a devil.
The excitement was great, and the pulpits resounded with alarming
denunciations apt to renew all the terrors of former witch prosecutions.
But Bishop Miron of Angers, and Cardinal De Gondi, Archbishop of Paris,
retained their tranquillity, and had the case investigated not only
according to a truly rational method, but even in a spirit of humor.

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

When the never-failing tests with exorcisms through sacred books and
holy water were administered, Bishop Miron so arranged matters that the
possessed girl was induced to draw wrong conclusions, and lo! simple
spring-water and the reading of a line from Virgil regularly brought on
epileptic fits, while neither the old reliable exorcisms nor the holy
water produced any effect when the girl did not apprehend the sacred
texts.

Believers in Satanic possession were not satisfied with Bishop Miron's
experiments, for they regarded them as a proof of the cunning of the
Devil who thus slyly deceived his enemies. The case was brought before
the Archbishop De Gondi, but he, too, proved sceptical and declared
after some judicious experiments that the demeanor of the possessed girl
was a mixed result of insanity and simulation.

*Urban Grandier*.

In spite of the sound judgment shown by these and other prelates, the
prosecutions of witches continued. In the case of Urban Grandier, a
priest, who was accused by the Ursuline nuns at Loudun in Western France
of having exercised Satanic powers upon their minds, the Archbishops of
Bordeaux recognised the malicious hostility and hysterical bitterness
with which the nuns bore witness against their preacher. Grandier was
not innocent in other respects, but there were many priests whose morals
were no better. Considering the innumerable contradictions in the
statements of his enemies, the Archbishop dismissed the case and he was
honorably reinstalled in his position. But that was not the end of it.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

It happened that M. de Laubordemont, a cousin of the prioress, while
attending to some business of the French Government in Loudun, heard of
the story and gave a highly colored report to Cardinal Richelieu, at
whose instance the investigation was renewed. In the second trial
Grandier had no chance; for Laubordemont was appointed judge. He
accepted the most ridiculous evidence. The devils who spoke out of the
mouths of the obsessed nuns were called upon as witnesses, and two
documents were produced which purported to be the original pact of
Grandier with Satan. One of them is signed by Grandier, the other bears
the signature of six devils, the authenticity of which is vouched for by
Baalbarith, the Secretary of his Satanic Majesty. The script is in
mirror writing. Four expert Doctors of the Sorbonne, although they never
doubted either the documents or the reality of the devils of the
obsessed nuns, saw fit to caution the judges not to admit the testimony
of Satan, because the slanderer and liar could not be a trustworthy
witness. But the exorcising fathers, all of whom were Carmelite monks,
laid down the principle that a properly exorcised devil cannot help
confessing the truth. Grandier was cruelly tortured and executed on
August 18; but Peter Lactantius, the chief exorcist whom the dying
Grandier had challenged to appear before the tribunal of God, died a
raving maniac exactly one month after the death of his victim, on
September 18.

*A Protestant Witch-Execution*.

Much has been said and written about the cruelty of the Roman Catholic
methods of witch-prosecution, but

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

the Protestants were not a whit better, except perhaps that they added
to the proceedings a good deal more of pious cant and accompanied
executions with a religious unction which made their conduct the more
detestable. As a typical case we quote an abbreviated report of the
execution of three witches, Susanna, Ilse, and their mother Catharine,
which took place at Arendsee, 1687, August 5:  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203.md)

"The case was submitted for another revision, during which time six
clergymen attended daily upon the three prisoners and exhorted them to
pray and sing and repent. Then they were cited before the court one
after the other and the clergymen stood behind them. The president of
the court asked them once more, first Susanna, whether she had received
an incubus; (answer: Yes!) Secondly Ilse, whether her mother had given
her an incubus; (answer: Yes!) and thirdly Catharine, whether she had
given an incubus to Ilse; (answer: Yes!) Thereupon the Notary, Mr. Anton
Werneccius, read the judgment, and the executioner went to the court and
asked for mercy in case he should not succeed at once in decapitating
Susanna and Ilse. The question was asked whether there was any
additional grievance. Then the rod was broken, table and chairs of the
court upset, and the procession moved out to the Köppenberg, the place
of execution.

"Part of the guards opened the way. Each one of the three witches was
accompanied on either side by a clergyman and led with a rope by a
hangman. At the same time six armed citizens surrounded her. Another
part of the guard closed the procession.

"On the way prayers alternated with exhortations and singing of hymns.

"Before the Seehausen gate a circle was made and Susanna was led round
until the public had finished singing the hymn 'God our father, dwell
with us.'

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

'When her head was taken off, the people sang, 'To thee we pray, O Holy
Ghost.' <span id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_204.md)

"Next came Ilse who was killed in the same way, accompanied by the
singing of the same hymns.

"While the singing continued Catharine was placed upon the fagots and
her neck fastened with an iron chain, which was drawn so tight that her
face swelled and became suffused with a brown color. The fagots were lit
and all present, clergy, school-children, and spectators sang until her
body was consumed in the fire."

*Witch-Prosecution in America*.

Not less terrible fruit than in Europe did the belief in witchcraft bear
on the free soil of Protestant America. Death-sentences for witchcraft
occurred several times after the foundation of the New England colonies;
but the last and most terrible outbreak took place in Salem,
Massachusetts, as recorded in Upham's *History of Salem Witchcraft*, and
in Drake's *Witchcraft Delusion in New England*. Under the baneful
influence of the religious teachings of Increase Mather and his son,
Cotton Mather, <span id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_205.md) two Boston
clergymen, the Rev. Samuel Parris, minister of the Church in Salem,
began to have a case of witchcraft investigated, which, as says
President Andrew Dickson White, <span id="fr_207"></span>[3](#fn_206.md)
"would have been the richest

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

of farces had they not led to events so tragical." The possessed behaved
like maniacs in court and charged a poor old Indian woman with having
bewitched them. Her husband, an ignorant fool, was induced to testify
against her. This easy success emboldened the believers in witchcraft,
among whom the Putnam family played a prominent part. They began to
prosecute some of the foremost people of New England; several men and
women were executed, many fled for their lives, and a reign of terror
ensued. Any person once suspected and accused was doomed. As an instance
we quote the case of Mr. Burroughs, a clergyman, who on account of petty
parish quarrels with the Putnam family had been dismissed from the
ministry. President White says:

<span class="small">"Mr. Burroughs had led a blameless life, the only
thing ever charged against him by the Putnams being that he insisted
strenuously that his wife should not go about the parish talking of her
own family matters. He was charged with afflicting the children,
convicted, and executed. At the last moment he repeated the Lord's
Prayer solemnly and fully, which it was supposed no sorcerer could do,
and this, together with his straightforward Christian utterances at the
execution, shook the faith of many in the reality of diabolical
possession."</span>

President White continues:

"Ere long it was known that one of the girls had acknowledged that she
had belied some persons who had been executed, and especially Mr.
Burroughs, and that she had begged forgiveness; but this for a time
availed nothing. Persons who would not confess were tied up and put to a
sort of torture which was effective in securing new revelations.

"In the case of Giles Cory the horrors of the persecution culminated.
Seeing that his doom was certain, and wishing to preserve

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="small">his family from attainder and their property from
confiscation, he refused to plead. He was therefore pressed to death,
and, when in his last agonies his tongue was pressed out of his mouth,
the sheriff with his walking-stick thrust it back again."</span>

Increase and Cotton Mather were the last defenders of diabolical
possession and witchcraft on American soil; the latter saw in his later
years a new era dawning upon his country. Vigorously and successfully
censured by Robert Calef, a courageous Boston merchant, he bemoaned the
decay of the religious spirit among the growing generation, and even to
his dying hour regarded the mere unbelief in witchcraft as an attack
upon the glory of the Lord.

The present generation may well smile at his mistaken religious notions;
but granting him that the old conception of God as a miracle-worker and
an individual ego-being after the fashion of pagan personifications be
right, his idea of the importance of a belief in witchcraft is logically
correct. If witchcraft is impossible, then there can be no wizard-god
who changes sticks into serpents, who stops the sun in his course,
reverses the shadow of the dial, is jealous of other gods and of the
familiar spirits of witches. The abandonment of the belief in witchcraft
tacitly implied the abandonment of a belief in God as a miracle-worker,
and prepared the way for a nobler religious faith which surrendered the
idea of seeking God in the suppositions possibility of breaking the laws
of nature, and finally found him in the cosmic order itself, i. e., in
the unity, the harmony, the rightness of those eternal factors of
existence which are the conditions of reason, of truth, and of justice.
