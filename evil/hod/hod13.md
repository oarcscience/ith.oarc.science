# THE IDEA OF SALVATION IN GREECE AND ITALY.

ἀλλὰ ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ ποηροῦ.  
                            Matt. vi. 14.

THE first century of our era is a time in which the fear of evil leads
to the organisation of religious institutions having in view the
atonement of sin and the redemption of the soul from the terrors of
hell. The ideas evil, sin, hell, salvation, and immortal life were
familiar to the Greek mind even before the days of Plato, but were still
mixed up with the traditional mythology. When philosophers began to wage
war against the gross idolatry of Greek polytheism, a fermentation set
in which prepared the Greek nation for the reception of Christianity. We
say "prepared," but we might just as well say that it resulted in the
formation of the Christian Church as an institution to deliver mankind
from evil. The fear of punishment in the life to come led in the days of
savagery to human sacrifices as a vicarious atonement. This barbarous
practice was abandoned in the progress of civilisation by a substitution
of animal victims. But the idea lingered in the minds of the people and
was retained in

Kantharos means both scarabæus-beetle, the Egyptian symbol of immortality, and the drinking vessel used in the mysteries which probably derives its name from some unknown connexion with the scarabæus. Underneath we see Heracles taming the three-headed Cerberus in the moment of crossing the Acheron, which originates (see Homer, Odyssey, X, 513) in the conflux of Cocytos and Pyriphlegethon. Hermes points out the road leading back to the upper world. The Danaides with the water vessels on the right bear their punishment with placidity, while Sisyphos on the left seems to be more severely taxed. Dire Necessity (Ἀνάγκη) holds the whip in her right hand, but her left extends to the sufferer a laurel branch. (The branch is missing in many similar pictures. It is apparently not an apple branch, which was a symbol of Nemesis, as some archæologists suggest.)</p>

Underneath are the judges of the dead, Triptolemos, Aiacus, and Rhadamanthys, the latter in the attitude of pleading a case with great zeal.</p>
<p>The upper scene on the left represents Megara and her sons, the Heraclides, innocent victims of a cruel fate in life, who are here comforted.

restated under the influence of Paul's message of the crucified, and

The Greeks, equally with other nations, feared punishment after death as
the greatest evil, and their belief in hell can be traced back to the
dawn of the history of Greece.

Homer represents the dead as unsubstantial forms, like dream images.
However, an exception is made in the case of Hercules, whose shadow is
in Hades, while Hercules himself, who is an Immortal, lives among the
gods in Olympus (*Odyssey*, XI., 601-626). Another hero whose fate after
death is more cheerful than that of common people is Menelaos. Being a

When the spread of gnostic views prepared the Greek nation for
Christianity, the ancient pagan myths

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

were not abandoned but transformed. Hesiod tells us in the Theogony of
the terrible struggle between Zeus and the Titans; and St. Peter, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_80) when speaking in his second letter of the
revolution of the angels that sinned, says that "God hurled them down to
Tartarus." The expression, however, is obliterated in the version of
King James, for the word ταρώταρσας (having hurled them to Tartarus) is
translated "sent them down to hell."

We read in the Theogony of the battle between Zeus and the monster
Typhon (also called Typhoeus):

<span class="small">"When Zeus had driven the Titans out from heaven,
huge Earth bare her youngest born son, Typhoeus, . . . . whose hands,
indeed, are fit for deeds on account of their strength. . . . . On his
shoulders there were one hundred heads of a serpent, of a fierce dragon,
playing with dusky tongues. From the eyes in his wondrous heads fire
struggled beneath the brows. From his terrible mouths voices were
sending forth every kind of sound ineffable, the bellowing of a bull,
the roar of a lion, the barking of whelps, and the hiss of a serpent.
The huge monster would have reigned over mortals unless the sire of gods
and men quickly observed him.</span>

This description reminds us not only of the Second Epistle of St. Peter,
but also of Revelation, xii. 7-9:

<span class="small">"And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels
fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels; and
prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the
great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil and Satan,
which deceiveth the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his
angels were cast out with him."</span>

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

Thus the old Greek demons merely changed names and reappeared in new
personalities. In this shape they were embodied into the canonical books
of the New Testament and became the integral part of the new religion,
which at that time began to conquer the world.

The legends of Perseus are in many respects similar to the tales of
Hercules. Perseus, too, the Greek prototype of the Christian St. George,
is a divine saviour. Assisted by Athene, he liberates Andromeda, the

and slays the Chimera, a monster half lion, half goat, representing
barbarism and savagery, or some similar evils.

Some of the tales of divine saviours may be ultimately founded upon
local Greek traditions, but many features of these religious myths
indicate that they were introduced early from the Orient whose religions
began to influence the occidental nations at the very dawn of their
civilisation. Thus Hercules is the Tyrian Baal Melkarth, probably
identical with the Babylonian Bel,--the conqueror of Tiamat; and his
twelve labors are the deeds of the sun-god in the twelve months of the
year. Phœnix-like, he dies by

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

self-combustion and rises in a transfigured shape from the flames of the
pyre. The Jews also appropriated the figure of this solar hero in the
shape of [Samson](errata.htm#2) whose strength is conditioned by his
hair, as the power of the sun lies in his rays.

In spite of the strong admixture of foreign mythology, Hercules has
become the national hero of Greece, and the Greek idea of salvation has
found in him the most typical expression, which has been most
beautifully worked out by Æschylus in a grand tragedy which represents

<span id="img_21000"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PROMETHEUS TIED BY

misery by Zeus as a punishment for the sin of having brought the bliss

Hercules, arrives, and, killing the eagle that lacerates the liver of
the bold hero, sets him free.

Prometheus and Hercules are combined into one person in the Christian
Saviour, Jesus Christ. The similarity of the story of Golgotha with the
myth of Prometheus is not purely accidental. For observe that in some of
the older pictures, as for instance in the vase of

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

Chiusi (see illustration on [p. 210](#page_210)), Prometheus is not
chained to a rock but tied to a pole, i. e., to a σταυρός or cross, and
Greek authors frequently use expressions such as the verb
ἀνασκολοπίϩεσϑαι (Æschylus) and ἀνασταυ ροῦσϑαι, (Lucian) which mean "to
be crucified." <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87)

Seneca speaks of Hercules as the ideal of the good man who lives
exclusively for the welfare of mankind. Contrasting him to Alexander the
Great, the conqueror of Asia, he says (De *Benef*., I., 14):

<span class="small">"Hercules never gained victories for himself. He
wandered through the circle of the earth, not as a conqueror, but as a
protector. What, indeed, should the enemy of the wicked, the defensor of
the good, the peace-bringer, conquer for himself either on land or
sea!"</span>

Epictetus praises Hercules frequently and declares that the evils which
he combated served to elicit his virtues, and were intended to try him
(I., 6). Zeus, who is identified with God, is called his father and
Hercules is said to be his son (III., 26). Hercules, when obliged to
leave his children, knew them to be in the care of God. Epictetus says
(III., 24):

<span class="small">"He knew that no man is an orphan, but that there is
a father always and constantly for all of them. He had not only heard
the words that Zeus was the father of men, for he regarded him as his
father and called him such; and looking up to him he did what Zeus did.
Therefore he could live happily everywhere."</span>

In Christianity the struggles of the saviour receive a dualistic
interpretation and are spiritualised into a victory

over the temptations of the flesh and other worldly passions.

\*      <sup>\*</sup>      \*

The conception of evil as hell received a philosophical foundation in
the dualism of Plato who did not shrink from depicting its minutest
details; and his views of the future state of the soul, its rewards in
heaven and hell, are in close agreement with Christian doctrines, even
in

(Seventh century. Mosaic in the cathedral of Monreale, Sicily.)  
</span>

most of their details, with the exception of the doctrine of the
transmigration of the soul.

Plato concludes his book on the Republic (X., 614-621) with the tale of
Er, the son of Armenius, a man who had died and come back to life for
the purpose of giving information to mankind concerning the other world
which might serve to warn people as to what they had to expect in the
life to come. Plato says that this Er, a Pamphylian by birth, was slain
in battle, but when the dead were taken up his body was found unaffected
by decay, and, on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the funeral pile,
he returned to life. Plato continues:

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

"He \[Er, the son of Armenius\] said that when his soul left the body he
went on a journey with a great company, and that they came to a
mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth; they
were near together, and over against them were two other openings in the
heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated, who
commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and had bound
their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly way on the
right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend
by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore the symbols of their
deeds, but fastened on their backs.

"Er said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they
suffered tenfold."

Hell is described as follows:

<span class="small">"'And this,' said Er, 'was one of the dreadful
sights which we ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern,
and, having completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when
of a sudden Ardiaeus \[the tyrant\] appeared and several others, most of
whom were tyrants; and there were also, besides the tyrants, private
individuals who had been great criminals: they were, as they fancied,
about to return into the upper world, but the mouth, instead of
admitting them, gave a roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or
some one who had not been sufficiently punished, tried to ascend; and
then wild men of fiery aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound,
seized and carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and
foot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with scourges, and
dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on thorns like
wool, and declaring to passers-by what were their crimes, and that they
were being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors
which they had endured, he said that there was none like the terror
which each of them felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice;
and when there was silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy.
These, said Er, were the penalties and retributions, yet there were
blessings as great."</span>

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

The idea of the rising and sinking of the wicked in hell is similar to
the Buddhist view of Buddhagosha who in his parables (translated by
Capt. T. Rogers, R. E., pp. 128-129) tells us how the condemned go up
and down like grains of rice in a boiling cauldron. The conceptions of
the mouth of hell, of the fierce tormentors and the various punishments
are probably older than Plato; they reappear in the gnostic doctrines
and were retained by Christianity down to the age of the Reformation.

The belief in hell and the anxiety to escape its terrors produced
conditions which are drastically described by Plato, who says, speaking
of the desire of the wicked to ransom their souls from a deserved
punishment:

<span class="small">"Mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and
persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of
making an atonement for a man's own or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices
or charms, with rejoicings and feasts. . . . And they produce a host of
books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were children of the Moon and
the Muses--that is what they say--according to which they perform their
ritual, and persuade not only individuals, but whole cities, that
expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and
amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at the service of
the living and the dead; the latter sort they call mysteries, and they
redeem us from the pain of hell, but if we neglect them no one knows
what awaits us."</span>

The dualism that underlies Plato's views began to be taken more
seriously by his disciples, the Neo-Platonists, and reached an
extraordinary intensity in the beginning of the Christian era. The
philosopher longed for death, and the common people feared the terrors
of the next life.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

The philosophical longing for death is satirically described in one of
the epigrams of Callimachus, who says (No. XXIV):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cleombrot, <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88) he
of Ambracia, took leave of the sun in the heavens:  
    Leapt from a wall in the hope Sooner to reach the Beyond;  
Not that he e'er had encountered an ill that made life to him hateful;  
    Merely because he had read Plato's grand book on the soul."</span>

</div>

The idea of immortality became more and more accepted by the masses of
the people; but there were many to whom it was no welcome news, for it
served only to enhance the fears of man's fate after death. Acquaintance
with other religions revealed new terrors everywhere. The Egyptians'
dread of judgment in the nether world, the Jews' horror of Gehenna, the
Hindus' longing for an escape from future sufferings, were now added to
the Greek notions of Hades, and rendered them more terrible than before.
The Christian conception of hell is more fearful and at the same time
drastic than any one of the older beliefs in future punishment.

Lucian tells the story of Peregrinus, surnamed Proteus, who after
various adventures became a convert to Christianity. He would have been
forgotten and his name would never have been mentioned in history but
for the fact that in the presence of a great crowd at the Olympian
festivals he burned himself to death on a big pile of wood.

All these strange facts were symptoms which illustrated the religious
zeal of the people and characterised

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

the unrest of the times. Further, Plutarch tells us in his Morals that
the superstitious are chastised by "their own imagination of an anguish
that will never cease." He says:

<span class="small">"Wide open stand the deep gates of the Hades that
they fable and there stretches a vista of rivers of fire and Stygian
cliffs; and all is canopied with a darkness full of fantasms, of
spectres threatening us with terrible faces and uttering pitiful
cries."</span>

Mr. F. C. Conybeare, in his Monuments of Early Christianity, says,
concerning the belief in hell:

<span class="small">"We make a mistake if we think that this awful
shadow was not cast across the human mind long before the birth of
Christianity. On the contrary, it is a survival from the most primitive
stage of our intellectual and moral development. The mysteries of the
old Greek and Roman worlds were intended as modes of propitiation and
atonement, by which to escape from these all-besetting terrors, and
Jesus the Messiah, was the last and best of the λυτήριοι θεοὶ, of the
redeeming gods. In the dread of death and in the belief in the eternal
fire of hell, which pervaded men's minds, a few philosophers excepted,
Christianity had a *point d'appui*, without availing itself of which it
would not have made a single step towards the conquest of men's
minds."</span>

And why was Christ a better Saviour than the gods and heroes of Greece?
Simply because he was human and realistic, not mythological and
symbolical; he was a sufferer and a man,--the son of man, and not a
slayer, not a conqueror, not a hero of the ferocious type, ruthless and
bloodstained; he fulfilled the moral ideal which had been set up by
Plato, who, perhaps under the impression of Æschylus's conception of the
tragic fate of

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prometheus, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_89) says of the perfect man who would rather
be than appear just:

<span class="small">"They will tell you that the just man who is thought
unjust will be scourged, racked, bound; will have his eyes burnt out;
and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be hung up at
the pale."</span>

The strangest thing about this passage is that the word
ἀνασχινδυλευϑήσεται, which means "he will be hung up at the stake," or
"fixed on a pale," is an older synonym of the New Testament term
σταυρόειν, commonly translated "to crucify."

Alluding to Plato, Apollonius, a Christian martyr, declares:

<span id="img_21800"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![CHRISTIAN

 <span id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_90)

<span class="small">One of the Greek Philosophers said: The just man
shall be tortured, he shall be spat upon, and last of all be shall be
crucified. just as the Athenians Passed an unjust sentence of death, and
charged him falsely, because they yielded to the mob, so also our
Saviour was at last sentenced to death by the lawless." <span
id="fr_92"></span>[3](#fn_91)</span>

In the days of Augustus and his successors the people were taught to
expect salvation, the dispensation of justice, protection, peace, and
prosperity from the emperor; and just as we have to-day monarchies where
the king regards himself as the Anointed One by the grace of God and a
representative of God on earth, so the Roman emperor arrogated to
himself divine honors, and even philosophers such as Seneca did not
hesitate to acknowledge

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

the claim. The practical significance of this view is that the
government should be regarded with religious awe, and its officers, as
such, are divine. The Christians who refused to worship before the
emperor's images must have appeared to the Romans of those days as
anarchists and rebels. But when Nero committed matricide and other most
outrageous crimes, the belief in the emperor's divinity dwindled away,
and the idea of the suffering God, the man who died on the cross because
he would rather be than appear just, gained ground among the people.

Christianity was not the only religion which promised deliverance from
evil through the saving power of blood and by means of a vicarious
atonement, for we know of the immortality-promising mysteries, and
especially of the cult of Mithras, which had embodied many ideas and
ceremonies that are also met with in Christianity.

The early Christians belonged exclusively to the lower walks of life,
and the earliest Church authorities, with few exceptions, were by no
means cultured or highly educated persons. Some Christian writers were
quite talented men; but few of the Church fathers can be said to have
enjoyed more than a mediocre education. Platonic philosophy, for
instance, did not enter into Christian minds directly, but only through
the channels of Philo's books. Thus it is natural that Christians were
lacking both in knowledge as to the origin of many of their rites and
also in critique, and when they were confronted with the same practices
and conceptions

among non-Christians, they were puzzled and found no other explanation
for such remarkable coincidences, than the guiles of Satan. Even the
most peculiarly Christian sacrament, the Lord's Supper, was, according
to the testimony of Justin Martyr, celebrated by the Persians in the
same way as by the Christians; <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_92) and
Justin is ingenuous enough to attribute this coincidence without the
slightest hesitation to the influence of evil spirits. Tertullian is
also aware of many similarities between Church institutions and the
pagan modes of Mithras worship, which observation prompted him to
declare that "Satan imitates the sacraments of God." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_93) The Devil appears to have been very
cunning in those days, for if he had not daring spies in heaven, he must
himself have anticipated the Lord's plans; for the pagan institutions
spoken of as Satanic imitations, such as the Persian haoma sacrifice,
the eating of consecrated cakes in commemoration

embody the religious ideals of the age, for various reasons failed to be
satisfactory, leaving the field to Christianity, which in its main
doctrines was simple and in its morality direct and practical. But it is
to be regretted that the fanaticism of Christian monks has almost
totally wiped out the traces of other religious aspirations, leaving
only scattered fragments, which are, however, very interesting to the
historian, partly on account of their similarity to Christianity, partly
through their dissimilarities.

We know of several Oriental gods who became fashionable at Rome, among
whom Mithras, the Egyptian Serapis, and Iao-Abraxas were the most
celebrated.

The influence of Mithras worship on Christianity is well
established. <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_96) We mention especially
the rites of baptism, the Eucharist, facing the Orient in prayer, the
sanctification of the day of the sun, and the celebration of the winter
solstice as the birthday of the Saviour. Concerning this latter
institution, the Rev. Robert Sinker says in William Smith's *Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities* (pp. 357-8):

"As Mithraicism gradually blended with Christianity, changing its name
but not altogether its substance, many of its ancient notions and rites
passed over too, and the Birthday of the Sun, the visible manifestation
of Mithras himself, was transferred to the commemoration of the Birth of
Christ.

"Numerous illustrations of the above remarks may be found in ancient
inscriptions, e. g., SOLI INVICTO ET LUNAE AETERNAE C. VETTI GERMANI
LIB. DUO PARATUS

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

ΑΝΙΚΗΤΩ <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_98) (Gruter, *Inscriptiones
Antiquae*, p. xxxiii). In the legend on the reverse of the copper coins
of Constantine, SOLI INVICTO COMITI, <span
id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_99) retained long after his conversion, there
is at once an idea of the ancient Sun-God, and of the new Sun of
Righteousness.

"The supporters of this theory cite various passages from early
Christian writers indicating a recognition of this view. The sermon of
Ambrose, quoted by Jablonsky, is certainly spurious, and is so marked in
the best editions of his works; it furnishes, however, an interesting
illustration of an early date. The passage runs thus: 'Bene quodammodo
sanctum hunc diem Natalis Domini *Solem novum* vulgus appellat, et tanta
sui auctoritate id confirmat, ut Judaei etiam atque Gentiles in hanc
vocem consentiant. Quod libenter amplectandum nobis est, quia oriente
Salvatore, non solum humani generis salus, sed etiam solis ipsius
claritas innovatur.' <span id="fr_101"></span>[4](#fn_100) (*Serm.* 6,
*in Appendice*, p. 397, ed. Bened.)

"In the Latin editions of Chrysostom is a homily, wrongly ascribed to
him, but probably written not long after his time, in which we read:
'Sed et *Invicti Natalem* appellant. Quis utique tam invictus nisi
Dominus noster, qui mortem subactam devicit? Vel quod dicunt Solis esse
Natalem, ipse est Sol Justitiae, de quo Malachias propheta dixit,
Orietur vobis timentibus nomen ipsius Sol Justitiae et sanitas est in
pennis ejus.' <span id="fr_102"></span>[5](#fn_101) (*Sermo de
Nativitate S. Joannis Baptistae*; vol. ii. 1113, ed. Paris, 1570.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

"Leo the Great finds fault with the baneful persuasion of some 'quibus
haec dies solemnitatis nostrae, non tam de Nativitate Christi, *quam de

id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_102) (*Serm*. 22, § 6, vol. i. p. 72, ed.
Ballerini.) Again, the same father observes: 'Sed hanc adorandam in

Æon, the lion faced, with key, torch, and measuring staff is a divinity
of considerable importance in the religion of Mithras. He is the Zrvan
Akarana (Time unlimited) of the *Zend-avesta*, not so much a personality
as a personified abstraction, representing the primordial state of
existence from which Ahura Mazda is born. The serpent's coils that
surround his body represent the revolutions of time, his wings the four
seasons. His relation to the deities of the Greek pantheon, Hephæstus,
Æsculapius, Hermes, and Dionysius, is indicated by the presence of their
emblems.

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

Mr. W. C. King quotes from Flaminius Vacca (No. 117) the interesting
story of the discovery of an Æon statue as follows:

<span class="small">"I remember there was found in the vineyard of Sig.
Orazio Muti (where the treasure was discovered), opposite S. Vitale, an
idol in marble, about 5 palms high (31/2 feet), standing erect upon a
pedestal in an empty chamber, with the door walled up. Around him were
many little lamps in terra cotta, set with their nozzles towards the
idol. This had a lion's head, and the rest of the body that of a man.
Under his feet was a globe, whence sprang a serpent which encompassed
all the idol, and its head entered into his mouth. He had his hands
crossed upon the breast: a key in each, four wings fastened upon the
shoulders, two pointing upwards, two downwards. I do not consider it a
very antique work, being done in a rude manner; or perhaps it is so
ancient that at the time it was made the good style was not yet known.
Sig. Orazio, however, told me that a theologian, a Jesuit Father,
explained its meaning, saying it signified the Devil, who in the time of
heathenism ruled over the world; hence the globe under his feet; the
serpent which begirt him and entered into his mouth, his foretelling the
future with ambiguous responses; the keys in his hands, his sovereignty
over the world; the lion's head, the ruler of all beasts. The wings
signified his presence everywhere. Such was the version given by the
aforesaid Father. I have done everything to see the idol, but Sig.
Orazio being now dead, his heirs do not know what has become of it. It
is not unlikely that by the advice of the theologian, Sig. Orazio may
have sent it to some *lime-kiln to cure its dampness*, for it had been
buried many and many a year."</span>

Iao, the god with the adorable name (i. e., Abraxas), <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108) bears the cock's head, which is the
emblem of Æsculapius, the god of healing. When Socrates died he
requested

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

his friends to sacrifice a cock to Æsculapius because his soul had
recovered from the disease of bodily existence. The serpent (the emblem
of mystery, of eternity, of wisdom, the prophet of the gnosis) walks
without feet, and therefore Iao is serpent-legged.

The God of Goodness, or Agathodæmon, exercised a great charm upon the
minds of the people. He is represented on gems in the shape of a serpent
whose head is surrounded with solar rays, hovering about the sacred

cista, the cylindrical box, from which the priest emerged at the
celebration of the mystery.

The design of the Agathodæmon is as common as the Iao design and that it
was used as an amulet appears from a passage of Galen, who says:

<span class="small">"Some, indeed, assert that a virtue of this kind is
inherent in certain stones, such as is in reality possessed by the green
jasper, which benefits the chest and mouth of the stomach, if tied
upon</span>

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

<span class="small">them. Some, indeed, set the stone in a ring and
engrave upon It a serpent with his head crowned with rays, according as
is prescribed by King Nechepsos in his thirteenth book."</span>

How excusable these gnostic superstitions were in those days appears
from the strange fact that such a sober man as Galen believed in the
efficiency of these amulets. He continues:

<span class="small">"Of this I have had ample experience, having made a
necklace of such stones and hung it round the patient's neck, descending
low enough for the stones to touch the mouth of the stomach, and they
proved to be of no less benefit thus than if they had been engraved in
the manner laid down by King Nechepsos." (De Simp. Med., IX.)</span>

To us who have grown up under the influence of Christian traditions, the
idea of representing the Good God under the allegory of a serpent seems
strange, but we must bear in mind that other people and other ages had
different ideas associated with the serpent. To the people of the Orient
the limbless serpent was a symbol of mystery, and represented health and
immortality. Eusebius (I., 7) informs us:

<span class="small">"The serpent never dies naturally, but only when
injured by violence, whence the Phoenicians have named it the good
genius (Agathodæmon). Similarly the Egyptians have called him Cneph and
given him a hawk's head on account of the special swiftness of that
bird."</span>

Serapis, which is a Hellenised form of Osiris-Apis,

sacred symbol was the cross, as we know through Christian authors, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_111) and Emperor Adrian (no mean authority in
such matters) speaks of Serapis worshippers as Christians, saying that
those who consecrated themselves to Serapis called themselves "bishops
of Christ." Even if a local blending of Christianity with the Serapis
cult in Egypt had not taken place we must recognise that the monkish
institutions of the Serapean temples were an exact prototype of the
Christian monasteries which originated in Egypt and flourished there
better than anywhere else.

The Serapis cult was a reformation of the old Egyptian Osiris worship,
introduced by Ptolemy Soter for the purpose of adapting the old
traditions of Egypt to the Hellenic culture of Alexandria.

Akin in spirit but independent in its development, is the worship of the
Egyptian Tot, the ibis-headed scribe of the gods. Originally a
personification of the moon, Tot, or Tehuti, was the deity of all
measure, and thus his importance grew to signify the divine cosmic
order. He is called "Ibis the Glorious," and "the Ibis who proceeded
from Ptah." Osiris, the dying and resurrected God, is identified with
him as "Osiris the Ibis, the Blessed One." Together with the moon god,
Xunsu and Máut, he is worshipped in the trinity Xunsu-Máut-Tehuti as the
"child ever being born again." <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_112)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

Among the Greeks, Tot was identified with Hermes, who now begins to play
a very prominent rôle as Hermes Trismegistos, the thrice great, the
saviour of souls. Hermes is now adored as the first-born son of Zeus,
and is even identified with the father of the gods as his representative
and plenipotentiary.

The philosophers of the time bear the stamp of their age. Thus Seneca,
Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and other pagan sages are kindred in spirit
to the Christian religion; they are under the influence of Platonism;
they object to the idolatry of polytheism and demand a

pure theism; they speak of the fatherhood of God; they insist upon
morality and are inclined to conceive the soul as distinct from, and
superior to, the body which is regarded as its temporal tabernacle, and
as the seat, if not cause, of all evil. Yet they are philosophers, not
pastors. They are too aristocratic to appreciate their kinship to
Christianity. They even show a contempt for the religion of the vulgar,
and they themselves appeal to the thinkers, not to the toilers, not to
the multitudes, not to the poor in spirit.

Græco-Egyptians developed a religious philosophy upon the basis of
ancient Egyptian traditions, compiled

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

in a book called the *Divine Pymander*, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_113) which contains many beautiful sayings
that remind us of Christian views; but the *Divine Pymander* (like other
philosophical books) is addressed to the few not to the many, and its
mysticism rendered it unfit to become the religion of mankind.

Apollonius of Tyana is a figure in many respects similar, but by no
means superior, to Jesus Christ. For in him the philosophy of the age
becomes a religion. His followers, however, were neither better nor
wiser than the early Christians; they shared with them the same
superstitions, cherishing the same trust in miracles, yet for all we
know, they had only few of their redeeming features.

Julian, surnamed by Christian authors the Apostate, is in spite of his
idealism a reactionary man who set his face against Christianity because
he recognised in the latter the most powerful representative of the
coming faith. This last pagan emperor, it is true, was a noble-minded
and thoughtful man who opposed Christianity mainly on account of its
shortcomings, its Jewish affiliations, and the narrowness of its
devotees, but he was enamored with the past, and his highest ambition
was to revive the barbarism of pagan institutions, which tendency
appears most plainly in his retention of bloody sacrifices, his esteem
for oracles and a general indulgence in the mysteries of Neo-Platonism.

The various schools of post-Christian gnosticism were in all probability
the most dangerous competitors of

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Christianity,
which explains the bitterness with which the Church-fathers revile
gnostic doctrines. But the gnostics were after all so similar to the
Christians that some Church-fathers use the name "Gnostic" as a synonym
for Christians. Gnostic teachers are looked upon less as strangers than
as heretics, and their speculations have been an important factor in the
development of Christian dogmas.

The gnostics, as a rule, represent the demiurge, i. e., the architect of
the world, whom they identify with the Jewish Yahveh, as the father of
all evil. They describe him as irascible, jealous, and revengeful, and
contrast him with the highest God who had nothing to do with the
creation. As the demiurge created the world, he has a right to it, but
he was overcome through the death of Jesus. The demiurge thought to
conquer Jesus when he let him die on the cross, but his triumph was
preposterous, for through the passion and death of the innocent Jesus
the victory of God was won and the salvation of mankind became
established.

One peculiarly interesting sect of gnostics is called the Ophites, or
serpent worshippers. The demiurge (so they hold), on recognising the
danger that might result from the emancipation of man through gnosis (i.
e., knowledge or enlightenment), forbade him to eat from the fruit of
the tree of knowledge. But the God, the highest Lord, the all-good and
all-wise Deity, took compassion on man and sent the serpent to induce
him to eat of the tree of knowledge so that he might escape the bondage
of ignorance in which Yahveh, the demiurge, tried to hold him.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

The serpent appears on many gnostic gems and is never missing in the
Mithras monuments. Frequently it is found on Christian devices where it
is sometimes difficult to interpret it as the representative of evil.

Irenaeus, an adversary of the gnostic view, replaced the demiurge by the
Devil, whom he regards as a rebel angel, having fallen by pride and
arrogance, envying God's creation (*Adv. hær.*, No. 40). He agrees,
however, with the gnostics, in that he maintains that the Devil had
claims upon man because of man's sin. Jesus,

however, having paid the debt of mankind, has the power to redeem the
souls of men from the clutches of the Devil who, by having treated a
sinless man as a sinner, became now himself a debtor of mankind.

This juridical theory of the death of Jesus and his relation to the
Devil was further elaborated by Origen. According to Origen the
sacrifice of Jesus is not rendered to make an atonement to God or
satisfy his feeling of justice (which is the Protestant conception), but
to pay off the Devil. Jesus is, as it were, a bait for the Devil. Satan
imagines he must destroy Jesus, but having succeeded

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

in killing him, finds out to his unspeakable regret that he has been
outwitted by the Lord. God had set a trap, and the Devil was foolish
enough to allow himself to be caught.

Manes, a man educated in the Zoroastrian faith, endeavored to found a
universal religion through the synthesis of all the religions he knew;
and because Manicheism, as this view is called, contains many Christian
elements, it is commonly regarded as a Christian or a gnostic sect, but
it was strongly denounced as heretical by St. Augustine. Manes taught
the Persian dualism,

but St. Augustine, who formulated the orthodox Christian doctrine
denying the independent existence of evil, explains the presence of sin
in the world by the free will with which Adam was endowed at creation,
and regards evil as a means to an end in God's plan of education.

Christianity triumphed over paganism, and it did so by embodying in its
fabric everything that in those days was regarded as true and good and
elevating. Thus the adoration of statues and images, at first so
vehemently denounced by Christians as heathenish, was reintroduced with
all the pagan methods of worship, the burning of

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

incense, processions, sprinkling with holy water, and other rituals. The
old symbol of the labarum was interpreted as the monogram of Christ; and
the sacred mark of two intersecting lines, a religious emblem of great
antiquity, was identified with the cross of Golgotha. The figure of two
intersecting lines was a mark of salvation among the Syrians and other
nations, and the probability is that it represented the four quarters of
the compass; <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_114) but now since is was
called a cross, it recovered in a higher degree its traditional
reputation as a powerful magic charm and was extensively used for
exorcisms. <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_115) There is no doctrine on
which the Christian fathers so thoroughly agree as on the belief that
the Devil is afraid of the cross.

The Greek gods were regarded as demons by the early Christians, but the
ideas which found expression in the mythology of Greece, in the tales of
Greek deities

and heroes, were retained and Christianised. The old Greek saviours
simply changed names and became Christian saints, or at least
contributed important features to the legends of their lives.

Christianity is a religion of peace, but the Western nations are
warlike, and at the very beginning of the Christian era the need was

consecrated by religious sentiment and represented in struggling saints
and angels.

The Christian patron saint of fighters is St. George, and it is natural
that the English, who among the Christian nations are not the least
pious and at the same time not the least belligerent, have chosen the
name of St. George for their battle-cry.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

The legend and pictures of St. George remind us strongly of the myths of
Perseus. In its Christian form the tale appears first in the *Legendæ
Sanctorum* of Jacobus de Voragine, who tells us of a pagan city, the
neighborhood of which was infested by a dragon that had to be appeased
by human sacrifices. The monster was finally slain by St. George, a
chivalrous Christian knight, who arrived at the moment the king's
daughter was offered as a victim. The princess, at the request of the
knight, tied her girdle round the dragon's neck, who now, although the
beast had been reported dead, rises and follows the virgin like a tame
lamb to the city. The people are frightened by the sight, but St. George
kills him once more, this time for good. St. George is richly rewarded,
but he distributes his wealth among the poor, converts the King and his
subjects to Christianity, and goes to another land, where he dies a
martyr's death.

The historical St. George, an archbishop of Alexandria and a follower of
Arius, possesses no features whatever of the heroic dragon-slayer of the
legend. According to the unanimous report of Christian and pagan
historians, he was an abject, cringing fellow, and when he had attained
the high position of archbishop, proved a cruel and extortionate tyrant
who was greatly hated by the people. He was deposed by the worldly
authorities and put in jail on Christmas eve, 361. But his enemies,
mostly poor people belonging to his diocese, grew tired of the delay of
the law; a mob broke open the prison doors and lynched the deposed
archbishop on January 17, 362. His violent death was later on regarded
as a sufficient title to the glory of the martyr's crown. The most

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

important service he rendered the Church consisted in the fact, that the
official recognition of an Arian saint helped to reconcile the followers
of Arius.

Gelarius seems to be the first Roman Catholic Pope who mentions St.
George, and he knows nothing of his life, but counts him among those
saints "who are better

known to God than to mankind." <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_118) It
is difficult to say whether His Holiness was conscious of the irony of
this passage.

It is an unsolved problem how St. George could have been identified with
the dragon-slaying deities of ancient

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

pagan mythologies. The connecting links are missing, but it is probable
that there is no deeper reason than a similarity in the sound of names.
Perhaps a solar deity was somewhere worshipped under the name γεωργός,
i. e., tiller of the ground, because the civilisation of agriculture
overcame the dragon of savage barbarism.

The final conqueror of the dragon, however, is not St. George, but the
Archangel Michael, who, on the day of judgment, plays the part of Zeus
defeating the giants and Typhaeus, or the Teuton God Thor, slaying the
Midgard serpent; and when the victory is gained Michael will hold the
balances in which the souls are weighed.

The belligerent spirit did not remain limited to Michael and St. George,
but was also imputed to other saints who proved their prowess in various
ways in their encounters with the Evil One. St. Anthony, of Egypt
(251-356), the founder of the Christian monastery system, is reported to
have battled with evil spirits in the desert near Thebes, whither he
withdrew from the world to practise severe penances. His heroic deeds,
which consist of frightful struggles with the demons of his imagination,
have been recorded by the good Bishop Athanasius, whose book on the
subject is of special interest because it contains an essay written by
St. Anthony himself, containing the gist of his wisdom and experience in
struggling with evil spirits. <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119) The
artistic genius of Salvator Rosa gave a concrete plausibility to the
story in a highly dramatic picture illustrating the combat in a critical

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

moment when only the cross saved the undaunted saint from defeat during
a daring onslaught of the fiend in his most horrible shape. (See the
illustration on page [236](#page_236).)

There can scarcely be any doubt that the original doctrine of Jesus of
Nazareth was an ethics of peace; not only peacefulness and gentleness of
mind in general, but peace at any price, and a non-resistance to evil.
The warlike spirit among later Christians and the worship of belligerent
archangels and saints were introduced into the writings of the early
Church from pagan sources and the importance of this phase of
Christianity grew with its expanse among the energetic races of the
North. The Teutonic nations, the Norsemen, the Germans, the Anglo-Saxons
and their kin, whose conversion is the greatest conquest Christianity
ever made, proved no less belligerent than the Greek and Roman, but they
were their superiors in strength, in generosity, in fairness toward
their enemies, and in purity of morals.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_79"></span>[195:1](hod13.htm#fr_80) The Christian Church
never lost sight of the idea that a human sacrifice is indispensable for
the expiation of sin, the atonement being procured by the mystic effects
of faith. Hence the constant reference of Christ's death on the cross to
both Abraham's offering of Isaac and the miraculous healing power of the
brazen serpent in the desert.

discovered a passage commenting on this or a similar picture in Achilles
Tatius, and explains it as follows: Andromeda, adorned as the bride of
death with girdle, crown, and veil, is tied to two poles. Above her
Cupid stands engaged with women in the preparation of a wedding.
Andromeda's old nurse hands her a twig. Behind and above the nurse are
guards with Phrygian caps and arms. On the left, Cassiopeia, Andromeda's
mother, who exhibits the vanity of which the legend accuses her, is
seated in conversation with her servants. Underneath Perseus fights the
monster, which scene is witnessed by three Nereids, one riding on a
sea-horse, one on a dolphin, and the third resembling the typical figure
of Scylla. The monster differs here from the typical Medusa figure.

horse Pegasus is not as yet endowed with wings, which became very soon
its never-missing attributes. The modern notion that Pegasus is the
symbol of poetical enthusiasm only dates back to the fifteenth century
of our era, and was foreign to the Greek.

an owl, witnesses the scene. Over the cave, the sungod, Helios, and the
goddess of the moon, Selene, drive past in their chariots. Whether the
sacrifice of the bull was practised or only commemorated is not known.
Concerning the significance of the Mithras mysteries little is known,
except that initiations were by penances, fasts, self-mortifications,
lustrations, and water and fire probations. Baptism was practised, and
Mithras was called the mediator for the remission of sin. The most
important references besides the monuments are passages in Justin
Martyr, Apol., I., 66, and Tertullian, *Praescr. haeret.*, 40. The
Mithras cult had many votaries among the Roman soldiery garrisoned in
the northern provinces.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[222:1](hod13.htm#fr_97) The mysteries of
Mithras were introduced into Greece at the time of Alexander. They
gained more and more influence until they reached a climax in the second
century of the Christian era, Most of the many monuments which the
Mithras worship left all over the Roman empire, especially in Gallia and
Germany, date from this period when it had almost become a rival of
Christianity.

Gentiles concur in this mode of speech. And this should willingly be
accepted by us, because with the birth of the Saviour there comes not
only the salvation of mankind, but the brightness of the sun itself is
renewed."

<span id="fn_101"></span>[223:5](hod13.htm#fr_102) "But they call it the
birthday of the Invincible (i. e., Mithras). Who, however, is invincible
if not our Lord, who has conquered death? Further, if they say 'it is
the birthday of the sun,' He is the sun of righteousness, about whom the
prophet Malachi says, 'Unto you that fear my name shall the sun of
righteousness arise with healing in his wings.'" Observe in this passage
that the prophet <span id="page_224">p. 224</span> thinks of the sun of
God after the Babylonian and Egyptian fashion, as having wings which are
of a wholesome or healing influence.

The preceding lines of this quotation from Chrysostom (Hom. 31) plainly
state that Christ's birthday has been fixed upon the day of the birth of
Mithras: "On this day (the birthday of Mithras) also the birthday of
Christ was lately fixed at Rome in order that whilst the heathen were
busied with their profane ceremonies, the Christians might perform their
holy rites undisturbed."

<span id="fn_102"></span>[224:1](hod13.htm#fr_103) "Some to whom this
day of our celebration is worthy of honor not so much on account of the
birth of Christ as for the sake of the renewal of the sun."

<span id="fn_103"></span>[224:2](hod13.htm#fr_104) "But no other day
appears to us more appropriate than to-day for worshipping in heaven and
earth the Feast of the Nativity, and while even in the material world
(in the elements) a new light shines, He confers on us before our very
senses, the brightness of His wonderful sacrament."

<span id="fn_104"></span>[224:3](hod13.htm#fr_105) "Why does the sun
already leave the circle of the arctic north?  
Is not Christ born upon the earth who will the path of light increase?

<span id="fn_105"></span>[224:4](hod13.htm#fr_106) "Truly, after the
solstice, when Christ is born in the body,  
With a new sun he will change the frigid days of the north wind.  
While he is offering to mortals the birth that will bring them
salvation,  
Christ with the progress of days gives command that the nights be
declining."

<span id="fn_106"></span>[225:1](hod13.htm#fr_107) "No one shall
celebrate the 1st of January and the Brumalia."

<span id="fn_107"></span>[225:2](hod13.htm#fr_108) The statue here
reproduced was found in the Mithraeum of Ostia, where C. Valerius
Heracles and his sons dedicated it in the year 190 A. D.; it was figured
for the first time by Layard in his *Recherches sur Mithra*, Plate LXX.
Similar statues are found in various Mithras caves.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[226:1](hod13.htm#fr_109) Abrak is Egyptian,
and means "bow down" or "adore." The word occurs in the Bible, Gen. 41,
43. Sas (standing for *Sadshi*) means "name." Abraxas is the name to be
adored. (See King, *The Gnostics*, p. 36.)

<span id="fn_109"></span>[227:1](hod13.htm#fr_110) The inscription
reads, "Gabriel Sabaoth," i. e., The strong God Zebaoth. The second Ρ
(i. e., *R*) is a mistake which the stone cutter made for Λ (i. e.,
*L*).

Bellermann, in his remarks on Abraxas-gems, in a "Programm des Grauen
Klosters" (Berlin, 1817-1819) describes the gem. The priest of Abraxas
carries a serpent coiled up in the form of a ring, and a lance round
which entwines another serpent. His head is crowned by a strange
head-dress of four feathers (presumably of the Phœnikopteros) and
surrounded by three stars.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[227:2](hod13.htm#fr_111) From C. W. King. The
first line of the inscription is between Χ crosses; it is explained to
mean "I am the Good Spirit, the Eternal Sun."

<span id="fn_111"></span>[229:1](hod13.htm#fr_112) See Socrates, *Eccl.
Hist.*, 5, 17, which report is repeated by Sozomenes.

Hermes Trismegistos, p. 7.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[231:1](hod13.htm#fr_114) The term "Pymander"
is commonly explained to mean ποιμὴν ἀνδροῶν, i. e., shepherd of man."

<span id="fn_114"></span>[235:1](hod13.htm#fr_115) The equilateral cross
of Paganism is frequently, though not always, ornamented with four dots,
one in each corner. We believe we are not mistaken when we interpret the
dots as emblems of the sun in its four respective positions, in the
east, south, west and north. Egyptian wall-pictures show the Apis
covered with this sacred symbol, (see e. g. Lenormant, *L'Hist. Anc. de
l'Orient*, V., 183,) and it serves as a not uncommon pattern on the
dresses of various Greek deities.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[235:2](hod13.htm#fr_116) For further details
see the author's articles on *The Cross, Its History and Significance*
in *The Open Court*, 1899 and 1900. Their publication in book form is
contemplated by The Open Court Publishing Co.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[235:3](hod13.htm#fr_117) From Egyptian
monuments of the eighteenth dynasty. (After Wilkinson.) The same use of
the cross, as an amulet worn round the neck, was made in Greece, as we
know from ancient pictures, published by Gerhard.

Sanctorum* of the Bolandists for January 17, which is observed as St.
Anthony's day. In addition there are several Latin translations of St.
Anthony's letters extant in the *Biblioteca Patrum*.
