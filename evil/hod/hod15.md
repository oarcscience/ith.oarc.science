# THE DEVIL'S PRIME.

*Miracles and Magic*.

A LATIN proverb says: "*Si duo faciunt idem, non est idem*" (if two do
the same thing, it is not the

same thing); and this is true not only of individuals, but also of
nations and of religions. It is a habit common

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

among all classes of people to condone the faults of their own kind but
to be severe with those of others. The oracles of Delphi were divine to
a Greek mind, but they were of diabolical origin according to the
judgment of Christians. Jesus was a magician in the eyes of the pagans,
while the Christians worshipped him as the son of God, and a man who
performed miracles.

</span>

The priests of Pharaoh and Moses perform the same tricks still performed
by the snake charmers of Egypt and India, but the deeds of Moses alone
are regarded as miracles, and the Israelites claim that he could
accomplish more than the Egyptians. Father Juan Bautista (of about 1600)
tells us that among the natives of Mexico

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

there are magicians who "conjure the clouds, and can make a stick look
like a serpent, a mat like a centipede, a stone like a scorpion, and
similar deceptions." <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130)

Simon Magus and his disciples were believed by the early Christians to
possess power over demons; <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_131) but
Simon was a competitor of the Apostles, and therefore his deeds were not
regarded as divine. Before an impartial tribunal the methods and
aspirations of both parties would

resemble one another more than the one-sided statements of Christian
authors at first sight seem to warrant. The accusation made against
Simon by Luke, of having offered money to the Apostles for communicating
to him the Holy Ghost, does not prove a depravity of heart, as the later
Christians thought; for Simon took the rebuke

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

in the proper spirit and apparently remained on good terms with the
Apostles. The reports of the church fathers which make Peter and Simon
rivals in working miracles, develop the story in the spirit of the age;
they characterise the superstitions of the time; yet, although they
probably reflect historical facts, they are as unreliable as are the
charges of pagan authors hurled against the Christians.

The early Christians practised healing the sick by the laying on of
hands and by praying; so did the Therapeutæ and other Gnostics; yet
faith-cure and Christian science are not countenanced by the churches
to-day.

Minucius Felix <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133) puts the common
notions, which in his days prevailed in Greece and Italy concerning the
practices of the Christians, into the mouth of Cæcilius who describes
them as a desperate class of vulgar men and credulous women threatening
the welfare of mankind. He states that they are atheists, for they
cherish a contempt for temples, spit at the gods, and ridicule religious
ceremonies; that their own cult is a mixture of superstition and
depravity; that they possess secret symbols by which they recognise one
another; they call themselves brothers and sisters, and degrade these
sacred words by sensuality. Further, it is said that they adore a
donkey's head, and that their worship is obscene. The libel culminates
in the assertion that the reception of new members is celebrated by
slaughtering and devouring a child covered all over with flour, which is
an obvious perversion of the Communion, but Cæcilius declares that it

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

is done because partnership in guilt is the best means of securing
secrecy. Lastly, he adds, that on festival days they celebrate love
feasts which after the extinction of the lights end with sexual
excesses.

Similar accusations are found in various authors, and even the
noble-hearted and high-minded Tacitus speaks of the Christians with
contempt; while on the other hand the Christians do not shrink from
ridiculing the holiest and noblest of paganism. For instance, Minucius
Felix, a Christian of the highest type and best education, speaks of
Socrates as "the Athenian buffoon." <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_134)

Justinus Martyr in his *Apologia* makes the asseveration that the
Christians are innocent, but leaves the question open whether the
heretics, such as the Gnostics, might not be guilty of these
abominations (App. II., p. 70), and Eusebius directly claims that the
practices that prevailed among the heretics were the direct cause of the
evil rumors concerning the life of the Christians.

While we must bear in mind that the moral rigidity of the Gnostics
leaves upon the whole no doubt about the purity of their life, we may
grant the probability of the presence of black sheep among them. But the
same is true of the Christians, as we know for certain on the good
authority of St. Paul who in his First Epistle to the Corinthians, after
an enumeration of such sinners as will not inherit the kingdom (v.
8-11,--the passage had better remain unquoted) says, "and such were some
of you." Accordingly, there can be no doubt that there were abuses in
the Church of Corinth. St. Paul believes the rumor of a sin, "that is
not so much as named among

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

the Gentiles," and the Second Epistle is the best evidence that the
Corinthians did not deny the facts. They repent, whereupon St. Paul
recommends charity toward the main offender (2 Cor. ii. 6-11), saying:
"To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also."

The various aberrations among the Christians which

<span class="small">(See pp. [268](#page_268)-[269](#page_269))</span>

were very apparent in many of their most prominent leaders, such as
Constantine the Great, must not astonish us, because Christianity
originated in an age of unrest, and the new movement was the centre of
attraction for all kinds of eccentricity. In spite of various
excrescences, we cannot but say that Christianity opened to the world

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

new vistas of truth. Represented by such men as St. Paul, it tended
toward purity of heart; but the same is true of the Gnostics and the
Manichees. The accusations on both sides rest mainly upon partisan
statements and cannot be trusted, or at least must be used with due
reserve. But it is natural that here as always, the same things are no
longer the same when reported of people of another faith. Thus the
virtues of the pagans are to St. Augustine only "polished vices," and
the heroism of Christian martyrs is mere obstinacy in the opinion of
Roman prætors.

We look with contempt upon the Indian prophet who poses as a rain-maker,
but read the story of Elijah with great edification, and while we
justify the holy zeal of the latter, we would make no allowance for the
severity of Indian reformers who fail to spare the lives of their
rivals. One instance will suffice: Tenskwatawa, the Shawano prophet,
preached in the beginning of the nineteenth century a nobler religion
and a purer morality to the tribes of the prairie, and was revered by
his followers as an incarnation of Manabozho

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (i. e., first
doer). Drunkenness, the besetting sin of the Indians since their
acquaintance with the whites, and the traditional superstition practised
by the medicine-men ceased. But reform was coupled with persecution.
Tenskwatawa "inaugurated a crusade against all who were suspected of
dealing in witchcraft or magic arts," and he took advantage of the faith
of his followers "to effectually rid himself of all who opposed his
sacred claims." All his rivals were successively marked by the prophet,
and doomed to be burned alive. <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136)

 <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137)

All these facts are so many instances which prove the truth of the
proverb, that if two do the same thing it will not be regarded as the
same thing: and thus the miracle of our own religion is mere magic and
witchcraft in other religions.

\*      <sup>\*</sup>      \*

One of the most characteristic features of the pre-scientific age is
man's yearning for the realisation of that which is unattainable by
natural means. The belief in

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

magic will inevitably prevail so long as the dualistic world-conception
dominates the minds of the people, and in that period of civilisation
supernatural deeds are expected as the indispensable credentials of all
religious prophets. It is the age of miracles and witchcraft.

Now we know that wherever contra-natural things are believed, there the
strangest events will be experienced by those who are under the
suggestion of the, belief; and then at once a competition will originate
between those who represent the established religion and others who
perform, or pretend to perform, similar deeds. The former are prophets
and saints, and they work miracles; the latter are wizards and witches,
and their art is called witchcraft.

Miracles and witchcraft possess this in common that both are supposed to
supersede the laws of nature, but there is this difference that the
miracle is believed to be the supernatural power of one's own religion,
while witchcraft is the miracle of heretics. Miracle is anything
contra-natural that is legitimate; and witchcraft is the same thing, but
illegitimate; the former is supposed to be done with the help of God,
the latter with the help of Satan; the former is boasted of as the
highest glory of the Church, the latter is denounced as the greatest
abomination possible.

It is natural that wizards and witches are always represented as
obnoxious, and it is said that their art is practised to injure the
welfare of mankind. Nevertheless, miracles, <span

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

good deeds if only performed by believers in other gods are branded as
witchcraft. Moreover, all priests are unanimous in condemning the
application of charms and spells, except those of their own religion,
even though they be used for the best and purest ends. A faith-cure by
heretics, and even a successful operation through the unusual skill of a
surgeon, would be set down as deeds of darkness by those who believe in
a religion of miracles, <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139) but
official processions with prayers and sprinkling of holy water are still
employed, as could be observed during a late small-pox epidemic in
French Canada.

The belief in magic is a natural phase in the evolution of mankind,
producing the medicine-man who dispels diseases by charms, the prophet
who by an appeal to his Deity (be it the sun-god of the American
Indians, or the Baal of the Phœnicians, or El or Yahveh of the
Israelites) undertakes to make rain, and the medium who vaticinates or
foretells fortunes and calls the dead from Spirit-Land.

The rain-priests play a most important part in the life of all the
American Indians. The snake-dance among the Pueblo Indians of Mexico is
a prayer for rain. <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_140) Frequently the
sun is invoked for rain. Dreams, visions, and ecstasies are regarded as
the best means of divine revelation, and the medicine-bag possesses
magic powers. The devotional spirit is not less intense among, the

All attempt to practise magic, and a religion that promises success in
life and proposes to accomplish the salvation of man by miracles, be it
the miracles of their founders or the continued miracles of Church
institutions, such as sacraments, pilgrimages, sprinkling of holy water,
mass-reading, or other rites supposed to possess other than a purely
symbolical significance, is a religion of magic. In brief, a religion of
magic is based on a belief in the contra-natural, and as soon as a
religion of magic becomes an established institution, it will develop
the notion of witchcraft by a discrimination between its own miracles
and those of other people who are unbelievers.

How similar the notions of legitimate and illegitimate miracles are, may
be learned from the writings of

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agrippa of
Nettesheim (1486-1535), one of the greatest sages and philosophers of
the age of the Reformation, who proclaimed that the perfection of
philosophy could be attained by magic, which in distinction to black
magic <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_142) he called "natural" or
"celestial" magic, and which, he assumed, leads to a perfect union with
God. His book, *De Occulta Philosophia*, written in 1510 but published
only in 1531, exhibits his belief in the possibility of creating hatred
and love by spells, of discovering thieves, confounding armies, making
thunderstorms and rain, all of which he expects to accomplish by magic
through a mystical union with God. It is difficult for us to understand
how a man of his caliber could believe in the efficacy of spells and
mystic keys; but grant the reality of magic, and such aberrations become
legitimate experiments. Witches have been frequently accused of the very
same feats, only they were said to have performed them through the
assistance of the Devil. In spite of the resemblance which Agrippa
unconsciously had discovered between witchcraft and miracles, he
remained unmolested, for his views were at the time commonly accepted.
Nor would he ever have excited the hostility of the Papal party had he
not lectured with fervor, at the University of Dôle, Burgundy (1509), on
Reuchlin's book, *De Verbo Mirifico*, and had he not, in 1519, when
syndic at Metz, ventured to save the life of a witch that had fallen
into the hands of the Inquisitor Nicolas Savini. <span

What a strange mixture of occultism with exact observation,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

based upon anatomical measurements, is contained in the chapter on "The
Proportions of the Human Body." Mathematics, natural science, and
mysticism are all combined in Agrippa's *Occulta Philosophia*, and the
learned author is unable to discriminate between facts and fancy. <span

Agrippa's celestial magic is not different from black magic; for both
kinds of magic consist in the hope of contra-natural accomplishments.
When after years of varied disappointments Agrippa discovered that there

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

was no magic, be it black or white, he came to the conclusion that there
was no science. As the agnostic who, after having wrongly formulated the
problems of philosophy, and finding his mind hopelessly entangled in
confusion, pronounces the dreary doctrine of the impossibility of
knowledge, so Agrippa of Nettesheim began to despair

not only of magic, but also of science; and he wrote, in 1526, his

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

All in all, we find that a religion of magic involves a belief in
witchcraft. Where sacraments are employed as exorcisms, every attempt at
exercising extraordinary powers is regarded not as impossible but as a
lack of loyalty. Hence heresy and witchcraft are always declared to be
closely allied, for witchcraft is nothing but the performance of
miracles without the licence of an established Church, which claims to
have a monopoly in supernaturalism.

 <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146)

The belief in and the prosecution of witchcraft are the necessary result
of a firmly established religion of magic. All the religions of magic
are naturally intolerant. As soon as one of them triumphs over its
rivals, as soon as it is worked out into a systematic creed and
organised in an institution such as the Church, it will,

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

like all combinations or trusts, with all means at its command, insure
and perpetuate its supremacy. Considering that the mediæval Church was
practically a religion of magic, witch prosecution was the inevitable
result of the Pope's ascendancy, and it continued in Protestant
countries as an heirloom of the Dark Ages so long as the belief in magic
was retained.

*Exorcism*.

The belief in Satan as held by many Christians today is harmless and
tame in comparison with the old conception, which was taken seriously.
Satan, it is true, was regarded as the foe of mankind, but there was no
doubt about his power, and the idea prevailed that his services could
easily be procured by those ready to surrender to him their souls.

As soon as the Church became possessed of power, it was at once bent on
the suppression of magic and witchcraft. Constantine began the policy of
threatening the severest punishment on all kinds of black art, allowing
its application only for curing diseases and preventing hail and rain
storms during the harvest. And Constantine's successors did not fail to
preserve the tradition.

A prohibition to fish implies that there is good fishing, which tempts
many to try. In the same way, the policy of the Christian authorities
was tantamount to an official recognition of witchcraft as a mighty and
powerful weapon that could be wielded by the initiated both for good and
for evil; and thus it could not fail to strengthen the Devil's credit,
as well as to develop most

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

exuberantly a peculiar mediaeval demonology. Belief in witchcraft
rapidly became so common that almost all countries were in possession of
laws against magicians, soothsayers, and witches. One remarkable
exception only is found in the law-code of the Lombards, which contains
the declaration that witches cannot perform any such feats as devouring
people alive, and therefore the burning of a woman on the pretext of her
being a witch is prohibited.

There is a remarkable Latin book of "Dialogues on the Life and Miracles
of the Italian Fathers," <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_147) which
characterises the superstitious spirit that prevailed among both the
laity and the clergy. It is replete with all kinds of ridiculous tales
which are taken in good earnest. We are told, for instance, that Gregory
the Great, when consecrating an Arian church for Roman Catholic worship,
successfully exorcised the Devil with the help of sacred relies; Satan
flew before him in the shape of a huge pig and vacated the place
completely the following night with great noise.

The Devil came more and more into prominence in the eighth and ninth
centuries. Baptism was regarded as an expulsion of the evil spirit. The
convert had, according to Dionysius, to exhale three times, and
according to the Greek euchologion, also to spit at him upon the floor.
The Synod of Leptinæ in the year 743 added to the confession of faith an
"abrenunciation" of the Devil.

A Low-German formula which renounces the three

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_148) consists of questions and answers, which
read as follows:

The fact is that Christianity itself was regarded as a kind of magic
which in distinction to the black magic or necromancy would have to be
classed together with white

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

magic. The sacraments were supposed to be miraculous methods of
performing supernatural feats quite analogous to exorcisms, and the
church itself was, in the minds of the people, an institution of sacred
sorcery.

*Belief in Witchcraft*.

With the belief in witchcraft a new period begins in the evolution of
mankind. The Devil becomes greater and more respected than ever; indeed,
this is the classical period of his history and the prime of his life.
Contracts were made with the Devil in which men surrendered their souls
for all kinds of services on his part.

In the thirteenth century the Devil reached the acme of his influence,
and it is only possible to give a meagre sketch of the Devil's activity
during this period. Nothing extraordinary could happen without its being
attributed to him, and to the people of the Middle Ages many things,
ordinary to us, were very extraordinary.

Gervasius Tilberiensis composed a collection of stupid fables which he
published in 1211 under the title *Otia Imperialia*, dedicating them to
Emperor Otto IV. He repeats some spook stories of Apuleius as events
that happened in France and England and invents new tales which surpass
the old ones only in crudity. He accepts the medical explanation of
nightmares as due to an overheated imagination, but proves even then the
presence of demoniacal influence, on the authority of St. Augustine.

The book is written mainly for the instruction of young monks. The
initials of the original editions are emblazoned with pious pictures,
and the tendency of all stories is that there is no surer salvation than
in the brotherhood of the Cistercian monks, the order to which the
author belongs. He declares that "there is no safer road than the order
of the Cistercians; nor do fewer people go down to the lower regions
than the members of that religion." <span

sovereign who regards it as his duty to protect his faithful servants
and takes an interest in concealing their crimes. He works a special
miracle, lest the slander of a clergyman become public (Book I., p. 23).
The Devil having caused a man to sin against the sixth commandment, is
unable to accuse and punish the sinner, or make his guilt known, because
the latter escapes all evil effects through the confessional (Book III.,
p. 4). The Devil once went to a confessor and confessed. Having
enumerated his sins, the confessor declared that a thousand years would
not have sufficed to commit them all, and the Devil

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

answered that indeed he was much older than a thousand years, for he was
one of the demons who fell with Lucifer. The priest considered his sins
unpardonable, and asked him whether he wanted to do penance. "Yes," he
said, "if the penance is not too heavy for me." "Well," replied the
confessor, "bow down thrice a day, saying: 'God, my Lord and Creator, I
have sinned against thee;

forgive me." "No, said the Devil," that would be too humiliating for me
(III., 26, and IV., 5).

Arrogance and self-conceit are the main-springs of Satan's character. A
curious parallel to Peregrinus is the story of a woman who, for the sake
of clearing her soul of sin, burns herself to death (Book VI., p. 35).
Imps are seen playing with cupids upon the train of a

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

gentlewoman (Book. V., p. 7). A man games with the Devil and loses his
soul (V., 34).

The theory of incubi and succubi is presented in all its indecency on
the authority of St. Thomas Aquinas, who in his commentary on Job (Chap.
40) interprets Behemoth (a large animal, probably the elephant) as the
Devil, and derives from the mention of the animal's sexual strength
(verse 16) the theory that evil demons can have intercourse with human
beings. Satan is supposed to serve first as a succubus (or female devil)
to men, and then as an incubus (or male devil) to women; and St. Thomas
declares that children begotten in this way ought to be regarded as the
children of the men whom Satan served as succubus. They would, however,
The more cunning than normal children on account of the demoniacal
influence to which they were exposed in their pre-natal condition.
Matthæus Paris mentions that within six months one such incubus-baby
developed all its teeth and attained the size of a boy of seven years,
while his mother became consumptive and died.

The superstitions of the belief in the personal interference of the
Devil with human affairs passed away, but they left us an extensive and
interesting literature which for all time to come will remain a rich
mine for the anthropologist, the antiquarian, the historian, the
psychologist, the poet, and the philosopher. There are innumerable
miracles and tales of St. Mary, the mother of Jesus, but few of them are
endurable, while the general tone of the narration is unworthy of any
woman,--let alone the highest woman-ideal of Christianity. A dog has
been baptised by rascals, and he turns mad (X., 145). In the

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

hour of death, pious people see the heavens open, while infidels are
tortured by black men, ravens and vultures (XL); and for the edification
of the faithful the damned are thrown into the crater of a volcano
(XII.).

The Abbot Richalmus, who wrote about 1270 a book of revelations about
the intrigues and persecutions of demons, recognises the Devil's hand in
every little inconvenience he might happen to experience. It is devils
that make him feel qualmish when he has eaten too much; they make him
fall asleep over his breviary. When he exposes his hand, they make it
feel chilly; when he hides it under his cloak, they tickle and bite it
like fleas. "Once, he says, "when we were gathering stones for building
a wall, I heard a devil exclaim, 'What tiresome work!' He only did it to
tempt us and make us rebellious." There is no noise but some devil
speaks out of it. "While I pull my sleeve," he says, "a rustling is
heard, and devils speak through this sound. When I scratch myself, the
scratching is their voice. . . . Lowly people are mostly seduced by
anger and sadness, but the rich and powerful by arrogance and
pride." <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_154)

Another favorite conception of Christianity originated in the Roman idea
of looking upon religion as a legal affair. It must have been a lawyer
who made that happy hit of presenting the case of Satan versus mankind
or *versus* Christ juridically, in the form of a regular lawsuit, in
which, of course, Satan in the end is worsted. The booklet, which bears
the title *Processus Sathanæ*, became so popular that it was repeatedly
edited by various authors and is still extant in various redactions, one

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

of the best and oldest being by Bartolus, a lawyer who lived
1313-1355. <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_155)

The Devil played the rôle of a joker in the Passion plays, and his part
became more and more prominent. In France the idea prevailed that the
great mysteries should always have not less than four devils, a usage
which is mentioned in Rabelais. Hence the proverb, "*Faire le diable à
quatre*." In Mediæval mysteries God the Father, God the Son, and Satan
appear on the stage, and

the last one is practically the main actor in the whole drama. He was
the intriguer who, after his successful revolution against the Lord, set
up an empire of his own in Hell; and without the Devil's intrigues the
whole plot of man's fall and Christ's salvation would be
impossible. <span id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_157) The works of Cæsarius,
of Heisterbach, Richalmus,

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bartolus, and
others are by no means the only ones that treat on devil-lore; they are
typical of a large class of similar literary productions.

While the Church in her struggles for supremacy, aspiring for worldly
power, began to neglect her spiritual duties, people sought comfort in
sects. The Manichees increased, Catharism spread rapidly and many new
sects, such as the Albigenses, were founded. Almost all sectarians were
morally earnest and sincere, yet the general character of these sects
was similar to the Manichees, an openly avowed dualism. The tendencies
of the time were dualistic, and the Church also was under the influence
of dualistic views. Nevertheless, orthodox Christianity, at least in her
noblest expositors, such as Thomas Aquinas and other Christian
philosophers, never lost sight of the monistic ideal, in spite of all
its demonological errors. The demonology of the Middle Ages was at
bottom a mythical excrescence, for the Devil's power was all the time
regarded as a mere sham, as *Blendwerk*. He still served the higher
purposes of the omnipotent God, who used him for his wise and
well-calculated ends. Thus it was a natural consequence that the Devil
appeared in spite of his smartness as the dupe of God; his fate was
always to be defeated and ridiculed. As such he figures in the
mysteries, the Easter and Christmas plays, in which he acts one of the
most important parts, that of intriguer, harlequin, and fool.

*Kindred Superstitions*.

Belief in witchcraft was only the main result of the established
authority of a religion of magic, involving the

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

belief in a personal Devil. There are other consequences which, though
less important, are sometimes bad enough in themselves. We mention a few
of them: (1) There were persons who actually tried to make contracts
with the Devil. (2) People possessed of a lively imagination began to
dream that they stood in all kinds of relations to the Evil One. There
are cases in which imaginary witches surrendered themselves voluntarily
to the Inquisition. (3) Soldiers entertained the hope of rendering
themselves bullet-proof. (4) Many methods were devised

to predict the future. (5) There were plenty of fools who tried to
become rich by magic; and (6) worst of all, men who knew better than the
self-constituted guardians of the right faith, were relentlessly
persecuted even unto death.

The Devil was believed to hold court and to celebrate witches' sabbaths,
on which occasions homage was paid him and the Christian sacraments were
travestied with diabolical malice.

The most remarkable case of bestial demonolatry with all its incidental
crimes, is recorded in the annals of

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> France where Giles
De Rais (also spelled Raiz and Retz) one of the greatest dignitaries of
the State, a descendant of the highest noble families of Brittany, and a
marshal of France, was charged with kidnapping about one hundred and
fifty women and children, who, after being subjected to all kinds of
outrages, were solemnly sacrificed to Satan. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158) The facts seem impossible but the
complete records of the case are still extant, according to which Rais
was convicted and executed in 1440. The history of his life has
apparently contributed to the formation of the legend of Bluebeard.

Among the persons who gave themselves up to the Inquisition we mention
Katharine Jung of Amdorf, Hessia, who confessed to her own father that
she was a witch. The poor man regarded it as his duty to denounce her,
and after ten days, on May, 11, 1631, the girl was executed.

Another case of comparatively recent date happened in Alvebrode,
Hanover. An old spinster, daughter of the widow Steingrob, had a brother
who suffered from attacks of asthma. Her mother was blind and lame, and
her sister had died of consumption. Some people in the village suggested
that the attacks which came upon her brother were due to witchcraft, and
at last the old spinster herself declared she was a witch and described
her relations with the Devil in the minutest terms. She was convinced
herself that she had bewitched her mother and sister and could injure
people by a mere glance. Anxious about the welfare of the villagers, she
warned them to avoid her, and tried to drown herself during an attack of
melancholy,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

but she was rescued and imprisoned. The physician, a sensible and humane
man, declared, judging from bodily symptoms, that she suffered from a
disease which had confused her mind, but she could not be prevailed upon
to submit to treatment. She insisted that she was as healthy as a fish
and that the Devil could not be driven out by medicine. She said: "It is
in vain to try to cure a witch. I deserve death and shall gladly die,
but please do not burn me, have me dispatched with the sword. Everything
will be well when I am dead." Thereupon the physician resorted to a
stratagem. He persuaded her that her neck was sword-proof, and succeeded
in inducing her to take medicine to make her neck soft again for
decapitation. She was then treated according to the prescriptions of her
physician, with bodily exercise and regular diet and sleep until her
mind improved, and she forgot all about witchcraft and her sword-proof
neck.

Christian Elsenreiter, a student of Passau, palmed off upon credulous
soldiers for making them bullet-proof a slip of paper upon which he
wrote, "Devil help me, body and soul I give to thee!" The paper had to
be swallowed, and Elsenreiter claimed that he who would die of it within
twenty-four hours would go to hell, but he who survived would be
bullet-proof all his life.

A Saxon Colonel had been hit twice during his military career by a
bullet, but in each case a Mansfeld-Thaler had protected him. This
incident gave rise to the notion that Mansfeld-Thalers make one
bullet-proof, and there was no officer in the imperial army during the
Turkish wars who did not carry at least one of them about

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

his person. The price of Mansfeld-Thalers at that time was fifteen times
their face value.

the pentagram, and the signs of the planets are preferred; but other
figures, such as squares, hexagrams, circles, and fantastic combinations
of irregular lines are also quite frequent. Conjurations were made

sometimes by partaking of the holy communion at church, and when at last
he failed to find the treasure or to accomplish his purpose, whatever it
may have been, he had reason to believe that he made some trifling

The most fashionable method of predicting the

the seventeenth century as a means of making a living. Kepler, who
enjoyed the confidence of the superstitious Emperor Rudolf IL, felt the
deep humiliation of his position, but he bore it with good humor, as we
know from himself. He writes:

"A knight was stricken by poverty great,  
    His goods he all had wasted,  
And gone from him was his whole estate;  
    Such bitter want he'd tasted  
        That to take his life he intended.

"He rode to the forest dark and dim,  
    But there, the Devil awaited  
The knight and said to him  
    'Thou shalt be reinstated  
        If thou wilt assist me in secret.'

"'I'll give thee chests full of glittering gold  
    In exchange for thy loving maiden,  
Then canst thou live well and free and bold,  
    Until thou diest. Well laden  
        With joys shalt thou be while living.'

"And happy was the maiden fair,

'But say, my Lord,' she asked, from where  
    Do the riches come?' Then affrighted  
        Was the knight at her look and her query.

    Through a forest green and pleasant?  
The birds of the forest there play in glee,  
    And the songs are now heard incessant  
        Which gaily the birds are singing.'

"Together a green forest they reached;  
    And near the road was standing  
A little chapel, where men beseeched  
    Mary, whose arms were expanding  
        To all: our worthy mother, our lady.

"To the knight the maiden said: Let me  
    Here stop in pious feeling <span id="page_299">p. 299</span>  
In the chapel to pray an Ave Marie.'  
    At the altar she was kneeling  
        With her arms acrosswise folded.

"She there fell asleep, forgetting her care,  
    And Mary stepped forth from the altar  
And to the knight she came blooming fair,  
    In her hand bearing rosary and psalter,  
        And mounted, as if 'twere the maiden.

"They both reached soon, in the forest dense,  
    The cross-road where the Devil was standing,  
His rage on seeing them was intense.  
    'Thou hast cheated me!' he was demanding,  
        'Thou treacherous liar, thou trickster!

'Thou hast promised to bring here thy lady fair,  
    And thou bringest the *Queen of Heaven!*  
With her I cannot my conquests share,  
    From her presence I must be driven  
        Yea, driven from her forever.'

              "Said Mary:

To thy fellows thou shalt be given,  
The lady thou must leave with me!  
    My Son's kingdom she shall live in,

What charms the idea of magic exercises upon a man's mind may be learned
from the fact that even Goethe, one of the clearest-headed men of modern
times, passed through a period of his life (as we know from his
*Wahrheit und Dichtung*) in which he pondered upon the possibility of
occultism. Reminiscences of this kind found classical expression in his
ballad "The Treasure

account of its practical beauty and sound moral lesson deserves to be
translated and quoted. <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_166) The

Poverty is of curses greatest,

And to end my sore depression

'Thine my soul be at thy pleasure!'  
I wrote down with my own blood.

"Circle within circle drawing,  
Wondrous flames I then collected  
Unto herbs and bones, selected,  
And conjured a spell of might,  
Then in manner overawing,  
As I'd learned, I dug for treasure  
On the spot I found by measure.  
Black and stormy was the night.

"And I saw a light's formation  
Brightening to a star's consistence,  
Coming from the farthest distance  
Just as struck the midnight hour.  
Vain was further preparation,  
And a beauteous youth, with glowing  
Splendor from a cup o'erflowing

The height of folly that the belief in a religion of magic is capable
of, was actually attained in the persecution of men of science whose
doctrines came in conflict with tradition. Not only religious reformers,
like Savonarola and Huss, were condemned to be burned alive and to die a
heretic's death, but also thinkers like Giordano Bruno. Galileo at the
age of seventy was imprisoned and surrendered to the Inquisition at the
demand of Pope Urban. Threatened with torture, he was forced to recant
publicly the heresy of the motion of the earth. <span

witch-prosecution with all kindred superstitions, among which the hatred
of science was not the least injurious to true religion and the highest
interests of mankind.

The belief in witchcraft ceased naturally with the ascendancy of
science. The more Christianity became imbued with the scientific spirit
of the eighteenth century, the rarer became the fagot, and the fires
were at last extinguished forever. So long as Christianity was
interpreted as a religion of magic, nothing could stop the terrible
mania for burning witches, neither the fear of future punishments for
the tortures inflicted upon many innocent victims, nor the pangs of
conscience that were now and then felt by the judges, nor Christian
charity and love. There was only one remedy, viz., a clear insight into
the nature of things revealing the impossibility of witchcraft; but that
one remedy afforded an unfailing cure.

p. 652: "The contortions of the person on the ground seem to show that
it was an exorcism of one possessed. Now, if the vessel was a font for
holding the baptismal water, it would seem more appropriate to represent
upon it the ordinary pre-baptismal exorcism. It seems therefore more
probable that it was intended for the Atrium of a church, where it might
be used to contain holy water."
