## CHAPTER V

### THE GORGONEION

WHETHER looked at as the emblem of a hideous fable or simply as a mask,
the Gorgoneion has in all ages been "reputed one of the most efficacious

of amulets." <span id="fr_273"></span>[259](#fn_273.md) If further proof
were required to sustain this assertion, beyond the frequency of its
use, it would be found in the inscription upon a gem in the collection
of the late Rev. C. W. King, of which he gives a drawing ([Fig.
47](#img_15800).md). On this, beneath the head is: ΑΡΗΓΩ ΡΩΡΩΜΑΝΔΑΡΗ--"I
protect Roromandare."

It may have been the universality of the belief in the Medusa's power
that led to masks becoming such favourites as protectors. Probably the
root idea of the efficacy of any amulet lying in its strangeness,
whether provocative of fear or laughter, may have led to the grotesque
and impossible faces which are so frequently to be seen. Actors in
classic days adopted a mask to hide their features, most likely from the
general dread of the evil eye, lest among the crowd, gazing upon the
performer, some may

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

have possessed that fatal influence which Heliodorus records respecting
the daughter of Calasiris. The masks, whether worn by actors or painted
on walls by way of decoration, were commonly of hideous grotesqueness.
In Rome, certain of these by long usage developed into conventional
faces, just like <span id="img_15900"></span>

that of our modern Punch, two of which typified, respectively, Tragedy
and Comedy. These latter are now only used for decorative purposes, on
theatres and such like buildings, while the Medusa, the prototype of
masks, has continued to be used as a common ornament down to the present
day. The very ugly specimen depicted on [Fig. 67](tee08.htm#img_18300.md),
[p. 183](tee08.htm#page_183) (Chap. VI..md) is one of the early Greek type,
from a terra cotta in the Museum of Syracuse. <span

split-tongue, are of probably the same age. [Fig. 48](#img_15900.md) is
called by Dennis (vol. i,. p. 318) "the Anubis vase." It is Etruscan
black ware from Chiusi in the Museo Casuccini. It is 20 inches high and
has many grinning masks, some of which are unmistakable Medusas. The
rest of our illustrations

speak for themselves, showing how the idea had developed from the
ugliness of the early Greek ideal, to beauty in the Augustan age of
Rome, and how it had again declined both in art and in comeliness during
the period of Byzantine Christianity, as exhibited in the annexed ([Fig.

The inscription upon this undoubted amulet (actual size) from King's
*Gnostics* <span id="fr_275"></span>[261](#fn_275) (p. 67.md) being
translated, reads: "Holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth, hosanna in the highest,
the Blessed." <span id="fr_276"></span>[262](#fn_276.md)

A Medusa's head very similar to the one last mentioned is given in
*Gnostics* (p. 119) as the seal of S. Servatius, Maestricht Cathedral,
which of course brings it

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

down as an amulet to much later times. We know that both on seals and on
coins objects prophylactic against fascination were common even in the
late Middle Ages, and were used down to a period long since the
Reformation. Our own Anglo-Saxon kings adopted such devices on their
coins. <span id="fr_277"></span>[263](#fn_277.md) Not only were the Greek
and Etruscan Gorgons common in Europe, representing a widely-received
myth, but in the East, Bhavani, the Destructive Female Principle, is
still represented with a head exactly agreeing with the most ancient
type of the Medusa: with huge tusks, tongue thrust out, and with snakes
twining about the throat, just as may still be seen in the Etruscan tomb
of the Volumni at Perugia, and such as was described by Hesiod of old.
"In the centre of that tomb <span id="fr_278"></span>[264](#fn_278.md) is
an enormous Gorgon's head, hewn from the dark rock, with eyes upturned
in horror, gleaming from the gloom, teeth bristling whitely in the open
mouth, wings on the temples, and snakes knotted over the brow. You
confess the terror of the image, and almost expect to hear

"Some whisper from that horrid mouth  
  Of strange unearthly tone;  
A wild infernal laugh to thrill  
  One's marrow to the bone.  
But, no! it grins like horrid Death,  
  And silent as a stone."

A lamp of earthenware was suspended over the doorway of this same
chamber, having another Medusa's head on the bottom. A similar lamp was
suspended from the ceiling of the central chamber.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

The illustration here given is from the under side of a very beautifully
wrought bronze lamp in the Museum at Cortona, intended for suspension,
and it would seem from these several instances, that this mode of
depicting the Gorgon's head was, as we are told, <span
id="fr_279"></span>[265](#fn_279.md) a very common Etruscan sepulchral
decoration. <span id="img_16200"></span>

[Fig. 50](#img_16200.md) is from a poor print sold at the Museum, but it
gives a better idea of the Medusa and her surroundings than either of
the plates in Dennis's book. About this lamp he says (vol. ii. p. 402):
"But the wonder of ancient wonders, in the Museum of Cortona, is a
bronze lamp of such surpassing beauty and elaboration of workmanship as
to throw into shade every toreutic work of this class yet discovered in
the soil of Etruria." It is circular, about 23 inches in diameter,
hollow like a bowl, but from the centre rises a sort of conical chimney
or tube, to which must have been attached a chain for its suspension.
Round the rim are sixteen lamps of classic form, fed by oil from the
great bowl, and adorned with foliage in relief. Alternating with them
are heads of the horned and bearded Bacchus. At the bottom of each lamp
is a figure in relief--alternately a draped siren with

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

wings outspread, and a naked satyr playing the double pipes, having a
dolphin beneath his feet. "In a band encircling it are lions, leopards,
wolves, griffons in pairs, devouring a bull, a horse, a boar, and a
stag." The bottom is hollowed in the centre and contains a huge Gorgon's
face. "It is a libel on the face of fair Dian, to say that this hideous
visage symbolises the moon. . . . There is every reason to believe it
was suspended in a tomb, perhaps in a temple as a sacrificial lamp. . .
. It is undoubtedly of ante-Roman times, and I think it may safely be
referred to the fifth century of Rome, or to the close of Etruscan
independence." <span id="fr_280"></span>[266](#fn_280.md)

Gorgon's heads are found also on the cinerary urns, "winged and snaked,
sometimes set in acanthus leaves." Some of these, coloured to the life,
are now to be seen in the Museum at <span id="img_16300"></span>

Perugia.

[Fig. 51](#img_16300.md) is from a vase at Chiusi, which Dennis says (vol.
ii. p. 221) is typical of the early Etruscan style; but whether the
Greeks or the Etruscans first discarded hideousness is uncertain. It is
however clear that the latter people had done so before Roman times, for
in the same tomb of the Volumni, where the frightful face is on the
ceiling, is to be found an "ash chest" with a *patera* at each angle,
having a Gorgon's head, "no longer the hideous

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

mask of the original idea, but the beautiful Medusa of later art, <span
id="fr_281"></span>[267](#fn_281.md) with a pair of serpents knotted on her
head and tied beneath her chin, and wings also springing from her
brows." <span id="fr_282"></span>[268](#fn_282.md)

Not only did the pictorial idea change and develop, but as extremes
meet, so it came in time to be believed, that it was her marvellous
beauty and not her hideousness, that had turned beholders into
stone. <span id="fr_283"></span>[269](#fn_283.md)

art is to be seen in Rome. It is a highly sculptured relief in the Villa
Ludovisi, where also is the Aurora of Guercino, now unfortunately closed
to the public. She is there represented as a woman of severe though
grand beauty, in her dying moments. There are no snakes about her head,
but her hair lies in suggestive snake-like tresses about her neck and
shoulders. Her eyes are closed, but yet she does not appear dead. This
beautiful sculpture is ascribed

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

to the Macedonian period of Greek art. A much later type still is shown
in the triskelion arms of Sicily, in the chapter on Crosses ([p.
290](tee12.htm#page_290).md).

The legend of the Gorgoneion although apparently unknown to the
Egyptians is traceable in the far East, whence indeed the story of
Perseus is said to have been brought. It is known in Cambodia and
Borneo, in Tahiti and in far-off Peru. <span id="img_16500"></span>

The accompanying illustrations amply support this statement. [Fig.
53](#img_16500.md) was taken from the exhibits at the Paris Exhibition of
1889. Those from Peru are from Wiener's *Pérou et Bolivie*, Paris, 1880.
The dog-tooth Medusa seems to have been quite a common object in ancient
Peru, judging from the variety of examples given by Wiener. This looks
like another link in the chain of evidence whence both the South Seas
and South America were originally peopled. There were almost identical
heads from Cambodia. In the Museum at Taunton are several Dyak shields
from Borneo. Every one has for its centre a hideous face with the
conventional tusks, just like those here shown from Peru ([Figs. 54,
55](#img_16600).md). These representations are doubtless the survival of
primæval habit and spring from the central idea embodied in the Medusa.

By some it was held long ago that the Gorgon's head was a symbol of the
lunar disc, hence the allusion by Dennis to "fair Dian." Another theory
has been broached in modern times, that "the Gorgon of antiquity was
nothing but an ape or ourang-outang, seen on the African coast by some
early Greek or Phœnician mariner; and that its ferocious air, its

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

horrible tusks, its features and form caricaturing humanity, seized on
his imagination, which reproduced the monster in the series of
myths." <span id="fr_284"></span>[270](#fn_284.md)

The story of the Medusa is but an incident in the early belief in the
evil eye, and should be carefully

studied by any who are interested in the subject. After using it
effectually in the turning of his enemy Polydectes into stone, Perseus
presented the terrible head to Pallas, the Athenian goddess, who placed
it on her aegis, and in nearly all her statues, and those of her Roman
counterpart Minerva, she bears this notable mask as an amulet. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[271](#fn_285.md)

Originally the aegis was a goat's hide worn as a protective garment, but
later it became a breastplate, and afterwards a shield. When Minerva is
represented with a shield as the war goddess, she has the gorgon's head
emblazoned upon it. Thus was

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

first set the fashion of bearing some prophylactic device by men in
battle, which should first attract the angry glance of their enemies and
then baffle their malignity. A custom once begun, and by so powerful a
deity as the Goddess Athena, would not long want imitators; consequently
representations of fighting men, especially on Greek vases, the
oldest-known European pictures, show some object or other depicted upon
breastplate or shield, but always one that was considered effective as a
protector. <span id="fr_286"></span>[272](#fn_286.md) As the number of
protectors came to be more numerous, so the variety of device upon the
shield became greater: each warrior-chief naturally adopting that in
which he placed the greatest faith. According to Plutarch, Ulysses
adopted the dolphin as his special charm; both on his signet and on his
shield. It is said that he chose this fish to commemorate the saving of
Telemachus from drowning by its means.

Since then the dolphin has become a favourite device, and was in Roman
times one of the special charms against the evil eye. <span
id="fr_287"></span>[273](#fn_287.md) On an ancient vase at Arezzo <span
id="fr_288"></span>[274](#fn_288.md) is a representation of Hercules and
Telamon fighting the Amazons, who are all armed with round shields. The
shield of one of the Amazons bears the Gorgoneion; another who is
wounded bears a Cantharus or two-handled cup on her shield, and on her

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

cuirass a lion. The hero Telamon bears a round shield just like the
Amazons with a large lion passant upon it. Each of the figures
represented may be taken as a leader, and so of course each of that
leader's following would bear the same device. When under the Roman
Empire the usages of war had become regulated by minute laws, the
distinguishing badges of the various legions were prescribed with great
exactness. The devices of several are referred to by Tacitus and also by
Ammianus. They were borne by each man on his shield, and fortunately we
are still able to see what many of those designs were.

A few of these devices here given (Figs. [56](#img_16900)-66.md) are from
*Notitia Dignitatum*, <span id="fr_289"></span>[275](#fn_289.md) by Guido
Pancirolo, Lugduni, 1608. <span id="fr_290"></span>[276](#fn_290.md) Of the
various subjects adopted by authority as the "cognisances" of the Roman
legions, we have made a typical selection. One main idea seems to have
influenced the choice of design. In all the scores of representations
preserved in this remarkable book nearly all had a symbol of the sun in
some form or other as its centre. There are twenty-one different
insignia of the Thracian legions, of which sixteen are here given; all
but one of the twenty-one had a circle in

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

its centre. <span id="fr_291"></span>[277](#fn_291.md) Many had the
crescent as well as the sun; and one, the Thaanni, had six stars
(probably the Pleiades) enclosed within the crescent.

Many of the shields bore various animals as "supporters." These may have
been intended to represent the sun, or as symbols of it. <span

In the descriptions given, it is quite clear that the colours, as well
as the devices, had each their symbolic meaning. <span

centre with two half-circles. Pancirolo calls the whole a skilful design
of symbol (*arguta symboli inventio*), for purple is the imperial
colour.

The description of the insignia of the Ascarii in which the above
occurs, if it had been in modern heraldic language, might well apply to
mediæval coats. <span id="fr_294"></span>[280](#fn_294.md)

providing a "difference" to distinguish them from the Celtæ, who
belonged to the Western Army. <span id="fr_295"></span>[281](#fn_295.md)
Long ages before the Roman period to which these insignia belong,
Grecian heroes carried on their shields what we may fairly term
"armorial bearings." The earliest known pictures, such as the vase
paintings before referred to, show that the device

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

could not have been intended to distinguish any leader from his
following. They give plenty of examples of both helmets and shields.
None of the helmets had visors, which appeared at a much later period,
while the shields had

of objects depicted on shields seem to show that these were adopted at
the special or separate pleasure of the individual chieftains, and the
device may be said to depict his clan totem. They were, like the
cognizances of our mediæval knights in their day, not specially
distinctive of family, but more like the Roman insignia, the badges of
particular corps. Thus, according to Æschylus, in a

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

story dating from the dawn of history, the heroes at the siege of Thebes
bore distinctive devices on their shields, which the poet describes, and
we may at least accept his statements as of historic value.

of anything

The variety of devices upon Chinese shields, and the known unchangeable

their shields from oriental people, and not from Egypt. Among the
Japanese, enormous fans are used as ensigns in war, with various devices
painted upon them; moreover the armorial bearings, the totems of
families, are painted on fans. The fan is

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

considered as a symbol of life--the rivet end is the starting point, and
as the rays expand, so the road of, life widens out. <span

custom of emblazoning strange devices upon

warriors' shields, to catch the eye of the enemy, is an Oriental one,
lends additional weight to the contention that in the Medusa's head we
have the germ of armorial device, because, as before mentioned, Bhavani

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

corresponds to and is most likely the prototype of the Greek Gorgon,
whereas there is no evidence of anything analogous in ancient Egyptian
mythology.

Having then, as we believe, run the original idea to its source, it is
easy to see how it became adopted practically. The belief in the power
of the malignant eye, especially of a furious foe, needed something to
be held up before it, which should absorb the poison of the first
glance. What then so effective as a strangely attractive pictorial
device, to be carried in front of the warrior on his shield, on which
might first alight the dreaded eye? It was thought that a protection
against the dire invisible blow was a much greater safeguard than the
best shield or buckler against the stroke of sword or spear. Hence the
habit of presenting a strange sight to the enemy grew and developed
until it crystallised into a custom which has endured to this day, but
whose origin and meaning have been utterly forgotten.

To continue the chain of evidence, we find the Roman insignia continued
down to Norman times. In the long interval between the placing of the
Medusa's head upon the ægis of Athena, and even the Greek, or still
later Roman age, a great variety of device had been adopted by fighting
men, to be painted on their shields. The stranger and more bizarre the
design, so much the more potent.

In the Bayeux tapestry, the figures upon the shields of the Norman
knights were generally simple and single, carrying on for the most part
the style of the Roman shields. This is the more easily accounted for
when we remember that the Franks and Gauls had, from Constantine's time
onwards, been the chief material of the Roman

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

armies, and that after the destruction of the Empire, they would be
likely to maintain, or at least not to forget, the institutions and
traditions of the school in which they had been trained. We therefore
expect to find that down to a moderately late period, the arms and
discipline of the Franks would perpetuate, in the main, those of their
Roman teachers. In another branch of our subject we see how various
emblems and simple amulets came to be used not only singly, but
compounded and combined, from the most simple to the most various and
complicated types, in all intervening stages; so also we find that the
devices called armorial bearings became compounded and complicated
during the age known as that of Chivalry, until at last a systematic
form of such combination developed itself into a quasi-science, which we
now call Heraldry. Of course in the meantime the old notion of specially
favourite amulets (shall we call them totems?) had become fixed, and
thus certain devices had been adopted by heads of families or tribes
which their dependants adopted as their own special *cognizance*, and
naturally when families became united by marriage, each party
contributed his or her own special family device, and hence arose what
is known as "quartering of arms." This having grown into a
well-recognised system with its official experts and exponents, the
combination of totems, amulets, or special devices, has at length
arrived at the position of a pictorial family history, read with greater
pride, and, in these enlightened days, more highly valued, than any
other records however compiled. It preserves the mark of lineage to the
highest and the noblest born, through means which, though retained

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

and still believed in by humbler people, are treated with scoffing and
contempt by those most interested. Superstition and ignorance are the
mildest words to express the opinions of the adepts in heraldry, for
those who still cherish the root notions on which heraldry is founded.
Who are the totemists, who are the really ignorant, but those who boast
loudest of their refinement, their cultivation, their enlightenment, as
proved by their long pedigree, recorded by amulets?

heads, [Fig. 52](#img_16400.md), from the Naples Museum, are simply
door-knockers from Pompeii, but they admirably represent the transition
period from the earlier grim and ferocious face, to the smiling and
beautiful. It will be noted that the protruded tongue is retained in
two, while in one there is an indication of the old splitting.

protectress of that city, whereby, it may be, infants were committed to
the goddess's care" (Potter, *Archæol. Græc.* ii. p. 320).

<span id="fn_286"></span>[167:272](tee07.htm#fr_286.md) The same objects

The dolphin is the badge of the well-known Somerset family of
Fitz-James, two of whom, Richard, Bishop of London, and his nephew, Sir
John Fitz-James, Lord Chief justice, were the two principal founders of
Bruton School, A.D. 1519. The original foundation deed, a most
interesting document, is given at length by the Rev. F. W. Weaver in
*Som. and Dor. Notes and Queries*, iii. xxii. 241.

these insignia will be found in Logan's History of the Scottish Gael.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[168:276](tee07.htm#fr_290.md) "This valuable
record," Mr. Hodgkin says (*Italy and her Invaders* A. D. 376 to 476.
Oxford, 1880, Vol. i. p. 200) "was compiled in the fifth century. It is
a complete Official Directory and Army List of the whole Roman Empire,
and it is of incalculable value for the decision of all sorts of
questions, antiquarian and historical." The work of Pancirolo consists
of the original text, compiled as above, together with his lengthy and
important Commentarium.

In the Bodleian Library is a very beautiful MS. copy (Canon. Misc. 378)
of the text of the *Notitia*, and containing the whole of the insignia;
moreover, all are highly coloured, so that the curious may learn
precisely what these various badges were like. This is the more
important because, even in those days, as the work fully explains,
colour in itself entered largely as an element into the several designs.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[169:277](tee07.htm#fr_291.md) It may be accepted
as a fact that recognition of the sun was quite characteristic of the
army of the East, while there are many more exceptions to the rule, in
that of the West.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[169:278](tee07.htm#fr_292.md) Surely it is no
straining of Scripture to suggest that the Psalmist must <span
id="page_170">p. 170</span> have been well used to the device as the
central ornament, and familiar with its object, when he says: "For the
Lord God is a sun and shield" (Psalm lxxxiv. 11).

<span id="fn_293"></span>[171:279](tee07.htm#fr_293.md) "Ascarii Juniores,
in luteo clypeo, quem latus limbus rubeus circumscribit, orbem aureum
ferunt: unde octo luteæ cuspides acutæ exeunt. In Madruciatio, globus
nigris lineis in septem partes dividitur, quæ forte septem terræ
habitatæ climata referunt, eaque Imperio Rom. subesse."--*Notitia*, p.
39.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[171:280](tee07.htm#fr_294.md) Many similar
allusions to the colours of the various badges might be given, but in
the Oxford MS. these all tell their own tale. It will be noticed that
there was another legion--Ascarii Juniores--but these belonged to the
Western Army and had a different shield.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[172:281](tee07.htm#fr_295.md) The popular notion
regarding coats of arms is no doubt accurately reflected by the
leader-writer who penned the following: "Armorial bearings, we may
presume, were originally adopted to distinguish a military leader in the
throng of fighting men from a host of others similarly accoutred, and
all with their vizors down. They served, in short, as a sort of
hieroglyphics, invented in an unlettered age, before the capability of
reading a more conventional form of writing had become general"
(*Standard*, June 9, 1894). He will therefore perhaps be surprised to
see how much like mediæval shields were those of the Roman legions.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[175:282](tee07.htm#fr_296.md) The combination of
protective symbols upon the same shield is by no means a feature
peculiar to *mediæval* blazonry or modern heraldry. The ancient
Etruscans were adepts at it, for on a coupe found at Vulci, now in the
Berlin Museum (given in Daremberg et Saglio, p. 187), is a combat
between Poseidon and Ephialtes. On the shield of the former are depicted
a dolphin, scorpion, stag, serpent, lizard and crab, while on that of
the latter there is only a horse rampant (the modern arms of Kent) with
the legend KALON.
