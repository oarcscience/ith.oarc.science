## CHAPTER X

### THE CIMARUTA, SIRENE, TABLETS

AMONG those who have written upon Neapolitan superstitions, one only is
known to the writer who has even alluded to the most curious of all the
many charms worn there against the evil eye. Mr. Neville Rolfe, in
*Naples in 1888*, gives a description of this remarkable amulet, to the
infants of Naples just as common to-day as the "coral and bells" were
until recently among ourselves. Like many other everyday facts, such as
local names for common objects, they are so familiar that nobody notices
them, or perceives that they are at all strange; otherwise we cannot
suppose that residents, like Valletta, Marugi, or Jorio, would have
failed at least to make some reference to what must have been as
familiar to them as their own garments. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[566](#fn_590.md) The number of specimens in the
writer's collection <span id="fr_591"></span>[566a](#fn_591.md) show how
common they are; and moreover that every single one is different from
every other. Of these any number of duplicates might have been obtained,
and further search will no doubt bring to light many fresh examples. A
careful study of these curious objects,

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

which neither Story nor the writers of guidebooks ever seem to have
heard of, shows a likeness in the general plan, maintained even in its
most simple and elementary forms, that amply justifies the name by which
it is universally known. The *cima di ruta*, or, in Neapolitan, the
*cimaruta*, "sprig of rue," tells its own tale.

Although so complicated, and in some cases compounded of so very many
different individual amulets, yet all are traceable to one and the same
root.

We cannot find any notice of this charm throughout the Roman or mediæval
periods, nor indeed is <span id="img_34400"></span>

there any amulet like it, known to the writer, in any of the museums
where one would expect to find such things, <span
id="fr_592"></span>[566b](#fn_592.md) except one. In the Bologna Museum
among the very earliest Etruscan amulets is a small bronze object of
which [Fig. 161](#img_34400.md) is a careful drawing, and about the actual
size. Comparing this, and its clearly ostensible purpose as an amulet
for suspension, with the elaborate modern charm, every candid observer
must admit the remarkable similarity of general form and evident design
in both. It is much to be regretted that no other ancient example of
this kind can be produced; but even so, and while living in hopes of
further finds, it is not unreasonable nor speculative to conclude that
we have here the germ,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

and that the "sprig of rue" is one of the very oldest of existing
amulets. We may safely give it an Etruscan or early Phœnician origin;
for we must always remember that <span id="img_34500"></span>

the objects among which it appears are labelled by experts, as found in
tombs, "della prima età di ferro."

Looking, too, at the almost oriental unchangeableness of the Neapolitan
character, it is no less reasonable to look upon the name itself of the
amulet as a tradition of remote antiquity; and it is easy to see, even
without evidence to prove it, how upon the simple sprig new symbols have
been grafted, so that each of its tips has been made to carry a charm in
itself, until at last we have the multiplied aggregation comprised in
the modern amulet ([Fig. 162](#img_34500).md).

Worn upon the breasts of infants in Naples and the neighbourhood, it is
considered their special protector against the ever-dreaded *jettatura*.

Mr. Neville Rolfe <span id="fr_593"></span>[567](#fn_593.md) gives a list
of eight different symbols, but in addition to these we have to point
out several other features which may be recognised in it.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

To begin with the title-role: No plant had more virtues ascribed to it
in ancient times than rue, and the belief in these has continued down to
the present day.

Pliny <span id="fr_594"></span>[568](#fn_594.md) says the ancients held rue
in peculiar esteem; that the plant has a great liking for the fig-tree
and for that tree only, and that it thrives better under it than
anywhere else. He says it is one of the most active of all medicinal
plants, and one of the principal ingredients used in antidotes. "Every
species of rue, employed by itself, has the effect of an antidote if the
leaves are bruised and taken in wine." It is good for the stings of
serpents--"so much so, in fact, that weasels when about to attack them,
take the precaution first of protecting themselves by eating rue." It is
good too for "stings by scorpions, spiders, bees, hornets and wasps, the
noxious effects produced by cantharides and salamanders, and the bites
of mad dogs." He quotes Pythagoras, Harpocrates, and Diocles, as to the
value of rue in a great number of diseases, and in his last paragraph
says that "of all the plants that are grown, rue is the one most
employed for the maladies of cattle"; altogether he cites it as being a
remedy for eighty-four diseases or ailments. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[569](#fn_595.md)

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

Gerard speaks much of the virtues of rue, but all herbalists call it
"herb of grace." <span id="fr_596"></span>[570](#fn_596.md)

Culpepper says: "It is an herb of the Sun, and under Leo."

It is suggested that inasmuch as rue was hung about the neck as an
amulet in primæval times <span id="fr_597"></span>[571](#fn_597.md) against
fascination, and we know of no other herb that was so used, it may on
that account have acquired its name in the Middle Ages. It was,
moreover, believed to be of all herbs the most potent restorative
medicine, and as a beneficent remedy this was, *par excellence*, the
plant bestowing grace or favour upon such as used it.

No doubt our amulet from Bologna was one of those hung about the neck
over three thousand years ago; and it may fairly be contended that it
represented the same herb whose reputation has lasted through the ages;
which in these latter days has by some means acquired for itself alone
among plants the name "herb of grace." With rue as the

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

basis of our amulet, we have to account for the conventional shape which
the spray assumed even in Etruscan days.

In all the complete specimens here produced (Figs.
[81](tee08.htm#img_20300), [162](#img_34500).md), it will be seen that the
Cimaruta has three main branches; and considering the material of which
these charms are always made, in connection with the other symbols on
this complex object, we can come to no other conclusion than that the
three branches are typical of *Diana Triformis* <span
id="fr_598"></span>[572](#fn_598.md) or of her prototypes. Epithets are
given to her denoting that she is the giver of light and life, benefits
also attributed to Proserpine, and these "make it seem that she
(Proserpine) was also thought to be concerned for women in labour, which
cannot appear strange if we consider her as the same goddess with Diana,
who being in three different capacities, as conversant in heaven, earth,
and hell, has three distinct names: in heaven she is Σελήνη, the *Moon*;
upon the earth Ἄρτεμις, *Diana*, in hell Περσεφόνη, *Proserpine*; whence
are those epithets whereby the poets denote her threefold character as
τρίμορφος, *triformis*, *tergemina*, with several others." <span
id="fr_599"></span>[573](#fn_599.md)

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

Considering her in another threefold character, she is Hecate, Diana,
Proserpine. <span id="fr_600"></span>[574](#fn_600.md)

Montfaucon pictures a statue of this goddess, whom he calls Hecate, in
three positions, so as to bring each form alternately to the front.

<span id="img_34900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.

FIG. 163.  
</span>

1\. On her head is a crescent; above that a flower (the lotus), "the
usual mark of Isis." She holds two torches in her hands, and thus
represents *Diana Lucifera*.

2\. She wears a Phrygian cap with rays of light proceeding from it, and
holds a sword in one hand with a serpent in the other. "Servius says she

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Diana) presides
over health, of which the serpent is the symbol." <span
id="fr_601"></span>[575](#fn_601.md)

3\. She is crowned with laurel, holding a key in her right hand, and
ropes in her left. "The key belongs properly to Hecate; she was guardian
of Hell, where she reigned with Pluto. The ropes referred to her office
of guardian of Hell for reasons evident to all the world."

One of the attributes of Diana was the especial protection of women in
childbirth, and by Cicero she was maintained to be one and the same as
*Ilithyia* or *Lucina*. Horace also invokes her:--

"Sive tu Lucina probas vocari  
          Seu Genitalis." <span id="fr_602"></span>[576](#fn_602.md)

In this attribute we have Diana Lucina as the direct forerunner and
counterpart, in Neapolitan belief, of Madonna del Parto. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[577](#fn_603.md)

This charm must always be of silver, and each one has to bear the
hall-mark; without this the poorest will not have it.

Silver was Diana's own metal--in Greece, in Ephesus, and in Rome alike.
Demetrius who made the *shrines* (*housis*, according to Wiclif) was a
silversmith. <span id="fr_604"></span>[578](#fn_604.md)

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

We turn our silver in our pockets when we first see the new moon or
Diana; and in fact the silver moon is something more than a mere figure
of speech. <span id="fr_605"></span>[579](#fn_605.md)

In all complete specimens two of the attributes are never wanting. These
are the crescent and the hand, with which the tip of every spray is made
to finish, reminding one <span id="img_35100"></span>

of the sun's rays on the sculpture in the tomb of Khuenaten ([Fig.
103](tee11.htm#img_24400).md), except that here the hand, when alone, is
bent into the gesture already described as a potent amulet <span
id="fr_606"></span>[580](#fn_606.md) in itself--the *mano fica*, and in the
other cases is made to grasp some other object. The half-moon on [Fig.
162](#img_34500.md) in itself combines two other symbols, namely horns,
already dealt with, and a serpent enclosing the crescent. <span
id="fr_607"></span>[581](#fn_607.md)

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

The key, which like the crescent takes a prominent position, appears in
every perfect specimen. We may therefore conclude that it is an
important amulet; this key also is compounded. On the Cimaruta the bow
of the key is always shaped like a heart as on [Fig. 162](#img_34500.md).
In [Fig. 112](tee11.htm#img_25900.md) the key appears singly, *i.e.*
without the heart, in many shapes more or less ornamental, clearly
proving the position it holds in Neapolitan estimation as a simple charm
to be worn by adults, as well as in its compounded form by infants. As
an amulet it has a distinct phallic significance. <span
id="fr_608"></span>[582](#fn_608.md)

There can be little doubt that the key is another of the symbols of
Diana, and relates to her in the form of Luna, or in her proper name of
Diana, the wife of Dianus; for *Janus* and *Jana* are but alternative
forms of one and the same word. As keeper of the gates of heaven, Jana
was entrusted with her husband's key to open the portals for the exit of
Aurora and the life and light giving Phœbus, as well as to close the
gates of night. The key might possibly be also regarded as an attribute
of Hecate-Proserpine, who as mistress of the lower world might open the
gates and free the imprisoned spirits. <span
id="fr_609"></span>[583](#fn_609.md) A medal represents her with a key in
one hand and a serpent in the other. <span
id="fr_610"></span>[584](#fn_610.md) It is a remarkable fact, and not to be
overlooked in connection with Diana and the Cimaruta, that the
Neapolitan

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

vernacular for a witch is not, as in ordinary Italian, *strega*, but
*Janara*; evidently conserving the ancient belief In the Bologna
Etruscan Museum are several finger-rings, having little keys attached to
them, precisely like the horns attached to the modern rings in Rome
([Fig. 81](tee08.htm#img_20300).md). They are far too small for use, and
can only have been worn as amulets, thus proving the antiquity of the
key as such.

The heart has already been shown as an ancient symbol in connection with
the cross, and it is suggested that in the key with the heart-handle may
be a conventionalised representation of the *crux ansata*. We may safely
accept the heart as implying an allusion to the maiden goddess "whose
affections were regulated by the key of prudence." <span
id="fr_611"></span>[585](#fn_611.md)

One of the writer's specimens ([Fig. 81](tee08.htm#img_20300).md) contains
two birds, and assuming that they are not meant for the same bird, we

be the cock and the other the eagle.

The cock on several gems, like [Fig. 14](tee06.htm#img_13000.md), is either
alone or combined with Apollo in a *grillo*, as in [Fig.
165.](#img_35300) <span id="fr_612"></span>[585a](#fn_612.md) He is
regarded as a "solar animal," <span id="fr_613"></span>[586](#fn_613.md)
and thus sacred to the sun-gods, Osiris, Serapis, Jupiter, Apollo. The
cock is also the symbol of Mercury, denoting vigilance. He: is sometimes
represented as holding an ear of corn in his bill, meaning that "only
vigilance can produce plenty." <span id="fr_614"></span>[587](#fn_614.md)
As a watchful

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

guardian, who will drive away the fiercest beast, even a lion, the cock
is a singularly appropriate symbol for the protection of an infant, and
hence possibly he is placed on both sides of the Cimaruta, and also upon
the *Mano Pantea* to guard the woman and child. His crow is said to be
the praise offered to the sun-god, when Chanticleer proclaims the
approach of day. It is said that even the lion is afraid of a cock, and
that his eye is all-powerful as an amulet (see [Fig.
13](tee06.htm#img_12800).md); also that all demons with lions' heads vanish
instantly when the cock (or his image) is presented to them. May not
this be the reason why a weathercock is placed high on our church
towers? See remarks on Gurgoyles in Appendix II. Pliny <span
id="fr_615"></span>[588](#fn_615.md) says "the lion is terrified--still
more on seeing the crest, or hearing the crowing of the cock." The eagle
is well known as Jove's own bird. It is shown alongside him on the gem
([Fig. 18](tee06.htm#img_13100).md) as an amulet. In Montfaucon most of the
prints of Jupiter have an eagle accompanying him.

The sword or dagger grasped in the hand appears not only as a separate
charm on [Fig. 112](tee11.htm#img_25900.md), but is in the hand of the
gladiator on the Woburn marble ([Fig. 24](tee06.htm#img_13700).md) and in
several of the hands of Diana Triformis ([Fig. 163](#img_34900).md). This
may represent the knife shown on the *Mano Pantea* ([Fig.
148](tee13.htm#img_29900).md), or it may be the dart of Diana Venatrix as
on [Fig. 112](tee11.htm#img_25900.md).

The fish grasped by the hand is among the separate coral charms shown
also on [Fig. 112](tee11.htm#img_25900.md). The fish appears also on the
Cortona lamp ([Fig. 30](tee06.htm#img_14401).md) and on various gems and
medals (Figs. [14](tee06.htm#img_13000)-18.md). In

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

some it appears as a dolphin. The dolphin was the special attribute of
Neptune, but Diana-Proserpine was a sea goddess, and it may as an amulet
refer to her, inasmuch as it is on her statue ([Fig. 175](#img_36200).md).

Lastly, the flower must be intended for the lotus, the symbol of Isis,
*i.e.* of Diana. <span id="fr_616"></span>[589](#fn_616.md)

To sum up: we have in this highly composite and therefore powerful
amulet, no less than thirteen separate and distinct symbols, any one of
which by itself may be taken as prophylactic against the dreaded evil
eye. These are: 1, Rue.; 2, Diana Triformis; 3, Silver; 4, Hand; 5,
horned Crescent; 6, Serpent; 7, Key; 8, Heart; 9, Cock; 10, Eagle; 11,
Sword or Dart; 12, Fish; 13, Lotus. <span
id="fr_617"></span>[589a](#fn_617.md)

Of all the many charms combined in the Cimaruta we find on close study
that there is scarcely one which may not directly or indirectly be
considered as connected with Diana, the goddess of infants, worshipped
to-day by Neapolitans as zealously as ever she was in old times by the
men of Ephesus and Rome; the only change is in her name. Many a
Demetrius, who still makes her silver shrines, flourishes near the
Piazza Margherita, though nowadays he knows her only as La Madonna; she
is, however, his goddess, his "regina del Cielo, della terra, del parto,
ed anche del Inferno."

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

Figs. [166](#img_35600)-[169](#img_35800.md) are all modern amulets in
daily use, and all alike avowedly *contra la jettatura*. These are all
for suspension, and are mostly provided

with chains by which to hang. Like all Diana charms, they are of silver.
Unlike the Cimaruta, these are always made both sides alike, for the
reason that they are worn by women outside the dress, or hung up in the
house, specially

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

in the window. Although all pass under the general term *Corno*, which
is Neapolitan for amulet, these particular objects are known as
*Sirene*, or *Cavalli Marini* respectively. In all the former the female
figure is crowned. In one she is seated on a double sea-horse, though
usually the horses are represented by their two tails rather than two
heads. There are, though very scarce,

</span>

specimens of the figure on a single sea-horse. Readers who are familiar
with Abraxas gems will notice the Gnostic influence so plainly visible
in these double-tailed mermaids.

By far the most difficult problem connected with this subject has been
to account for these strange objects as amulets at all; and next, for
their being known in Neapolitan as *sirene*.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

visible object from Naples. Parthenope, one of the Sirens, is a name of
the city itself. "Hyginus writes that at the time of Proserpine's rape,
the Sirens came into Apollo's country, which is Sicily, and that Ceres,
to punish them for not assisting her daughter Proserpine, turned them
into birds." <span id="fr_618"></span>[590](#fn_618.md) We have plenty of
representations of the *Sirens*, birds with women's faces, as they were
believed to be by the ancients; and moreover we have some evidence of
their being used in this form as amulets. In the famous Cortona lamp
they are shown alternating round the Medusa's head in company with the
*capo di bove*, fish and Priapus, all well-recognised amulets (see [Fig.
50](tee07.htm#img_16200).md).

The arms of the Neapolitan family of Petronia are a siren, Parthenope,
playing a flute. <span id="fr_619"></span>[591](#fn_619.md) On a

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

medal belonging to them she is represented as a female standing, having
wings of the angel kind, but with a bird's tail and legs. There is thus
everything about the locality of Naples to connect it with the Sirens,
and we know their conventional shape, but whence did the notion come,
and how are we to connect them with Proserpine? <span
id="fr_620"></span>[592](#fn_620.md)

The Etruscan lamp once more directs us to Egypt. There we find that Isis
was represented

<span id="img_35900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 170.--From

with wings ([Fig. 170](#img_35900).md) as a flying goddess. This is a step
forward; but Wilkinson, vol. iii. p. 115, shows us precisely what we are
looking for ([Fig. 171](#img_35900).md). This is the goddess *Hathor*,
holding precisely the same relation to Isis as the Ephesian Artemis held
to the chaste Roman Diana; or rather we may say that Hathor was to Isis
what Proserpine was to Diana. <span id="fr_621"></span>[593](#fn_621.md)

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

On Egyptian paintings and sculptures we have Hathor represented as a
bird-woman; that is Isis, that is Proserpine, that is Diana. How do we
know that the crowned figure sitting on sea-horses, called a Siren, is
Proserpine, and therefore Hecate, and therefore Diana the protectress of
women in childbirth, and therefore a suitable amulet for the use of

women as a guardian against the evil eye? No candid reader will refuse
to admit that in the bird-woman Parthenope, on the Cortona lamp, we have
the same person as the bird-woman Hathor in [Fig. 171](#img_35900.md).
Further, if any doubt remained, we have a representation of Isis herself
([Fig. 172](#img_36000).md) holding her own siren attribute, just as we
shall see the same

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

goddess represented by the statues of the Ephesian Diana bearing the
distinguishing symbols belonging to her under that title.

[Fig. 173](#img_36000.md) is from a photograph purchased in Naples. It is
part of the very large Greek vase of Pluto and Proserpine, No. 2959 in
the Museum. The figure on the sea-horse is undoubtedly Proserpine. It is
a colossal vase of the- transition period, about the third century B.C.,
with twenty-two figures, nearly all named. This one has been of great
service in identifying figures found upon other vases.

The three-headed Cerberus sufficiently marks the locality. We invite
attention next to [Fig. 174](#img_36100.md), half-size of a drawing by the
writer from another late Greek vase of about the same date, found at
Capua about 1888, now belonging to Mr. Neville Rolfe. The latter has no
other ornament than this solid block upon a gray ground. The vase is of
course a small one, but there is no doubt as to its genuineness. It will
hardly be disputed that these two Greek paintings represent the same
idea and the same person. From these the reader is asked to turn to the
five statues of Diana (Figs. [69](tee08.htm#img_18800.md),
[175](#img_36200)-[178](#img_36300).md) taken from Bellori. Upon these seem
to

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

be crowded the various symbols of Diana, every one of which in some
place or other is to be found as a separate amulet. Upon four of these
statues, perhaps four or five centuries later in date than the

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greek vases, is to
be seen, nearly in the same position, the female on the sea-horse.

Will any person venture to deny that the several representations here
brought together are anything else than the prototypes, the direct
parents of the modern Neapolitan amulet shown on [Fig. 168](#img_35700.md),
and

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

of all those shown on Figs. [166](#img_35600), [167](#img_35700.md)?
Inasmuch, too, as we know the ancient ones to represent
Proserpine-Diana, so it is maintained that the modern amulet called a
siren also represents the same deity.

<span id="img_36300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 177.,

There are in Montfaucon, and n other books of classic art, plenty of
female figures sitting on seahorses, but these are called Nereids. No
one will venture to call those here produced by that name, and possibly
some of the so-called Nereids may in reality be Proserpines.

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

Such a chain of evidence, connecting in the most obvious manner the
beliefs of to-day with the mythology of perhaps thirty centuries ago, is
not often to be found; and again, judging from the known to the unknown,
it is reasonable to maintain that most of the habits and customs now
persistently upheld by the people would, if they could be thus traced,
be found to have their beginnings in the same dim ages of obscure
antiquity. Conversely, there is hardly a custom or occult practice of
the ancients which may not be traced somewhere or somehow amongst their
modern descendants. The statuette ([Fig. 175](#img_36200).md), well known
to the writer, is now in the Museum of the Collegio Romano. The others
are in private collections. It is strange that not one of these four
seems to have been known to Montfaucon, or to his authorities. He has,
however, the more typical statue of the Ephesian goddess ([Fig.
69](tee08.htm#img_18800).md), in which she appears as the patroness of
maternity. Those which have the attribute of Proserpine so prominent,
appeal more to the Roman ideal, although they are matronly in
appearance.

It is difficult satisfactorily to interpret the various attributes upon
the four statues from Bellori. In general type they are strikingly
alike, though each one is different in detail. Every one has the *corona
turrita*, by which the author of *Symbolica* says *vertex inisgnitur*.
This is usually the attribute of the Phrygian Cybele as well as of
Diana. The two Farnesian statues have wreaths or floral crowns; in the
centre of each is no doubt her own flower--but which? The rose,
chrysanthemum, heliochrysum, lotus, were all sacred to Diana. One has
the sun upon her crown, while every one wears a half-moon

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

on her breast with the horns downward, just as these amulets are now
always worn by horses.

The object above the crescent on three statues is said to represent a
crab, but the whole looks more like a scorpion, with the crescent to
represent his claws. We are distinctly told <span
id="fr_622"></span>[594](#fn_622.md) that the crab was suspended to the
neck of Diana of Ephesus because it was sacred to her. Hence we find the
crab on the breast in [Fig. 69](tee08.htm#img_18800.md), and also engraved
on gem amulets (see [Fig. 17](tee06.htm#img_13001).md).

All four statues have two busts upon them, which the present writer does
not pretend to explain; a single bust, something like one of these,
appears as an amulet on the Kertch necklace ([Fig.
21](tee06.htm#img_13500).md).

Another feature common to three of the statuettes is that they have in
each case, both above and below the sea-horses, a group of three nude
Graces; and the upper group in each shows the outer figure holding a
cornucopia. The lower groups have wings, and in one they are holding the
wreaths in their hands, probably the same wreath that two of the other
statues have on their heads. Moreover, it will be noted that on the
breast of [Fig. 69](tee08.htm#img_18800.md) are two draped females holding
up a wreath, and also on this latter are shown two of the nude females
in line with the three stags' heads.

The fourth statue ([Fig. 178](#img_36300).md) has but one row of Graces,
without anything in their hands. It is difficult to determine the
meaning of these nude figures. They may possibly represent Diana
Triformis. <span id="fr_623"></span>[595](#fn_623.md)

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

Every one of these five statues has both hands posed in distinct
gesture-like attitudes, and every hand is open.

The *cavalli marini* (Figs. [166](#img_35600)-[169](#img_35800).md) of
course represent the same sea-horses as those upon the Diana statues.
The sea-horse is an amulet apart, worn equally by the cab horses and
upon the breasts of Neapolitan women. On the statues these creatures
seem to have heads more like goats than horses. The same may be said of
the silver charms. Nevertheless they are all known as *cavalli*.

Each of the statues wears a veil, reaching to the ground upon four, but
curtailed to a mere head-dress on the fifth ([Fig.
69](tee08.htm#img_18800).md). These are like the veils often worn by
brides, not to hide but to set off the face. Upon Diana the veil
represents night--"Velo Dianæ nox indicatur." Moreover, it is the symbol
of modesty and chastity. <span id="fr_624"></span>[596](#fn_624.md)

In the British Museum is an ancient terra-cotta flat bottle, having on
both sides the same figure, brandishing in the right hand a sword and in
the left a scabbard. All that is known of it is that it was purchased at
the Durand sale, described in the "Cabinet Durand," by De Witte, Paris
1836, No. 1550. It is called a Scylla, but on what grounds we are not
told. [Fig. 179](#img_36700.md) is from a rough sketch by the writer, but
it is sufficient to suggest the general resemblance of this figure to
the Proserpines upon the Diana statues and upon the Neapolitan amulets.
The two dogs are true Diana symbols, but there is no sign of a crown.
One striking feature is in common: the dolphins on the water-bottle are
matched by the dolphin alongside the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Proserpine on
[Fig. 175](tee13.htm#img_31800.md). In any case the coincidence is strange,
and does not appear to have been noticed before. <span
id="fr_625"></span>[597](#fn_625.md)

The same conception of the double sea-horse, combined with fish tails,
is apparent in the Durand

<span id="img_36700"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.
179.](tn/36700.jpg)

</span>

bottle, though the twist is not in the same direction as that invariably
seen in the Abraxas and in the Sirens (Figs. [166](#img_35600.md),
[167](#img_36700).md).

Considering how much these charms vary, and the singular individuality
there is in all of them, notwithstanding the very rough work of
Neapolitan silversmiths, it is yet remarkable that they should all be so
true to their respective types. It cannot therefore be surprising that
after all these centuries the modern charm should not have developed

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

a far greater divergence, and that it still keeps so near to its
prototypes on the Greek vases of two thousand years ago. Such
divergences as there are, doubtless arise from their having had to pass
through the mill of the Gnostic influence, whereby they adopted new
forms without, however, departing from their own types. The bells upon
these various objects are all much alike, and of one conventional kind.
So indeed are the bells upon our children's corals, and strangely ours
are always of the same special pattern and size as these Neapolitan
ones; but stranger still, on the walls of Medinet Habou are these same
little bells upon the personified *crux ansata*, [Fig.
127](tee12.htm#img_28400.md). Are these mere coincidences? Is it also a
coincidence that the coral we use was also an ancient protective amulet
for children, and that we have it always mounted with silver? Is it also
mere coincidence that two of the sirens shown on [Fig. 166](#img_35600.md)
end in whistles like our baby's toy? <span
id="fr_626"></span>[598](#fn_626.md)

We cannot explain the exact likeness in the little bells between those
on our baby's amulet and on that of the ancient Egyptians or modern
Neapolitans; still the peculiar shape remains the same from the time of
Ptolemy X. and during all the eighteen centuries since Pliny wrote. The
little bells of brass seen upon horses are different: in shape they are
mostly globular. "Le son de l'airain" was

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

thought to have a prophylactic virtue. Little bells of this metal were
employed in certain rites, but also worn as amulets. They are often
suspended to the phallus. <span id="fr_627"></span>[599](#fn_627.md)

We omitted to refer to one of the amulets upon the Naples cab horses on
[Fig. 83](tee08.htm#img_20800.md), the man in a boat. This is said to be
Osiris, the Nile, or water, by which the sun fertilises and nourishes
the earth. The old confusion between the several deities here appears
again; for Horus is also depicted as sitting on a lotus (his usual
representation), and also in a boat. He also is a sun-god, <span

and as much confounded with his father Osiris as is Demeter with her
daughter Persephone. [Fig. 180](#img_36900.md) represents Horus <span
id="fr_628"></span>[600](#fn_628.md) on a lotus, holding the whip of
sovereignty in his left hand, with his right as usual raised towards his
lips in token of silence. Above are the regular Gnostic symbols, (the
Turkish) sun and moon. His boat is the sacred *baris*, terminating at
the prow in the head of an eagle or vulture, and at the stern in that of
a bull-both symbols of the sun.

All these latter accessories do not appear on the Neapolitan horse
charm, but the idea is the same. Of course the *capo di bove* is the old
favourite, repeated all round the tomb of Cecilia Metella, the Cortona
lamp, and in two rows of three each on the statue of Diana ([Fig.
69](tee08.htm#img_18800).md), where they are flanked by dragons and
griffins, which were sacred to

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

her. <span id="fr_629"></span>[601](#fn_629.md) Even these latter are
compounded creatures, and so represent double attributes, all pointing
to the sun: the dragon or flying serpent with a lion's head, and the
griffin or lion with vulture's head and claws. The serpent is here
supposed to represent the inner senses and the quickened
understanding. <span id="fr_630"></span>[602](#fn_630.md) The bee is
specially sacred to Diana and Ceres. It is the symbol of virginity, as
testified by many ancient authorities. <span
id="fr_631"></span>[603](#fn_631.md) Our custom of beating kettles, ringing
bells, and making other noises to cause swarming bees to settle, is not
a modern one. Varro (*De re rust.* iii.) says: "Who does not know that
dispersed and wandering bees may be got to one place by cymbals and
rattles (*plausibus*)?" <span id="fr_632"></span>[604](#fn_632.md)

Among symbolic amulets are some very remarkable objects which have
hitherto met with rather limited attention.

One of these Jahn (p. 52) calls a wonderful monument and, moreover, a
distinct amulet. It is a terra-cotta plaque, circular in shape, with a
sort of handle projection on one side. It is like a very shallow bowl
with a flat rim round the edge, within which are huddled together a
number of very remarkable objects. This one is now to be seen in the
British Museum ([Fig. 181](#img_37100).md). The drawing reduced from Jahn's
book is by no means satisfactory, yet it is for our purpose much clearer
than a photograph. The plaque came to the

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Museum by the
bequest of Sir W. Temple, who described it as found at Pozzuoli. Jahn
says his illustration is one-third of the original size, but the plate
itself does not exceed six inches in diameter. The purpose of this terra
cotta, besides serving for a very compound amulet, is not referred to by
Jahn, although tablets of this character cannot have been

<span id="img_37100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.

uncommon in classic times; for we read of another found in Amyklai,
described by Aberdeen in *Walpole's Memoirs*, p. 452. Moreover, there is
in the Ashmolean Museum a complete specimen with a portion of another,
brought by Mr. A. Evans from Taranto.

All these seem to have a projection by way of handle. [Fig.
182](#img_37200.md) represents the Oxford disc.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> [Fig.
183](#img_37300.md) is in the Naples Museum, and there is another in
Berlin. Comparison of these illustrations will convince the I reader
that, whatever their purpose may have been, they generally convey the
same idea, and are as much alike as any of the examples of the ancient
*Mano Pantea* or of the modern *Cimaruta*. The material is the same, and

<span id="img_37200"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG. 182.--From

</span>

the size, about 5 inches in diameter, is nearly alike in all: the
various objects represented upon them all are not raised but rather
deeply sunk.

A glance is sufficient to show that many of the objects represented are
the same in each, though their position upon the respective plaques
varies. In the London and Naples tablets they seem to be arranged in
lines vertically, and more or less horizontally; in the

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Oxford one they
seem to be divided into four segments, with a number of the articles
ranged round the circumference, the rest being roughly radiated from the
centre. Moreover, the latter tablet has a hole, apparently for
suspension, which the British Museum one has not.

</span>

On the top of Figs. [181](#img_37100) and [183](#img_37300.md) we see our
old friends the sun and the moon very distinctly. In the other, both are
also represented, but in different positions. The three upright objects
between the sun and moon in Fig. [181](#img_37100.md) appear likewise in
all the tablets. Jahn says he does not know what they are.

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mr. Evans says
they are distaffs, and that a fourth, a larger one, is also there. <span
id="fr_633"></span>[604a](#fn_633.md) We presume he means the horizontal
object alongside--these distaffs, he says, are wound round with wool.
There is a large upright object beneath the ladder in the British Museum
tablet which Jahn does not refer to, but which Minervini says is an
acorn. In the middle of the next row, above the ladder, is a head over
an object like an *ambos*. Neither of these can be identified on the
Oxford tablet, although Mr. Evans seems to see in it the "head of a
nymph." In each tablet is seen a pair of Amphoræ, or Canthari; and again
we are reminded of the Cantharus upon both our examples of the Mano
Pantea. These represent, we are told, the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux).
On either side of these is a sheep, but there is nothing to match them
in the Oxford or Naples tablets. This animal, however, closely resembles
that upon the modern bone amulet from Sienna (see [Fig.
112](tee11.htm#img_25900).md). In front of one sheep at the top of the
ladder is, according to Jahn, an oval thing which may be a mussel. On
the Oxford tablet is something like it on the right of the distaffs. In
the next row is a round object in the centre, which Jahn cannot explain.
Then come the club and the trident-the latter very plain on all the
plates. The ladder is plain on all, and Jahn says between the torch and
ladder is a two-pronged fork (*Zweizack*), and that this is an attribute
of Hades. The lyre and bow appear on all, and next the lyre (on the
left) what he thinks is meant for a pair of cymbals. The open hand is
plain on all; the right hand in two, and left

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

in the other. To the right of the lyre is a leaf, the meaning of which,
Jahn says, is not clear, but it is surely the phallic fig-leaf. The
pincers are distinct on all, as they are upon the nail, Fig.
[159](tee13.htm#img_32800.md). One other object, common to all the tablets,
which neither Jahn nor Mr. Evans attempts to explain, is the oblong slab
with twelve square holes in regular lines. Three flat discs, on all the
plates, Mr. Evans thinks may be coins, but three similar discs are upon
the table on the hand, Fig; [156](tee13.htm#img_31800.md), apparently as an
offering to Serapis. There are, besides these, several objects upon the
Oxford tablet not to be found upon those of the British Museum or
Naples. First, the upright column above the crescent, which Mr. Evans
calls the club of Herakles, we submit is much too important an object
upon this combination of attributes to be the symbol of either of the
lesser gods. It is suggested that this may be one of the pillars of
Hermes on which that god engraved all knowledge. <span
id="fr_634"></span>[605](#fn_634.md)The objection to this is that the
caduceus has already typified him. Still there may be two symbols like
the sun and thunderbolt for the same god. Again, there is a bird, but
hardly a dove; <span id="fr_635"></span>[605a](#fn_635.md) it would rather
be intended for a cock or an eagle. The object near the bird, called a
lover's knot by Mr. Evans, is, we suggest, much more probably a
scorpion. The "curved object" is manifestly the same as Jahn calls a
*Füllhorn*, but it rather represents a scythe or sickle; which of them
is the tunny or the grapes which Mr. Evans sees we cannot explain.

Jahn finishes his description of Fig. [181](#img_37100.md) with the

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

remark that "surely are distinguishable over and above the stars, the
symbols of Zeus, Poseidon, Hermes, Herakles, Apollo, Artemis,
Hephaistos, perhaps of Pluto and of Demeter: the cymbals may typify
Dionysos or other orgiastic deities; the cornucopia Tyche (Fortuna)."
The well-known symbols of various deities here brought together make it
pretty evident that the rest, which we cannot identify, all belong to
the same category, and are grouped here for a like purpose. Upon the
general aspect of these tablets Mr. Evans points out that their
wheel-like character renders it highly probable that they were used for
stamping cakes in use on various religious occasions. The segmental
division certainly recalls the cakes still to be seen in the Pompeian
room at Naples, and the same thing appears on the cakes set before the
"three men" by Abraham (Fig. [116](tee11.htm#img_26800).md), from the early
Ravenna mosaics. Loaves or cakes so marked are still sold in the streets
and markets of Naples, while our own hot-cross buns perpetuate the same
form, though now under a Christian guise.

It is much to be desired that the British Museum authorities would have
a cast made from the plaque in their possession (Fig.
[181](#img_37100).md), for it, like all the other similar tablets, is an
unmistakable mould. Examination of the convex casts placed alongside the
mould (Fig. [182](#img_37200).md) in the Ashmolean, and of a fragment of
another in the same case with it, shows much more distinctly what the
objects are intended to represent, than can be determined when one only
looks at the concave mould. Another matter of interest is, that the
fragment at Oxford is an exact duplicate of the plaque in the British
Museum

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Fig.
[181](#img_37100).md), and is broken in a line from about the centre of the
ladder, passing through the lyre to the centre of the three discs, and
preserves the objects above that line. The cast makes clear several
objects which Jahn evidently did not understand in the perfect plaque of
Sir W. Temple. It is remarkable that duplicate moulds, identical in
pattern and in shape, should have been found at Pozzuoli and Taranto.
The Naples example is both clearer and sharper, as well as in much
better preservation than the others. The engraving published in the
*Bullettino Archeologico Napoletano*, No. 120, 1857, from which we take
Fig. [183](#img_37300), has been badly copied in Daremberg (p. 256.md), but
without acknowledgment.

We also give here a copy (Fig. [184](#img_37800).md) of a terra-cotta lamp
from the collection of Signor Barone, also published in the *Bullettino
Archeologico Napoletano*, vol. iii. p. 182, Tav. VII. Another plaque of
the same kind is at Berlin, too indistinct and wanting in definiteness
to be worth reproduction, yet a large number of the objects can be
readily made out, and are common to all the others here shown. In the
arrangement of objects it matches Fig. [182](#img_37200.md), particularly
in the division into four segments; but in this Berlin plaque is one
very noticeable and remarkable point--it has a border almost identical
in pattern, if not actually the same, as that shown on the lamp, Fig.
[184](#img_37800.md). Attention is particularly invited to this, inasmuch
as we hope by these drawings to prove what was the object of these terra
cottas. A mere glance at the three cuts, really representing five
distinct moulds, is sufficient to prove that the purpose is the same in
all, and that the majority of the objects represented upon them are
identical, and therefore must

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

all symbolise the same ideas or persons. Besides these, there is,
another plate of the like kind in the Louvre, which however the writer
has not seen. The greater plainness of the objects upon Fig.
[184](#img_37800.md),

<span id="img_37800"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.

Click to enlarge](img/37800.jpg.md)  
FIG. 184.  
</span>

together with their proper convex forms in the casts at Oxford, and a
general comparison of all together, enable us to correct Jahn, and to
determine what certain obscure objects are in each of the moulds.
Minervini (Editor of the *Bullettino*) writing on Fig.
[183](#img_37300.md), remarks upon the great similarity between this and
Jahn's plaque (Fig. [181](#img_37100).md). He insists that

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

the whole is an amulet symbolising many divinities; that a horizontal
line through the centre of each of these plates passes through a series
of identical objects.

Minervini says that the open hand has not been sufficiently considered
by Jahn; that it seems to point upward to the numerous symbols depicted
above it; that he considers these hands to be of the same meaning as
those Jahn calls votive hands, here dealt with in the chapter on the
Mano Pantea.

Beginning on the left, he compares the two *seriatim*. The ladder, he
remarks, is doubtful in its meaning to Jahn, but we see in both plaques
the symbols of the twelve great gods. Ceres however is wanting, whereas
on Barone's lamp she is represented by the ear of corn; and he maintains
that what seems to be a ladder is *arnese di tessere*, i.e. a loom, and
that it represents Ceres in all cases. In every one of the moulds seen
by the writer there is the ladder unmistakable.

The next symbol, he says, is a lighted torch with the flame turned to
the left. This, Jahn says, is a two-pronged fork; but he is surely
wrong, for that would mean nothing.

On Fig. [181](#img_37100.md) is a nondescript object above the ladder,
corresponding in position to what Minervini calls a flame. Now, as in
the Ashmolean plaque there is an undoubted torch, we think that in both
moulds a torch with flame turned to the left comes next the ladder, and
that it represents Vesta; so asserts Minervini. On the lamp we see the
torch most distinctly. Next comes a scabbard, which Jahn took for the
torch. It is very plain, and shows the ring by which it is attached to
the belt (*balteo*) on Fig. [183](#img_37300.md). This

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

is for Mars. The scabbard is shown on the lamp, and is probably intended
by one of the objects upon the Mano Pantea which we could not explain.
Minervini in one of his articles calls this a quiver (*turcasso*), but
corrects himself afterwards. The thunderbolt appears in all the plaques,
and needs no explanation. On the lamp it is superseded by the eagle.

Next, according to Minervini, is the patera in the centre, representing
Juno. In the cast of the fragment at Oxford this centre is marked
distinctly with a cross, which seems to point to its being an offering
cake.

Next comes the caduceus of Mercury, plain on all the plaques, and also
on the Barone lamp. The trident of Neptune is on all the moulds, but on
the lamp he is represented by a dolphin.

Next is the club of Hercules, followed by an object which is not easily
explained. On Figs. [181](#img_37100), [183](#img_37300.md), between the
caduceus and trident, there is in each what Minervini says
unhesitatingly is a knife in the latter; and if this be so, it is
doubtless a knife in the other. In the B.M. tablet (Fig.
[181](#img_37100).md) is a large double object next the trident. We believe
this to represent the two separated objects in Fig. [183](#img_37300.md),
which are the club and possibly, as suggested by Minervini, a distaff
simply, or a distaff filled with wool (*conocchia o pennecchio*).
Against this, however, his own argument respecting another of the
objects tells with some force. Speaking of the cymbals, he refutes
Jahn's opinion, and says it is impossible to suppose two symbols of the
same deity upon one monument. Now, as Mr. Evans says that the three
upright objects found on all three

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

of our plaques represent three distaffs, and also that another object on
his (Fig. [182](#img_37200).md), near the ladder, is a large distaff, it is
very difficult to reconcile authorities. <span
id="fr_636"></span>[605b](#fn_636.md) The three objects referred to have
every appearance in Mr. Evans's cast of being rather three spools or
bobbins, for the winding of the thread is distinct upon them, and
therefore I should say they represent the three Fates. But I can offer
no opinion as to the larger object, also said to be a distaff.

In all three moulds, and also on the lamp, are found the tongs or
pincers of Pluto or rather Vulcan. Minervini says that he believes these
to represent the shears of the Fates rather than the tongs of Pluto; but
here again he is inconsistent with his own dictum. He says he cannot
attempt to explain the obscure article near (*i.e.* below) the *telajo*
(loom) of Ceres. Whatever this may be, there is the same nondescript at
the foot of the ladder in all three plaques. Jahn calls this a shell,
but in his mould (Fig. [181](#img_37100).md) it appears more like an acorn.
I would suggest rather that in each case this object is meant for a
pine-cone; the same symbol is found upon the lamp and on the hand, Figs.
[156, 157](tee13.htm#img_31800.md). Minervini believes the object called a
fig-leaf by Jahn, close to the lyre (Fig. [181](#img_37100).md), to be the
same as that on Fig. [183](#img_37300.md), between the tongs and the moon.
This he thinks to be a bunch of grapes for Dionysos--a bunch of grapes
certainly

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

appears on the lamp. He wildly asserts that the three objects between
the vases, which are certainly more like reels of yarn, are three masses
of incense, and that they recall the well-known verse of Ovid:--

"Et digitis Tria Tura tribus sub limine ponit."

He says this is proved by the adoption in some rites of three lumps
(*grani*) of incense. This, to the present writer, seems far fetched.

The three discs near the trident are very evident in Figs.
[181](#img_37100)-[183](#img_37300.md); and in Mr Evans's cast from Fig.
[182](#img_37200.md), the object at the top of the caduceus is very
unmistakably intended also for them though obscure on the mould. They
represent the three sacrificial loaves doubtless the same as are on the
hand, Fig. [156](tee13.htm#img_31800.md). It is a coincidence to be noted
that upon the table spread by Abraham (Fig. [116](tee11.htm#img_26800).md)
we see the same number of round cakes, each, too, marked with a cross.
Near the lyre on Fig. [183](#img_37300.md) is a bird, which Minervini says
is certainly the Iynx, or dove of Venus. A bird also appears plainly on
the Oxford cast, and also on the lamp.

The undoubted owl upon the Naples plaque of course means Minerva. Upon
this Minervini says that the same position in Jahn's drawing is occupied
by a head over an anvil, but that this is a modern restoration! It is
certainly very indistinct, and the head may be a creation of Jahn's
draughtsman; but on the other hand there is a head upon the lamp, and
also we find a head upon the Isiac tablet from Pignorius (Fig.
[185](#img_38300).md). It has been suggested that one of the obscure
objects on the Ashmolean mould may represent a head. Minervini believes
that the head in Fig. [181](#img_37100.md) is really an owl, and the anvil
its tail.

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

Near the hand beneath the bird, is the strigil accompanied by the vase
of oil, "or rather the *xistrolecilo*, a well-known symbol of bath and
palestra." These are called *strigil and guttus* in Smith's *Dictionary
of Antiquities*. The square tablet in all the plaques is, according to
Minervini, a tabella representing athletic laws of the gymnasium and
palestra. I prefer to follow the example of Jahn and Evans, by saying I
do not know what it is. On comparing them together no candid reader

<span id="img_38300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![FIG.
185.](tn/38300.jpg)

FIG. 185.  
</span>

will deny that all these moulds were certainly intended for the same
purpose, particularly as duplicates were found so far apart as Pozzuoli
and Taranto.

Although very different in the general arrangement of the objects
represented upon it, yet the lamp shows so much resemblance, and it has
so many symbols belonging to the other combinations, that it is but
reasonable to consider them upon the lamp as representing the same ideas
or cult as upon the plaques. In the centre is a winged

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

female seated, whom we may take to be a divinity, surrounded by so many
symbols that she seems to be intended for Fortuna Pantea, who is called
upon a Roman monument FORTVN : OMNIVM · GENT · ET · DEOR. In her left
hand she holds a cornucopia, from which appear flowers and grapes. In
her right she holds a patera, which she is presenting to a serpent
twined round an altar of offerings. At the top is a beardless head,
enclosed in an ornament like a crescent. Beneath the crescent is a
wheel-like object mounted on something unknown, but the whole strikingly
suggestive of the Ashantee crescents (Fig. [88](tee08.htm#img_21500).md);
and we may fairly explain the whole as the sun and moon. We see also the
eagle; the Dolphin; <span id="fr_637"></span>[606](#fn_637.md) the
scabbard, or, as Minervini calls it, the quiver; the club; the sistrum
of Isis; the lyre; the tongs (these are no shears); the caduceus; the
thyrsus of Bacchus, having the pine-cone at the top; the cymbals of
Cybele, Bacchus, and Juno, suspended to the "pomegranates of
Proserpine," and near them the ear of corn of Ceres. There is a second
serpent, Agathodemon, often seen in connection with Fortuna, <span
id="fr_638"></span>[607](#fn_638.md) which is climbing up behind and
looking over her shoulder, much in the same position as that on the hand
(Fig. [157](tee13.htm#img_31800).md), whereon again two serpents are
represented.

Presuming that the illustrations, here brought together for the first
time, have been duly examined and compared, we must now try to ascertain
the true object of the moulds represented by three of them.

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

Heydemann, writing in the *Gazette Archéologique*, 1883, p. 7, quotes
Lenormant as of opinion that they are intended for the making of mirrors
in bronze. M. Albert Dumont and M. Robert de Lasteyrie support this
opinion, while M. Henzey says they have served to mark the religious
impression upon sacrificial cakes. Mr. Arthur Evans assumes this to be
an unquestioned fact, as he simply calls them "moulds for sacred cakes."
He says later (p. 49) that it seems "highly probable" that this was
their purpose. Heydemann disagrees with both these opinions, and
supports Jahn in the contention that they belong to the class
ἀποτρόπαια, that is of prophylactic amulets; and he goes on to compare
the various specimens of moulds known to him, but not including those
now at Oxford, and gives to some of the objects an explanation differing
from any yet noted: for instance, he finds a thimble, a rosette, a key,
a wing, a lizard, etc., but admits that the objects are often very
indistinct. After disputing several contentions of Minervini, he points
out that in every case there is an umbilicus, round which the symbols
are placed. In this last belief the writer fully agrees with him; at the
same time it is evident Heydemann is not a careful observer, for he
asserts that the plaque of Sir W. Temple (Fig. [181](#img_37100).md) and
that of Mongelli at Naples (Fig. [183](#img_37300).md) are certainly from
the same model. It has been stated that the Berlin terra cotta
(published in the *Gazette Archéologique*) in general arrangement
resembles that at Oxford (Fig. [182](tee11.htm#img_27300).md), but in
addition there is a border with a pattern like that on the Barone lamp.
Moreover, this lamp is of almost the exact size of all the known
terracotta moulds of this sort, while of course the figures

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

upon the Barone and all other lamps are raised by having been shaped in
a concave mould. Looking then at the great demand there must have been
for lamps of all kinds, and at the peculiar and exactly similar shapes
of these moulds found in various places to that of the lamp, Fig.
[184](#img_37800.md); looking also to the fact that lamps so frequently
bore objects upon them which were obviously intended as amulets; we have
little hesitation in setting aside all the other theories advanced, and
maintaining that these were the moulds with which the potter shaped the
top of the peculiar flat-shaped lamp shown on Fig. [184](#img_37800.md). In
the specimen we have, there is a round hole just below Fortuna's arm, to
pour in the oil. In forming a lamp from the other moulds, the maker
would cut a round hole in the soft clay just in the centre, at the spot
where in each mould there is left a suitable umbilicus. There is no
evidence whatever that the sacrificial cakes bore any such devices as
are upon these plaques. [Moreover](errata.htm#1.md), the symbols are so
small that in a material like dough they would have simply appeared as
shapeless, meaningless excrescences, whereas the plaster cast at Oxford
shows that in a fine material like terra cotta each symbol comes out in
convex form, distinct and fairly sharp, merely requiring the ordinary
hand trimming to make it as clear and distinct as the representations
upon the many lamps in our museums, and especially on that of Barone at
Naples. The border pattern upon the Berlin mould completely destroys the
sacred cake theory. The plain border round our Oxford, Naples, and
British Museum specimens, would be pared off by the workman in fitting
the soft top on to the body of the lamp.

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is of course
possible that bronze also may have been cast in these moulds, for the
many specimens of the Mano Pantea are all cast in a mould of some sort,
and the symbols upon them have been dressed and trimmed afterwards, just
as the statuettes of bronze or of terra cotta have been finished up
after being cast. These things could no more have been used for sacred
cakes than the other moulds exhibited alongside them at Oxford-from
which ornamental plaques, statuettes, and other artistic objects have
been made.

The lamps they were intended to shape were of the commonest form, and
lent themselves conveniently to the collocation of a number of symbols
such as are found on these moulds, as well as upon many lamps. We submit
they were intended, in the same way as the more costly bronze hands, to
display constantly an assemblage of amulets in a cheap material
analogous to the wax *ex votos* now seen in churches, as compared with
the very same objects often alongside them in more costly silver.

Somewhat allied to the remarkable terra-cotta plates we have been
discussing is the curious tablet illustrated in Pignorius, <span
id="fr_639"></span>[608](#fn_639) of which Fig. [185](#img_38300.md) is a
copy. Many of the objects drawn upon it are very obscure, yet amongst
them are some we recognise as old acquaintances; and there can be little
doubt of the whole being a protective amulet against the evil eye, and
that it is a veritable Mensa Isiaca. The head probably represents a
skull, or possibly it may be the same person as the bust in Fig.
[181](#img_37100.md). Over it is the mystic eye. The triangle, whether with
base or apex downward, is a well-

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

known phallic symbol. Both occur upon this plate. The typical hoe or
plough shown upon Egyptian *ushebtiu* (Figs. [1,
2](tee04.htm#img_05000).md) and in the hands of Isis, Fig.
[172](#img_36000.md), with more than one *crux ansata*, and two arms with
hands palm tip, are all very plain.

On this the Editor remarks in a note: "This is the common belief about
rue, but I have found no good in it. I have read in the *Trino Magico*
that he who keeps the ortica along with the millefoil is secure against
incantation, I know nothing of it."

<span id="fn_596"></span>[347:570](tee14.htm#fr_596.md) There are various
opinions as to the reason for calling it the "herb of grace." One is
apparently formed upon Shakespeare's use of the word in *Hamlet* (Act
iv. Sc. 5): "We may call it herb-grace o' Sundays"; that "it was used on
Sundays by the Romanists in their exorcisms" (Brand, vol. iii. p. 315);
but there is no evidence of this, and Shakespeare uses the term several
times without any reference to Sundays.

. . . Here in this place  
I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace  
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,  
In the remembrance of a weeping queen,  
                                  (*Richard II*. Act iii. Sc. 4)

has hardly a Sunday flavour. The notion that rue was the "bitter herb"
with which the Passover was to be eaten as a sign of repentance seems
but little better.

The quotation from Bishop Taylor, in Webster, as to "trying the devil
with holy water," or in Johnson, from Miller, "An herb of grace, because
holy water was sprinkled with it," are equally unsatisfactory; and until
something better is found by Dr. Murray for the *N.E.D.* we must leave
the question amongst our *insoluta*.

[Fig. 163](#img_34900.md) of Diana Triformis is from Jahn, p. 87. Apart
from its illustrating the same idea that we see so constantly carried
out in Indian statues--several heads and arms upon one body--it shows a
quaint custom of ancient Rome, where, as the inscriptions show, they
used to set up figures of the gods in places not to be desecrated or
polluted: in fact to answer the same purpose as the modern police
notices in London or Paris. Besides the inscription on the base of the
panel here shown, Juvenal records another: "Ad cujus effigiem non tantum
meiere fas est." The Romans appealed to religion to enforce sanitation.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[350:577](tee14.htm#fr_603.md) In the confusion of
the various deities, many of the most opposite qualities have been
ascribed to one and the same personality, until all individuality may be
said to have been completely lost. We read (*Symbolica Dianæ Ephesiæ*,
p. 19): "Isidis, Cereris, Dianæ, et Cybeles attributa Lunæ etiam
adscribi." And again: "Hecate porro Diana, Luna, et Proserpina a Festo
et Diodoro Siculo pro uno eodemque numine accipiuntur. Exinde Diana
triformis fingebatur." Virgil (*Æn*. iv, 5, 11) also writes:--

"Tergeminamque Hecaten, tria virginis ora Dianæ."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Diana had also
the name of Trivia, by reason of the power she had over all ways"
(Montfaucon, vol. i. p. 16). This view would give another explanation to
the three diverging branches of the Cimaruta.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[351:580](tee14.htm#fr_606.md) The amulet ([Fig.

"Hinc Neurospasta apud Lucianum, et remedium, præbiave in collo pueris

<span id="fn_607"></span>[351:581](tee14.htm#fr_607.md) Besides being
associated with Diana, the serpent was an attribute of another goddess.
Minerva or Athena is represented as accompanied by a serpent. "The Tower
of Athens, which was guarded by a serpent . . . this serpent which
guarded the house stood by the door" (Montfaucon, vol. i. p. 85). This
completely accords with what we have remarked as to the serpent being
placed at the entrances of tombs and temples; but on the Cimaruta as an
infant's amulet the serpent has more probably to do with health than
with the guardianship of doors, although, as we shall see immediately,
even in that respect it typified Diana. Hygeia, the goddess of health,
is represented as sitting on a rock with a serpent coiled in her lap,
<span id="page_352">p. 352</span> opening its mouth to seize a pot of
ointment in her left hand (Montfaucon, Vol. i. p. 181).

houses. "Nigidius assures us that Apollo is Janus, and Diana, Jana; and
that the key is their proper attribute" (Montfaucon, Vol. i. p. 16). In
one of her three forms she holds a key in her hand.

Gnostic god Abraxas, and hence the cock may symbolise any one of them.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[355:589](tee14.htm#fr_616.md) In addition to Isis
and her descendants, the lotus is sacred to Lateshmi, who, as the
partner of Vishnu, is the goddess of prosperity, or the Indian
Abundantia. The flower in Egyptian mythology was also sacred to Horns,
who is very commonly represented seated on a lotus. In King's *Gems*
this is quite a favourite subject, also in *Abraxas*, etc.

The lotus was also the symbol of the Roman Ceres, the corn goddess, the
type of plenty. Lotus-seeds were mixed along with wheat-ears in the
cornucopia of Amalthea, the she-goat, the very emblem of abundance.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[355:589a](tee14.htm#fr_617.md) Probably there are

<span id="fn_620"></span>[359:592](tee14.htm#fr_620.md) As to the mere word
Siren, the meaning is not of much consequence, for women's long,
trailing skirts were formerly called Sirens. A horrible, discordant
instrument giving a warning hoot from a lightship is called a Siren. The
frog amulet in Naples is called a Siren: "Nos toiles de soie . . . si
fines et si diaphanes, q'à peine les voyoit-on sur le nud, sont
appellées Syrènes par Hesychius" (*Les Sirènes*, Paris, 1691, p. 48).

*Nat. Hist.* V. 290, Bohn).

Pliny says: "Branches of coral hung at the necks of infants are thought
to act as a preservative against danger" (*Nat. Hist.* xxxii. ii. vol.

The bee will be seen upon the Mano Pantea ([Fig.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[381:605b](tee14.htm#fr_636.md) Minervini's
opinion is not supported by evidence. We see on the Mano Pantea and on
the Cimaruta the same deity typified by two different symbols. Moreover,
on the gem, Fig. [17](tee06.htm#img_13001.md), the same symbol, the bee, is
repeated twice over. Again, on the week-day gem (Fig.
[19](tee06.htm#img_13100).md) every one of the symbols may be construed to
represent one or other of two deities only. See also the sacred *baris*
(Fig. [180](#img_36900)), and Diana (Fig. [69](tee08.htm#img_18800).md).
