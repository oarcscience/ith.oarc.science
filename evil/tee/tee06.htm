<p>IF so many strange beliefs still exist in these days of science and enlightenment, it is easy to see how in olden times a fanciful people, full of imagination, who personified not only every aspect of nature, but every virtue and every vice, got to look upon the trees or animals they thought sacred, as symbols of the deity to whom they were sacred. Perhaps of all nations we English are the most materialistic and matter of fact, yet in what endless ways do we even now make use of symbols, to denote not only objects, but events and abstract ideas! Every letter that we write or print is said to be the survival of some primitive picture, and thus to be the symbol of a separate idea. In Christian art symbolism occupies as large a place, as in the pagan mythology of old. A figure holding a key with sometimes a cock in the background is at once known as St. Peter; a man in a boat typifies Noah; a figure with a loaf and a basket signifies the feeding of the multitude; the fish is a symbol of our Lord, said to be a Greek acrostic as well as a sign; the dove represents the Holy Spirit; the cross is a symbol not only of a great event, but of a great doctrinal fact; while the hand, or <i>Dextera Dei</i>, of which we have much to</p> 
<p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></A></p> 
<p>say, represents power, and thereby the person of the Almighty Father.</p> 
<p>Even latter-day Puritans, "who are eager to banish the cross and the crucifix, with everything that has to them even a faint association with the terrible word idolatry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">182</FONT></A> accept that most symbolic of romances, <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, as a true exemplar of their special views," and thus provide the best possible evidence that no religious feeling worthy of the name will consent to live without some imaginative expression for those urgent and intimately varied spiritual yearnings, for which there is no definite and rigidly accurate language.</p> 
<p>This love of symbol and the eagerness for its artistic use are said to be rapidly reviving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">183</FONT></A>--a fact which does but prove how history repeats itself, and that the primitive notions of mankind are constantly reasserting themselves; that we are but now readopting the methods which have prevailed intermittently throughout all human time.</p> 
<p>In this way we get a clue to the primitive use of emblems and symbols by way of protection, against evils that people believed might be averted, through the intervention of the powers or divinities to whom they specially appealed; hence the reverence for, the half-worship of, the symbols representing those powers to their own minds. Moreover the uncultured mind does not readily discriminate between the symbol itself and the person, object, or fact which it is intended to represent.</p> 
<p>In view of the looseness with which words of</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A></p> 
<p>different significance are often used to represent the same ideas, and, on the other hand, the same word used to imply different meanings, it is well here to define what we mean by emblem and symbol. Curiously both words were originally derived from concrete objects, very far removed from the ideas they ultimately came to signify. <i>Symbol</i> properly means the separate contribution of each person towards the cost of a Greek drinking party. To ensure due payment it was customary for each person to pledge his signet ring to the caterer, to be redeemed on his paying his share of the bill. This custom was also adopted by the Romans, and by the time of Plautus the ring itself had got to be called <i>symbolum</i>. The signet ring having thus become the most easily available, as well as trustworthy of credentials, <i>symbolum</i> developed quickly into signifying the credential itself. From this, by a further development, in ecclesiastical language, as in the <i>Symbolum Apostolicum</i>, it expressed a definite <i>creed</i>, and at last has become a term for the conveyance of any idea, but more particularly of such as appertains to religious belief. We may now define a symbol as a means of conveying ideas and facts to the mind, through representations more or less pictorial. By constant repetition these pictures become in a way so conventionalised and stereotyped, that the mere portrayal, or even the mere mention, of a certain object conveys a distinct and well-defined train of thought to the mind.</p> 
<p>An <i>emblem</i> was an inlaid or raised ornament on a vessel, but inasmuch as the subjects of the designs were always figures of persons, generally mythological, so the word <i>emblem</i> came to imply representation,</p> 
<p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></A></p> 
<p>more or less allegorical, of some person or attribute personified; and in the end, by the same process of repetition, the emblem became conventionalised like the symbol, so that certain representations always conveyed to the beholder the idea of a certain fact or event, or of some being, or personification; with this difference, that the <i>emblem</i> expressed more fully and distinctly, while the <i>symbol</i> only hinted at the idea conveyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">184</FONT></A> To make what we mean more clear, the crucifix is an emblem, a dramatic representation of a great event, carrying with it all its history and consequences, while the simple cross is a symbol no less expressive, but yet conveying by a mere hint all the history, all the doctrine, all the significance, of the more elaborate representation.</p> 
<p>Justice, again, as an <i>emblem</i> is represented as a blindfolded female figure, holding the sword of punishment in one hand, with the balance of judgment in the other. As a <i>symbol</i> of justice, either the <i>sword</i>, or the <i>balance</i> alone, conveys the idea, though in a more abstract form. Victory, too, has for her <i>emblem</i> a winged female figure holding a wreath or a palm branch, while the <i>symbol</i> of victory is the wreath or the palm alone.</p> 
<p>It will be readily understood how a <i>symbol</i> may be easily developed from an actual pictorial <i>emblem</i>, into a mere description, either spoken or by gesture acted, so as to convey the same idea. Thus when the hand is raised in the act of benediction, the three</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="green">p. 119</font></A></p> 
<p>extended fingers are the well-known symbol of the Holy Trinity; so when we speak of bearing the cross, wearing the wreath or the palm, we symbolise and convey our meaning just as clearly as though those symbols were actually painted or carved.</p> 
<p>Precisely as a miniature in a locket brings back to the wearer the individuality of the person portrayed, so does the symbolic representation of the deity, whose aid is sought, bring back to the mind of the beholder the whole conception of the attributes and power of the being so represented. An ancient Roman believed that Juno would protect him against certain dangers; forthwith he paints or carves a peacock, her own bird, and is thus reminded of her. In theory he prays to her as often as he looks upon her symbol, while he honours or worships her by wearing it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">185</FONT></A></p> 
<p>The practice, if not the belief, still survives amongst us.</p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Some eight or ten years ago a gentleman well known to me went to call on an intimate friend of his. Unfortunately for him, he had the eye of a peacock's feather in his hat. When the lady of the house saw it, she snatched it from him and threw it out of the hall-door, rating him as if he had been guilty of some great moral offence.</p> 
<p>Some years ago, in North Yorkshire, an old servant came to the house where I was, and found some peacocks' feathers above the mantelpiece in one of the bedrooms. She expressed her horror to the young ladies of the house, and said that they need never expect to be married if they kept such things for ornaments.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">186</FONT></A></p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="green">p. 120</font></A></p> 
<p>In Shropshire also it is believed to be very unlucky to bring peacocks' feathers into the house.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A></p> 
<p>No doubt the belief that to keep peacocks' feathers is unlucky, comes from the ancient cult of Juno--her anger being in some way excited by the plucking of the feathers of her favourite bird; while the idea that so long as they are kept in the house no suitors will come for the daughters, points to the old attribute of spite and jealousy in love or matrimonial matters, with which that goddess was always accredited.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A></p> 
<p>From keeping and using such objects or signs, as reminders of the worship due to the beings symbolised, the history of the word <i>symbol</i> shows that it is but a very short step to the belief in the efficacy of the symbol itself, and hence we are led to the universal use of what have been of old called amulets.</p> 
<p>These are described&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A> as "anything worn about the person as a charm or preventive against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft," etc. In Smith's <i>Dictionary of Antiquities</i> we find it said that the word signified something suspended, and that it was used for objects such as a stone, plant, artificial production, or piece of writing, which was suspended from the neck, or tied to any part of the body--seemingly ignoring the many other uses of amulets both ancient and modern. Even in Pliny's time amulets were not merely worn, but were used as ornaments or objects having special purposes, fixed or otherwise, as they are to this day, about the houses, carriages, and fields of widely diverse races. The word <i>amulet</i> is nowadays very</p>

<p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A></p> 
<p>commonly used as synonymous with talisman, whereas in meaning it is entirely distinct. The latter means a "sigil engraved in stone or metal,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A> and it served a double purpose, namely, "to procure love, and to avert mischief from its possessor," while an <i>amuletum</i>, derived from <i>amolior</i> to do away with, or to baffle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">190a</FONT></A> had for its sole end the protection of the owner. Pliny, writing on the cyclamen (<i>tuberterr&aelig;</i>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A> says, it "ought to be grown in every house, if it be true that wherever it grows noxious spells can have no effect. This plant is also what is called an <i>amulet</i>." Boccaccio speaks of "the skull of an ass set up on a pole in a cornfield as a potent amulet against blight." As a modern parallel to this we are told that at Mourzak, in Central Africa, the people set up the head of an ass in their gardens to avert the evil eye from their crops.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">192</FONT></A></p>

When we come to speak of the Cimaruta and the specific charms used in Italy, we shall see clearly that this relief can only be intended as an amulet. Abundant evidence will be produced later on to show that amulets were used also as household ornaments, much as we now use vases and other nicknacks upon our chimney-pieces and tables. It is very probable that the teraphim, translated <i>images</i> in our Authorised Version,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">196</FONT></A> which Rachel stole from Laban, were really amulets of the kind not to be worn, but used as protecting objects; these, like the Lares and Penates of subsequent times, were looked upon almost as objects of worship, though not as actual gods. Indeed we can have no reason to believe Laban idolatrous, or that Rachel carried them off with the intention of worshipping them. Still it is evident they were highly prized.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">197</FONT></A></p>

<p>We are told&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">198</FONT></A> that "the ear-rings" mentioned in Gen. xxxv. 4 and Hosea ii. 13 were really amulets, and were connected with idolatrous worship. Amulets, however, were mostly worn round the neck, or rather suspended from a necklace and forming its centrepiece. We find this custom coming down to us here in England, through the classic and Middle Ages to our own times, though just now out of fashion, in the various lockets containing hair, etc., with other articles of a like kind forming the central ornament of necklaces. In some</p>

<p>countries these things are still worn, not as mere ornaments, but avowedly as protective amulets against dread fascination. By no means were all hung round the neck, for the phylacteries which were worn as the "frontlets between thine eyes" (Exodus xiii. 16) were true amulets. One kind of phylactery was bound upon the bend of the left arm, and the other on the forehead. They were little leather boxes containing strips of parchment on which were written the four following passages of Scripture, called the Tetragrammaton, namely, Exod. xiii. 2-10 and 11-16; Deut. vi. 4-9 and xi. 13-21. They were certainly worn by all Jews over thirteen years of age in the time of our Lord.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">199</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Slips from the Koran, the Scriptures, or other writings, are now worn on the person, or upon horses and camels, by Arabs, Turks, Abyssinians,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">200</FONT></A> Greeks, Italians, and even English. They are all avowedly worn for the purpose of averting the evil eye; and seeing that the dread of it was perhaps even greater in old days than now, it seems but reasonable to assume that the direct object of the biblical phylactery was then, as it is to-day, to baffle the malignant glance.</p> 
<p>It is curious that Turks, and, indeed, all Mahomedans, once used animals and figures of men, representing various deities, as amulets against fascination, but since their conversion from heathenism they have discarded most of these, and now wear sentences from the Koran, avowedly to guard them against the evil eye. Little silver cases to contain them, such as are shown on <A HREF="tee11.htm#img_25900">Fig. 112</A>, <A HREF="tee11.htm#page_259">p. 259</A>,</p>

<p>It was said by Plutarch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">201</FONT></A> that when Isis brought into the world Harpocrates, the posthumous son of Osiris, she wore an amulet round her neck, in the shape of a <i>vase</i>, the "emblem of Ma," the goddess of truth. The vase was also a symbol of Osiris.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">201a</FONT></A> This vase represented water; hence the vivifying power of nature, <i>i.e.</i> Osiris the personification of the Nile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">202</FONT></A> which was thus typified by a vase.</p> 
<p>Among the ancient Egyptians not only were protecting amulets worn by the living, but in that land where the belief in a future life seemed to absorb so much of the care and interest of the present, they placed them in profusion on their dead, in order that they might be protected from evil spirits and the blighting eye, during the dark passage from this world to the next.</p>

The commonest of all Egyptian amulets, except the scarab, was that known to English people as the Eye of Osiris: "L'&#156;il mystique (<A HREF="#img_12600">Fig. 10</A>), l'ouza lie au poignet ou <A NAME="img_12600"></A>

These scarabs and mystic eyes were worn equally by the living and the dead "as amulets against evil magic."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">204</FONT></A> Moreover the mystic eye appears everywhere painted on walls. One such, of especial size and prominence, is to be found over the door of one of the upper chambers in the temple of Denderah, and it is seen constantly as one of the hieroglyphics translated <i>ut'a</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">205</FONT></A></p> 
<p>We find the eye also used for two other signs in Egyptian writing.

<p>It was natural from the association of idea with fact, or "sympathetic magic," that representations of the eye itself should among all people have been considered potent amulets against its malign influence. The Ph&#156;nicians certainly used it as an amulet. In the Museum at Carthage, among the objects found in the ancient tombs, there are <A NAME="img_12700"></A>

These were all provided with eyelets for suspension. Precisely the same thing was, in 1889, to be seen in the Ashmolean Museum, from Beirut, showing it to have been a common object among the Ph&#156;nicians. Similar amulets are to be seen in the museums of the Louvre and at Athens. The Etruscans also had an amulet of this kind. The head itself is said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">208</FONT></A> to be that of a panther, and from the number of specimens of this identical amulet which the writer has seen in various museums, brought from widely separated countries, yet all in the track of the Ph&#156;nicians, we may take it as established, that <A NAME="img_12701"></A>

<p>In the Louvre among the gems is a medal-shaped amulet (<A HREF="#img_12701">Fig. 12</A>), with an eye alone in the centre; and Jahn gives several other examples of the single eye used as an amulet, especially in two necklaces drawn on Taf. V. of his article. In one, the eye is</p>

<p>As we proceed with the consideration of the various charms and amulets used by ancients and moderns alike, we shall find that not only were single objects, such as the eye, the hand, and many others to which we shall refer later, used as such, but that there was a combination, a sort of piling up of emblems and symbols, so that we constantly find objects of a highly composite character differing very essentially in their several component parts, but yet on the whole presenting a sort of similarity; while it is perfectly obvious that the design or purpose of these compound amulets was in all cases the same.</p> 
<p>We shall endeavour to discover as we go on what was the special import of each item of these many compounds, and as far as possible to decide what deity was typified by the several representations made use of--for at the outset we postulate that every one of the symbols used, does definitely represent some deity or other personification, who was believed by the possessor of the amulet to be a protector against maleficent influence. The combination</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A></p> 
<p>of symbols we find to be as various both in number and description, whether we take ancient or modern dates, as is now the cult of the various saints in the calendar; so that when we find an amulet of unusually complex character, bearing a great number of symbolic figures, we may take it to be the prototype and the equivalent of the latter-day summing up of "All Saints" or "all the company of heaven." A singular comment upon this accumulation of protectors is seen' in an inscription of the first year of our Christian era, A.U.C. 754, found quite recently in the Tiber near the Church of Sta. Lucia della Tinta.</p> 
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Under the consulship of Caius Caesar and Lucius Paulus, a freedman named Lucius Lucretius Zethus was warned in a vision by Jupiter, to raise an altar in honour of Augustus, under the invocation of "Mercurius Deus &AElig;ternus." Following these directions, Lucretius Zethus had the altar made, and unwilling apparently to hurt the feelings of the gods in general, dedicated it not only to Mercury Augustus, but at the same time to Jupiter, Juno, Minerva, the sun, the moon, Apollo, Diana, Fortune, Ops, Isis, Piety and the Fates. From an epigraphic point of view, this monument ranks among the very best discovered in the works of the Tiber.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">210</FONT></A></p> 
<p>A great number of ancient compound amulets in the shape of marble reliefs, medals and engraved gems, have been found, in which an eye is the central object, while grouped around it are various animals or other emblems of protecting divinities.</p> 
<p>Jahn in his well-known paper gives no less than six different medals and gems, which have for each the eye as a centre, surrounded by a greater or less numerous grouping of symbolic figures, and all are undoubted amulets of ancient date against the evil eye.</p> 
<p>No. 2 in Jahn is taken from Caylus rec. vi, 38,</p>

<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p> 
<p>On this blood-red gem King remarks (<i>Gnostics</i>, p. 238) that it shows "the evil eye surrounded by antidotes against its influence for every day in the week, in the attribute of the deity presiding over each, namely, the lion for <i>dies Solis</i>, the stag for <i>dies Lun&aelig;</i> (<i>Diana venatrix</i>), the scorpion for <i>dies Martis</i>, the dog for <i>dies Mercurii</i>, etc." To these we must add the thunderbolt for <i>dies Jovis</i>. The owl, however, was sacred to Athene or Minerva, and must have been substituted as the symbol of <i>dies Veneris</i>, for Venus does not seem to have been regarded as a protectress against fascination, unless we look upon her as identical with Isis, Ishtar, and Diana; whereas Minerva, the bearer of the Gorgon's head, was always one of the most potent protecting deities. The serpent, too, was the symbol of Hecate,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">214</FONT></A> one of the attributes, as we shall see later, of Diana Triformis, and was considered one of the most powerful of all the antidotes. Scarcely any compound amulet occurs without the serpent, and hence we must suppose in the case we are considering that it was adopted as the symbol applicable to <i>dies Saturni</i>. &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">214a</FONT></A></p> 
<p>In considering this gem, we must not forget its Gnostic character, and that its origin was Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian, though the work of a European hand.</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Hence every symbol must be interpreted as Egyptian from a Greek point of view. Now as we know, and as Pliny&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">215</FONT></A> long ago related that there are no stags in Africa, it is clear that the designer of this amulet must have denoted by the stag a deity of the Gr&aelig;co-Roman mythology; and we must therefore look for one whose prototype is to be found in Egypt, and whose attributes were the same as the Ephesian Diana whom undoubtedly the stag represented in his idea. This could be no other than Hathor, whom we must look upon like Diana, as distinctly a moon goddess.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">216</FONT></A> So the thunderbolt, in like manner, would represent Serapis, the great Sun-god.</p> 
<p>Thus considered, every one of the symbols on this week-day amulet ultimately resolves itself into one or other of the great Gnostic gods, the Sun and Moon.</p> 
<p>The use of the eye as the central object in amulets involving sympathetic magic, may be taken to be universal. "Arab amulets at the present day bear the figure of the thing against which they exert their virtue, and all oriental practices in this line come down from immemorial antiquity."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">217</FONT></A></p>

<p>are specially in dread of the evil eye, and being a maritime people too, we should look for marks of this in connection with their principal calling, for perils by the sea are everywhere believed to be constant sources of danger subject to maleficent influence. Consequently we find the native boats, as a regular part of their decoration, have a large eye painted on each side of the bows, giving them a very weird and uncanny appearance, much enhanced by the high prolongation of the stem. The same kind of stem is seen in the Neapolitan boats, though without the eyes.</p> 
<p>The writer has seen boats having eyes on either side of the prow in some other places, at Smyrna, or one of the Greek ports, but having missed his note cannot recall at which port it was. This custom is evidently of great antiquity. The eye was placed on boats by the ancient Egyptians,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">218</FONT></A> and also by the Etruscans.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">219</FONT></A> Dennis remarks:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">220</FONT></A> "The presence of eyes on the bows of ancient vessels, perhaps originating in the fancied analogy with fish, or to intimate the vigilance necessary to the pilot, is well known--'they were charms against the evil eye.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">221</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Besides the conventional <i>ouza</i> or <i>&#156;il mystique</i> already referred to, the Egyptians wore eyes as amulets of a more realistic character. They were in pairs, looking fully to the front, and were pierced</p>

<p>Perhaps the most noteworthy of all the amulets in which the eye forms the central object in combination with several other emblems, is the very remarkable relief illustrated in Millingen's paper in vol. xix. of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, p. 74, and referred to by Jahn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">225</FONT></A> It is one of the Woburn marbles (<A HREF="#img_13700">Fig. 24</A>) in the collection of the Duke of Bedford, and measures 1'6" x 1'5", but this last dimension is not perfect, being broken on the left side. There was a framing, and it is usually thought to have been built into a wall, as a house-decoration, but still more as a protection. The centre is a large human eye, and, as Jahn says, "the left, which may be considered a special feature of its sinister intention, and moreover the pupil is strongly marked."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">226</FONT></A> Over it is a very prominent eyelid and an arched brow. Above this is seated a beardless man in a Phrygian cap, with his back towards the spectator, and his head turned backwards. He is squatted down with both hands on his knees, has his shirt pulled up, and strikingly exemplifies the description of Pomponius:--</p><dir> <dir>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">"Hoc sciunt omnes quantum est qui cossim cacant."</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">227</FONT></A></p></dir> </dir>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Moreover it is evident that he is in that position which even now conveys in its full reality (in England no less than in Germany) the common</p>

<p>typical expression of the utmost contempt.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">228</FONT></A> In fact, the figure is sitting on the eye in a most indecorous position, and as we explain later, any object or gesture which gave rise to an indecent or obscene idea was looked upon as specially effective in the way of a protection against fascination. One cannot help once more remarking here, how strikingly this mockery of the evil eye, this challenging of its malignity in the old Roman days of Septimius Severus, to which period this marble is ascribed, are reproduced in this enlightened nineteenth century by the heroic performances of the "Thirteen Club." Surely the dinner with its brave defiance of the Fates is a very eloquent and convincing piece of evidence that so-called civilisation, enlightenment, culture and all the rest of it, have not even yet eradicated the feeling, which has existed in man's breast from the remotest antiquity-that there is a power, an influence, a something passing from certain persons to others, which though unseen, unfelt, unmeasured and incapable of explanation, at least is dreaded by many, and perhaps most by some of those who scoff loudest, and outwardly defy it most ostentatiously.</p> 
<p>It is well known that at the present day Neapolitan and other Italian sailors use this same identical attitude, turning themselves thus towards a contrary wind, in the belief that by such contemptuous defiance of the adverse spirit of the wind, its direction may be changed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">229</FONT></A></p>

<p>On the right of the spectator in our illustration is another figure with his face turned towards the Phrygian, the former appears to be a gladiator wearing the distinctive girdle called the <i>subligaculum</i>. In his right hand is the trident, with which he seems to stab the eye, and in his left a short sword&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">230</FONT></A> (<i>fuscina</i>). The yoke-like object on his left shoulder, and the armlet he wears, recognised as the <i>galerus</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">231</FONT></A> prove that he was a <i>Retiarius</i>, one of those who fought with a net, which he tried to throw over his opponent the <i>Mirmillo</i>, so as to entangle him and his shield; and then he attacked him with the trident. The <i>Retiarius</i>, moreover, used to fight bare-headed like the figure here. There was most likely (Jahn says, <i>ohne Zweifel</i>) a figure on the opposite side of the bas-relief, which is now broken off, and it is here suggested that the latter may have represented the opposing <i>Mirmillo</i>, though Jahn says nothing upon that subject.</p> 
<p>On the lower part of the marble are five animals seemingly attacking the eye with great fury. These are a lion, a serpent, a scorpion, a crane, and a raven or crow--each one a distinct amulet in itself.</p> 
<p>Millingen remarks that no doubt can be entertained but that the evil eye or <i>fascinum</i> is here represented, and in this opinion he is fully supported</p>

<p>It was usual to ornament the coffins or mummy cases of the ancient Egyptians with two large open eyes, with two monumental doors on the left, while on the right they placed three doors.

<p>Except upon Maltese and some other boats, or in masonic symbolism, the eye seems to have passed out of modern use, and as an amulet almost exclusively to be a thing of the past; even among the ancients it was by no means the commonest emblem used against its own influence. Eyes, however, made of wax or silver are extremely common to-day as <i>ex votos</i>--hung up in churches, before <i>Notre Dame de bon secours</i>, and some other favourite saints, such as SS. Cosmo e Damiano. We must ever bear in mind that it was, and continues to be, believed that the first glance of the evil eye was the</p>

<p>most fatal, and therefore it was of the utmost importance that any object intended to protect against its influence should be such as should attract the first or fatal stroke; for it was just as firmly held, that whatever diverted it for the moment from the person or animal liable to injury, absorbed and so destroyed its effect. Anything, therefore, calculated to excite the curiosity, the mirth, or in any way to attract the attention of the beholder was considered to be the most effectual. There were three methods generally accepted for averting fascination, whether it were of look, voice, touch, or bodily presence of the fascinator.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">237</FONT></A> These were, by exciting laughter or curiosity; by demonstration of good fortune so as to excite envy in the beholder and so to draw his evil glance upon the object displayed; and by doing something painfully disagreeable to cause him an unpleasant feeling of dread lest he, the fascinator, should be compelled to do likewise.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">238</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Plutarch in a remarkable passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">239</FONT></A> declares that the objects that are fixed up to ward off witchcraft or fascination, derive their efficacy from the fact that they act through the strangeness and ridiculousness of their forms, which fix the mischief-working eye upon themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">240</FONT></A></p>

<p>In treating of amulets it behoves us to give an early place in our consideration to that which of all others may be taken as the first, the original germ,</p>

<p>at least so far as noticeable in Greek art--the head of the Medusa, or as it is commonly called, the Gorgoneion.</p> 
<p>The story of Perseus and of his killing the Medusa, whom he only ventured to look at in a mirror, need not here be detailed, but in it we have at least a very early incident in the prim&aelig;val belief in the evil eye. So far as Greek art goes, we have in the hideous representation of her dog-toothed, split-tongued visage, the earliest example which we can positively assert to be a prophylactic charm against the fatal glance which she was believed to have possessed; for though there are plenty of Egyptian</p> 
<p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A></p> 
<p>amulets of earlier date, it cannot be certainly declared what was their precise intention. This very remarkable object is of so much importance that we must make it a subject to be treated apart;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">244</FONT></A> suffice it here to say that from being the earliest of amulets known to European art, so the illustration on <A HREF="tee07.htm#page_160">p. 160</A>, <A HREF="tee07.htm#img_16000">Fig. 49</A>, shows it to be one of the latest, if not the latest, used in Christian times to baffle the evil eye. We also see by the same illustration that it is one of the most debased among the many examples of declining art. It is of course out of our province, and beyond our ability, to decide whence the Greeks obtained the story, and we must leave that question to experts who are content to contract more narrowly their investigations. The obvious development of the early idea of the Gorgon's head, from its first conception of the intensest ugly frightfulness, until it became at last by the gradual refinement of taste, as shown in classic art, the ideal of female beauty, culminating in the well-known Strozzi Medusa,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">245</FONT></A> demands careful attention.</p> 
<p>The step from the famous death-dealing visage, as a protection against the very evil it was believed to produce, is but short to that of hideous faces in general; and hence we find that strange and contorted faces or masks were certainly used as objects to attract the evil eye, and so to absorb its influence, and to protect the person wearing or displaying the mask. The very origin of the name <i>mask</i> is said to be but</p> 
<p>

<p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A></p> 
<p>a corruption of the older Greek &#0946;&#0945;&#0963;&#0954;&#0945;, whence &#0946;&#0945;&#0963;&#0954;&#0945;&#0957;&#0943;&#0945;, <i>fascina</i> or amulets. "From this custom of regarding hideous masks as amulets can be explained a circumstance otherwise a problem to every archaeologist--the vast number of such subjects we meet with in antique gems."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">246</FONT></A> Not only so, but their importance is still more impressed upon us by the fact that the highest skill known to Roman art was lavished upon the engraving of masks.</p> 
<p>Nothing, as is well known of all ages, so much attracts or excites curiosity as obscenity and indecency;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">247</FONT></A></p>

<p>and hence of all amulets, those partaking of this character were the most potent, and therefore the most used. Anything strange, odd, or uncommon, as likely to attract the eye, was considered most effectual, and consequently the objects viewed as protective against it were almost infinite in number. For the reasons given we find in compounded amulets that the commonest of all objects was the phallus, or some other, suggesting the ideas conveyed by it.</p>

</p> 
<p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A></p> 
<p>Amulets then which protect against the power of fascination would naturally be of three classes. First, those whose intention was to attract upon themselves the malignant glance. These were necessarily either worn on the outside of the dress, or openly exposed to view like the grillo of Pisistratus at Athens, the brazen serpent set up by Moses, or the various household objects displayed for the same purpose. Secondly, there were all those charms, worn or carried secretly, or hidden beneath the dress; and thirdly, the written words of Scripture, Koran, and other sacred writings, or the cabalistic figures and formul&aelig; considered so powerful.</p> 
<p>The former class were the most numerous, and of them we have the greatest number of examples, both ancient and modern. For the reason above stated, amulets consisting alone of <i>das m&auml;nnliche Glied</i>, or compounded with it as the attractive feature, were so common that they obtained a technical name from the purpose they were intended to serve. The usual term among old writers was <i>fascinum</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_261"></A><A HREF="#fn_261"><FONT SIZE="1">248</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Other writers, especially Varro, call one particular form which was commonly suspended from the necks</p>

<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p> 
<p>of children <i>turpicula res</i>, <i>sc&aelig;va</i> or <i>sc&aelig;vola</i>, and he discusses at some length the development of the word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">249</FONT></A></p> 
<p>Dodwell (vol. ii. p. 34) says: "They are frequently found in Italy of bronze, and the other extremity of the symbol is terminated by a hand which is closed; the thumb protruding between the fore and middle fingers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">250</FONT></A></p> 
<p>This is but a very partial description of a most remarkable object much easier portrayed than described. It is of so obscene a character that it cannot here be reproduced.</p> 
<p>A full-sized illustration of one in bronze from the Dresden collection is given (p. 81) in Jahn's <i>Ueber den Aberglauben</i>, etc. It is evidently a pendant-amulet, having three extra eyelets, from which probably little bells were hung, such as will be seen later on in our illustrations of the Sirens and Sea-horses. One branch of the pendant consists of a phallus such as Frommannd describes (p. 5), <i>tam rigidum reddere quam cornu</i>; while to balance it, is an arm ending in a fist with the thumb protruding as stated by Dodwell. The central part or body is composed of another membrum, of the kind constantly found as a separate amulet. Any number of these may be seen both as amulets and as <i>ex votos</i> in the private Museum at Naples, and also in the Museum of the Collegio</p> 
<p>

<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Romano. A very beautiful specimen of a <i>turpicula res</i> is in one of the cases of antique jewellery in the Louvre Museum. It is of gold, and measures about an inch and a half wide, and itself forms the pendant to a complete necklace, having above it as part of the pendant a fine amethyst cut as a scarab. There may be others in other museums, but the above is by far the most elaborate known to me, and is a most interesting study. In the same case are several other amulets against the evil eye, among which is the medal (<A HREF="#img_12700">Fig. 12</A>).</p> 
<p>In the Naples Museum are many bronze examples of various sizes, but all similar in pattern; in all cases the thumb is between the first and second fingers. There are also many phalli with eyelet holes to enable them to be worn as charms.</p> 
<p>The vast antiquity of the phallic necklace can be easily demonstrated: it was very ancient even in the days of Horace and Varro; and it may be that the Romans got their <i>fascinum</i> from Egypt. In a recently discovered tomb at Thebes, near that of Rekhamara, the account of which has not yet found its way into the guide-books, the writer was struck by a singularly fresh and distinct painting of a necklace--the colour as bright as the day it was painted, more than three thousand years ago. It is formed of a chain fastened by a serpent's head, such as may be seen in our own shops to-day. The ornaments are three pendants--the phallus,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">251</FONT></A> the most conspicuous, in the centre, the symbol of stability, and the <i>ankh</i>, or symbol of life, on either side.</p> 
<p>
</p> 
<p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A></p> 
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The necklace so carefully painted is being presented by one female figure to another, but there are no special attributes by which to decide whom they are meant to represent. The attitude of the figures, and the prominence given to the three pendants of the offering, show that it was intended to be received and worn as a protective amulet.</p> 
<p>Although of course the <i>turpicula res</i> is no longer to be found in actual use, yet the fist with protruding thumb is to-day one of the commonest of objects <A NAME="img_15200"></A>

The complete survival of the ancient amulet is no longer permitted by the papal censors, but the hand-part of it is still the ordinary baby's sucker or plaything hung upon a child's neck in Rome, where of old the grosser object held its place. In fact this hand in silver is to the Roman child of to-day what our "coral and silver bells" was to us in our childhood--the regulation christening gift. <A HREF="#img_15200">Fig. 41</A> is from the writer's collection; actual size. It is of silver, and was bought in a shop close to the Campo dei Fiori, where it was one of a large bunch of at least twenty exposed for sale, showing that it is an article in large and regular demand. The same thing may be seen in almost any silversmith's shop out of the beat of the ordinary tourist. This special article seems to be confined to Rome and its neighbourhood, for, as we shall see later, something</p> 
<p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A></p> 
<p>very different is worn by the babies in Naples and Southern Italy.</p> 
<p>In making purchases of this and of the many other charms in the writer's possession, it has always been his practice to inquire of the seller what was the object of the article. In every case the answer has been the same--"<i>Contra malocchia</i>" in Rome; "<i>Contra la jettatura</i>" in Naples.</p> 
<p>The antiquity of the phallus as an amulet is shown by the number found among Egyptian sculptures. No visitor to Egyptian antiquities needs to be told this. Indeed, it was held to have been consecrated by Isis herself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">252</FONT></A> The phallus was the most sacred amulet worn by the vestal virgins of ancient Rome.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">253</FONT></A> Moreover, we find that Sesostris of the early twelfth dynasty, who conquered Asia, set up memorials of a phallic nature among the people who had acted bravely, but among the degenerate, female emblems engraved on <i>stel&aelig;</i> were set up.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">254</FONT></A> Who shall say these objects may not have been the origin of those still to be found so universally throughout India? In the ruins of Zimbabwe, in Central Africa, are to be seen phalli carved upon stone, similar to those found in Sardinia, which are said to be Ph&#156;nician.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_268"></A><A HREF="#fn_268"><FONT SIZE="1">255</FONT></A> The like have been seen by the writer on the so-called Ph&#156;nician ruins of Hajar Khem in Malta. Again, numbers of phallic amulets in bronze are found in the earliest Etruscan tombs as well as in the museums of the Collegio Romano, of Cortona and of Bologna, marked</p>

<p>as belonging to the <i>prima et&agrave; di ferro</i>--a time which, like Egyptian monuments, makes the objects of Classic Rome things of yesterday. The objects on <A HREF="#img_15400">Fig. 42</A> are in the Museum at Bologna. In the Naples Museum are a number of vases of different shapes, ornamented with vine leaves and tendrils</p>

<p>alternating with a phallus, forming a belt of decoration round the belly of the vase.</p> 
<p>The object described as <i>satirica signa</i> by Pliny, and so constantly referred to, appears not only upon the amulets of which the eye is the centre, but is that to be seen over so many of the doorways in Pompeii. It by no means signified that which the <i>ciceroni</i> now tell the tourist;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">255a</FONT></A> but was placed there as a protective amulet against fascination. We read&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_270"></A><A HREF="#fn_270"><FONT SIZE="1">256</FONT></A> that it was the common sign over a blacksmith's forge, and no doubt inasmuch as the horses who came to him to be shod were specially liable to the malign influence, so the smith would naturally provide the best possible protector for the animals by whom he got his living.</p> 
<p>"That such representations were placed by the ancients on the walls of their cities, there is no lack of proof.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">257</FONT></A>They are found on several of the early</p>

<p>cities of Italy and Greece, on masonry polygonal as well as regular." At Alatri it is tripled, sculptured in relief on the lintel of a postern or passage in the polygonal walls of the citadel. It is also tripled on the Pelasgic walls at Grottatore. Another is found on the ancient wall of Terra di Cesi, near Terni, and again on the ancient fortifications of Todi on the upper waters of the Tiber, where it is in high relief, and is well known as <i>il pezzo di marmo</i>. There is one on a block in the wall of Oea, in the island of Thera in the &AElig;gean Sea, with an inscription accompanying it, which distinctly proves it to have been intended to avert the evil eye. The same thing has been found on the doors of ancient tombs at Palazzuolo in Sicily, at Castel d'Asso in Etruria, and in the Catacombs of Naples. Of all places, however, the greatest number now to be seen are amongst the tombs and temples of Egypt.</p> 
<p>Jahn gives plates of a very remarkable kind, of objects sculptured on the amphitheatre at Nismes, to be seen at the Dresden and other museums; he pursues this subject at greater length than can be here followed. To have omitted all notice of it would have been to leave out really the part on which ancient and medi&aelig;val writers have dwelt longest; still it is unsavoury, and we are glad to have done with it, the more so as we have so many facts and objects to be found in the life of to-day which seem to have been singularly overlooked by those who have written on the evil eye.</p> 
<p>Repeated mention is made in these pages of the many amulets to be found in the Etruscan Museum at Bologna. Of the accompanying illustrations, <A HREF="#img_15600">Fig. 43</A> is taken from Burton's <i>Etruscan Bologna</i>,</p>

<p>very numerous handled half-moons of about the same size, found there and in other museums, which are well known to be ancient razors. In the object here shown, there is but one possible cutting edge, that at the bottom. <A HREF="#img_15601">Figs. 45, 46</A> represent an Etruscan coin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">258</FONT></A> of the town of Luna.

<p>were intended as amulets. The axe and sword were each considered to be such, while as to the two crescents, we may accept one as being a rebus of Luna, and the other to be the consort of the central solar disc. The head on the reverse may be the personification of the city or of Diana.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_208"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_208">122:197</A> Professor Huxley says (<i>Science and Hebrew Tradition</i>, 1893, p. 309): "The teraphim were certainly images of family gods, and as such in all probability represented deceased ancestors," and further that Jacob was not "scandalised by the idolatrous practices of his favourite wife . . . for the teraphim seem to have remained in his camp." Other authorities say (Reginald Stuart Poole in Smith's <i>Dict</i>. s.v. "Teraphim, Magic." Also W. Aldis <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A> Wright, s.v. "Nehushtan ") "there is no evidence that they were ever worshipped. "There seems to be a consensus of opinion that the teraphim, whatever they were, had much to do with magic. It is here suggested that many of the numberless little bronze statuettes, to be seen in various museums, probably represent the Teraphim of the Hebrews and the Lares of Rome, and are not mere ornaments. <A HREF="tee11.htm#img_24501">Fig. 105</A> is surely one of these, and its original cannot be later than the time of Jacob. The terra-cotta figures too, beginning with the crude forms found at Mycen&aelig;, and developing into the beautiful artistic statuettes of later Greece, must have been of the same character; for we cannot suppose that as mere ornaments they would have been so carefully deposited along with the dead. Nor does there appear to be any evidence that the Greeks or Romans ever imbibed the Egyptian notion of placing figures of this kind with the dead, as <i>ushebtiu</i>, to attend on the departed in the next world.</p> 
<p>It seems rather an assumption than a certainty that teraphim were images only of persons. It is suggested that among such may be included several other objects, looked upon as prophylactic, or otherwise sacred. The bronze bands, dealt with in the chapter on the Mano Pantea, would distinctly come into this category. Further we find proof of this in the point noticed by Huxley (p. 310), that it was not until the time of Hezekiah that the brazen serpent of Moses was destroyed. During the thousand years of its existence it had been preserved, and at length from a protective teraphim had become Nehushtan. All this seems to show that the brazen serpent, and all such objects as we now call amulets, like the grillo of Athens, the crocodiles of Seville and Venice, were not originally worshipped idolatrously, but were looked upon as magically endowed with the power of countervailing the effect of the malignant eye--the fertile source, as it was thought, of every evil to mankind.</p> 
<p>It has been well suggested (Farrar in Kitto's <i>Cyclop&aelig;dia of Biblical Literature</i>, s.v. "Teraphim") that the teraphim, and to them we would add protective symbols in general, were looked upon much in the same way that pictures and images are now looked upon by Roman Catholics, who indignantly repudiate the notion of idolatry. No doubt the denunciations of the prophets point to the same line of teaching as that of modern Protestants, who can perceive no difference between the reverence paid to the image itself, and that which all would admit to be due to the person depicted.</P>

"<i>Camahem</i> is a loadstone or fibrous h&aelig;matite, the usual material for Babylonish cylinders, and in use there down to the time of the Cufic signets. The Arabs knowing no other motive for engraving of stones than their conversion into talismans (amulets), gave the name of the one most frequently used to the whole class; and the Crusaders introduced it into all European languages in this sense. Matthew Paris has <i>lapides quos cameos vulgariter apellamus</i>, which marks its foreign origin" (King, <i>Gnostics</i>, p. 112). Mr. King does not give his authority. Dr. Murray (<i>N.E.D.</i>) says, "Of the derivation nothing is yet known." I do not find the above among the "guesses" alluded to by Dr. Murray.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_225"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_225">131:213</A> The value of medals whether to be worn as amulets, or used as talismans to procure objects desired, or to cure diseases, is by no means a notion confined <a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A> to the ancients. In Ireland "some five-and-forty years ago a temperance medal was found to be a specific for every ailment; not all medals, however, but only those which had been blessed and given by Father Mathew. Rubbing with one of these at once relieved rheumatic pains. I have seen ophthalmia treated by hanging two of these medals over a girl's eyes" (Le Fanu, <i>Seventy Years of Irish Life</i>, 1894, p. 114).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_226"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_226">132:214</A> Jahn, <i>Aberglauben</i>, etc., p. 98, says that "the dog as the beast of Hecate has to do with all magic" (<i>Zauberwesen</i>). In later times it was thought that by dogs' blood all evil witchery could be kept off.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_239"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_239">138:226</A> In consequence of the stress laid by Jahn upon the eye represented being the left, I have carefully examined all the eyes upon amulets which have come under my notice, and among a great number of examples I have found no marked preponderance either way, but on the whole should say there are more right eyes than left. The very common phrase "sinister expression," come to us from classic days, may have suggested to Jahn the idea that the left eye is especially malignant, but I can see no evidence in support of it, and believe the phrase has no connection with the evil eye, but that it springs from another and quite different set of beliefs.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_241">139:228</A> Striking examples of this act have not long since come under the notice of the writer, in one of which a man used this means of grossly insulting a woman--about his equal in refinement--with whom he had had a quarrel.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_242"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_242">139:229</A> This gesture was evidently of widespread use in ancient times. We are told that in the ceremony of going down the Nile to the festive worship of Bast at Bubastis the crowded boats, as they passed near a town, came close to <a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A> the bank. "Some of the women continue to sing and strike cymbals; others cry out as long as they can, and utter reproaches against the people of the town, who begin to dance, while the former pull up their clothes before them in a scoffing manner" (Herodotus, ii. 60, quoted by Budge, <i>Nile</i>, p. 111).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_243"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_243">140:230</A> The trident and sword are separate amulets, as shown later.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_244"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_244">140:231</A> This is taken from Jahn, p. 30, but according to Smith, <i>Dict. of Gr. and Rom. Antiq.</i>, the <i>galerus</i> was a helmet or head-dress.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_245"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_245">141:232</A> On the other hand, in the same volume (xix. of <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, at p. 99), the Rev. Stephen Weston contests this view, and tries to prove that the whole piece of sculpture is a representation of the sacred rites of Mythra; but his views in support of his Mythraic theory are speculative and fanciful in face of the materialistic story of the marble itself. Upon this point Jahn, p. 31, says: "Es kann kein Zweifel sein und ist von allen erkannt, dass es bestimmt war Schutz gegen den Zauber des b&ouml;sen Blicks zu gew&auml;hren."</P>

The fish here compounded with <i>l'&#156;il mystique</i>, and the no less mystical lotus, is undoubtedly the sacred Lepidotus, fully described by Wilkinson (vol. iii. pp. 340 <i>et seq</i>.). It surely is not unreasonable to consider that a form of decoration common to Egyptians, Etruscans, and Greeks was not a mere coincidence, but had a well-understood common significance. The original bowl is in the Berlin Museum. The same illustration is in Wilkinson, vol. ii. p. 42.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_256"></A><A HREF="tee06.htm#fr_256">145:243</A> It is certain that as works of art a vast number of the objects used as amulets were of a very debased kind indeed; but it should always be remembered that the virtue of an amulet or talisman lay in the type it embodied, and in its own material substance--the manner of execution of the potent sigil was altogether unconsidered. This will become abundantly plain when we come <a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A> to consider the very rough and crude objects made in these latter days for constant use in Naples-where the thing represented is of the rudest, coarsest work, while all the time it is of the most imperative necessity that each article should be of sterling silver, which must be attested by the hall-mark.</P>
