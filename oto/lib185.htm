                        Being the Tasks of the Grades,  
                               and their Oaths,  
                             proper to Liber XIII,

                            in Class D from A to G.



     This  paper  is  to  be returned to the  A.'.  A.'.  by  the  Neophyte 
    introducing through his Zelator.

                       A.'. A.'. Publication in Class D. 

                                       A.

                           THE TASK OF A PROBATIONER.

    0.  Let  any  person  be  received by  a  Neophyte,  the  latter  being 
    responsible to his Zelator.

    1. The period of Probation shall be at least one year.

    2. The aspirant to the A.'. A.'. shall hear the Lection (Liber LXI) and 
    this note of his office;  IF HE WILL,  shall then procure the robe of a 
    Probationer; shall choose with deep forethought and intense solemnity a 
    motto.

    3.  On reception, he shall receive the robe, sign the form provided and 
    repeat the oath appointed, and receive the First Volume of the Book.

    4.  He shall commit a chapter of Liber LXV to memory;  and furthermore, 
    he shall study the Publications of the A.'.  A.'. in Class B, and apply 
    himself to such practices of Scientific Illuminism as seemeth him good.

    5.  Beside all this,  he shall perform any tasks that the A.'. A.'. may 
    see fit to lay upon him.  Let him be mindful that the word  Probationer 
    is  no  idle  term,  but that the Brothers will in many  a  subtle  way 
    'prove' him, when he knoweth it not.

    6.  When  the  sun shall next enter the sign under which he  hath  been 
    received, his initiation may be granted unto him. He shall keep himself 
    free from all other engagements for one whole week from that date.

    7.  He  may  at any moment withdraw from his association with the  
    A.'. A.'., simply notifying the Neophyte who introduced him.

    8.  He  shall  everywhere  proclaim  openly  his  connection  with  the  
    A.'.  A.'.  and  speak of It and Its principles (even so little  as  he 
    understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.

    One month before the completion of his year, he shall deliver a copy of 
    the  Record of his year's work to the Neophyte introducing,  and repeat 
    to him his chosen chapter of Liber LXV.

    9. He shall hold himself chaste, and reverent toward his body, for that 
    the  ordeal  of  initiation  is no  light  one.  This  is  of  peculiar 
    importance in last two months of his Probation.

    10.  Thus and not otherwise may he attain the great reward: YEA, MAY HE 
    OBTAIN THE GREAT REWARD!

    0.   Let  any  Probationer  who  has  accomplished  his  task  to   the 
    satisfaction  of the A.'.  A.'.  be instructed in the proper course  of 
    procedure:  which is:  -- Let him read through this note of his office, 
    and  sign it,  paying the sum of One Guinea for Liber VII which will be 
    given him on his initiation, and One Guinea for this Portfolio of Class 
    D  publications,  B - G.  Let him obtain the robe of  a  Neophyte,  and 
    entrust the same to the care of his Neophyte.

    He  shall  choose  a  new  motto  with  deep  forethought  and  intense 
    solemnity,  as  expressing the clearer consciousness of his  Aspiration 
    which the year's Probation has given him.

    Let  him  make an appointment with his Neophyte at the pleasure of  the 
    the latter for the ceremony of Initiation.

    5.  Beside all this, he shall perform any tasks that his Zelator in the 
    name of the A.'. A.'. and by its authority may see fit to lay upon him. 
    Let him be mindful that the word Neophyte is no idle term,  but that in 
    many a subtle way the new nature will stir within him,  when he knoweth 
    it not.

    6.  When the sun shall next enter the sigh 240 (degrees) to that  under 
    which  he hath been received,  his advancement may be granted unto him.

    to him his chosen chapter of Liber VII.

    9.  He  shall in every way fortify his body according to the advice  of 
    his Zelator, for that the ordeal of advancement is no light one.

    0.  Let  any Neophyte who has accomplished his task to the satisfaction 
    of the A.'. A.'. be instructed in the proper course of procedure: which 
    is:--

    Let him read through this note of his office,  and sign it,  paying the 
    sum of Three Guineas for the volume containing Liber CCXX,  Liber XXVII 
    and Liber DCCCXIII, which will be given him on his initiation.

    shall  have attained complete success in the former,  i.e.,  the chosen 
    posture  shall be perfectly steady and easy;  and attained  the  second 
    stage in the latter, i.e., automatic rigidity.

    3.  He  shall  further  show some acquaintance with and  experience  of 
    meditations  given in Liber HHH.  And in this his Record shall  be  his 
    witness.

    Let  him be mindful that the word Zelator is no idle term,  but that  a 
    certain Zeal will be inflamed with him, why he knoweth not.

    6.  When  authority confers the grade,  he shall rejoice  therein;  but 
    beware,  for that that is his first departure from the middle pillar of 
    the Tree of Life.

    7.  He  may  at any moment withdraw from his association with the  A.'. 
    A.'. simply notifying the Practicus who introduced him.

    Yet  let  him remember that being entered thus far upon  the  Path,  he 
    cannot excape it,  and return to the world, but must ultimate either in 
    the City of the Pyramids or the lonely towers of the Abyss.

    8.  He  shall everywhere proclaim openly his connection with  the  A.'. 
    A.'.  and  speak  of  It  and  Its principles (even  so  little  as  he 
    understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.

    Furthermore,  he  shall construct the magic Dagger,  according  to  the 
    instruction in Liber A.

    This paper is to be returned to the Chancellor of the A.'. A.'. through 
    the Adeptus Minor admitting.

                                   A.'. A.'. 
                            Publication in Class D. 

                                      F.

                        THE TASK OF A DOMINUS LIMINIS.

    0. Let any Philosophus be appointed by authority a Dominus Liminis.

    Let him then read through this note of his office and sign it.

    Let  him  cause the necessary addition to be made to  his  Philosophus' 
    robe.

    Let him receive Liber Mysteriorum.

    Let him make an appointment with his Dominus Liminis at the pleasure of 
    the latter for the confering of advancement.

    1.  The  Dominus Liminis shall proceed to the Grade of Adeptus Minor at 
    any time that authority confers it.

    2. He shall pass examination in Liber III, Cap. III.

    3.  He  shall meditate on the diverse knowledge and Power that  he  has 
    acquired,  and  harmonize it perfectly.  And in this matter shall he be 
    judged by the Praemonstrator of the A.'. A.'.

    4.  He shall accept an office in a Temple of Initiation,  and commit to 
    memory a part appointed by the Imperator of the A.'. A.'.

    5. Besides all this, he shall abide upon the Threshold. Let him remember
    that the word Dominus Liminis is no idle term, but that his mastery
    will often be disputed, when he knoweth it not.

    6.  When  at last he hath attained the grade of Adeptus Minor,  let him 
    humble himself exceedingly.

    7.  He may at any moment withdraw from his association with the A.'. A.'. 
    simply notifying the Adept who introduced him.

    8.  He  shall  everywhere proclaim openly his connection with the  A.'. 
    A.'.  and  speak  of  It  and Its principles  (even  so  little  as  he 
    understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.

    Furthermore,   he   shall  construct  the  magic  Lamp,   according  to 
    instructions in Liber A.

    Six months after his admission to the Grade, he shall go to his Adeptus 
    Minor,  pass the necessary tests,  and repeat to him his appointed part 
    in the Temple of Initiation.

    9.  He  shall in every way establish perfect control of his  intuition, 
    according  to the advice of his Adeptus Minor,  for that the ordeal  of 
    advancement is no light one.

    10.  Thus and not otherwise may he obtain to the great reward: YEA, MAY 
    HE OBTAIN THE GREAT REWARD!
