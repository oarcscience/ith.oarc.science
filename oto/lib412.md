Let the Dominus Liminis take pure lead, tin, and quicksilver, with
platinum, and, if need be, glass.  
Let him by his understanding and ingenium devise a Magick Lamp that
shall burn without wick or oil, being fed by the Aethyr.  
This shall he accomplish secretly and apart, without asking the advice
or approval of his Adeptus Minor.  
Let the Dominus Liminis keep it when consecrated in the secret chamber
of Art.  
This then is that which is written: "Bring furnished with complete
armour and armed, he is similar to the goddess."  
And again, "I am armed, I am armed."
