# Manifesto of the O.T.O.

## Issued by Order:

## BAPHOMET XI° O.T.O., HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM, REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS

Peace, Tolerance, Truth;  
Salutation on All Points of the Triangle;  
Respect To the Order.

To All Whom It May Concern: Greeting and Health.

**Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.**

1\. The O.T.O. is a body of initiates in whose hands are concentrated
the wisdom and the knowledge of the following bodies:  

1.  The Gnostic Catholic Church.
2.  The Order of the Knights of the Holy Ghost.
3.  The Order of the Illuminati.
4.  The Order of the Temple (Knights Templar).
5.  The Order of the Knights of St. John.
6.  The Order of the Knights of Malta.
7.  The Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.
8.  The Hidden Church of the Holy Graal.
9.  The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light.
10. The Holy Order of Rose Croix of Heredom.
11. The Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch.
12. The Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry (33 degrees).
13. The Rite of Memphis (97 degrees).
14. The Rite of Mizraim (90 degrees).
15. The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry (33 degrees).
16. The Swedenborgian Rite of Masonry.
17. The Order of the Martinists.
18. The Order of the Sat Bhai, and many other orders of equal merit, if
    of less fame.

It does not include the A.·.A.·., with which august body it is, however,
in close alliance.

It does not in any way infringe the just privileges of duly authorized
Masonic Bodies.

2\. The dispersion of the original secret wisdom having led to
confusion, it was determined by the Chiefs of all these Orders to
recombine and centralize their activities, even as white light, divided
in a prism, may be recomposed.

It embodies the whole of the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders;
and its chiefs are initiates of the highest rank, and recognized as such
by all capable of such recognition in every country in the world.

In more remote times, the constituent originating assemblies of the
O.T.O. included such men as:

And recently:

<div align="center">

</div>

The names of women members are never divulged.

It is not lawful here to disclose the name of any living chief.

It was Karl Kellner who revived the exoteric organization of the O.T.O.
and initiated the plan now happily complete of bringing all occult
bodies again under one governance.

The letters O.T.O. represent the words Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of
the Temple of the Orient, or Oriental Templars), but they have also a
secret meaning for initiates.

3\. The Order is international, and has existing branches in every
civilized country of the world.

4\. The aims of the O.T.O. can only be understood fully by its highest
initiates; but it may be said openly that it teaches Hermetic Science or
Occult Knowledge, the Pure and Holy Magick of Light, the Secrets of
Mystic attainment, Yoga of all forms, Gnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakta Yoga
and Hatha Yoga, and all other branches of the secret Wisdom of the
Ancients.

In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries; its brain has resolved all the
problems of philosophy and of life.

It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of
Immortality, and of the Universal Medicine.

Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world-old dream
of the Brotherhood of Man.

It also possesses in every important centre of poÿulation a hidden
Retreat (*Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum*) where members may conceal
themselves in order to pursue the Great Work without hindrance.

These houses are secret fortresses of Truth, Light, Power and Love, and
their position is only disclosed under an oath of secrecy to those
entitled to make use of them.

They are also temples of true worship, specially consecrated by Nature
to bring out of a man all that is best in him.

5\. The authority of the O.T.O. is concentrated in the O.H.O. (Outer
Head of the Order), or Frater Superior. The name of the person occupying
this office is never disclosed except to his immediate representatives.

6\. The Authority of the O.H.O. in all English-speaking countries is
delegated by charter to the Most Holy, Most Illustrious, Most
Illuminated, and Most Puissant Baphomet X° Rex Summus Sanctissimus 33°,
90°, 96°, Past Grand Master of the United States of America, Grand
Master of Ireland, Iona, and All the Britains, Grand Master of the
Knights of the Holy Ghost, Sovereign Grand Commander of the Order of the
Temple, Most Wise Sovereign of the Order of the Rosy Cross, Grand
Zerubbabel of the Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch, etc. etc. etc.,
National Grand Master General *ad vitam* of the O.T.O.

7\. The National Grand Master General *ad vitam* is assisted by two
principal officers, the Grand Treasurer General and the Grand Secretary
General.

There are many other officers, but they do not concern those to whom the
present manifesto is addressed.

8\. The whole of the Knowledge dispersed among the bodies mentioned in
paragraph 2 has been sifted and concentrated in the following degrees.

9\. Every man and woman that is of full age, free, and of good report,
has an indefeasible right to the III°.

Beyond this, admission is only granted by invitation from the governing
body concerned.

The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body so far
as the 'secrets' are concerned in the sense in which that expression is
usually understood; and therefore in no way conflicts with, or infringes
the just privileges of, the United Grand Lodge of England, or any Grand
Lodge in America or elsewhere which is recognized by it.

10\. Application for admission to the Order may be made personally at
headquarters, between the hours of Ten A.M. and Twelve Noon on
week-days, or by letter to the Grand Secretary General. In the former
case, applicants should be provided with the Twenty Dollars entitling
them to the Third Degree; in the latter, it should be enclosed with the
application.

The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third Degree; if
this is taken after June 30 in any year, only half the amount is due.

Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but the Brother is
considered in good standing, and he does not lose his rights, if it is
paid by March 1. Should he fail to discharge his obligation by this
date, he ceases *ipso facto* to be a member of the Order, but may be
reinstated on paying arrears and Five Dollars extra. If his lapse extend
to the next year following, he can only be reinstated under special
conditions, and by the express consent in writing of the National Grand
Master General *ad vitam*.

11\. The Constitution, Trust Deeds, Charters, Warrants and all other
documents, are exhibited to candidates on their exaltation to the IV°,
should they desire it.

12\. Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas for
framing are granted to all members at a uniform price of Ten Dollars.
Special diplomas of the IX°, Twenty-five Dollars.

13\. The privileges of members of the O.T.O. are very numerous. These
are the principal:

1.  They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole body of
    hidden knowledge preserved in the Sanctuary from the beginning of
    its manifestation.

    In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted and conveyed in
    symbol, beneath veil, and through sacrament.

    In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so
    that he who well uses the knowledge of the lower grades may be
    selected for invitation to the higher, where all things are declared
    openly.

2.  They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in Liberty,
    Beauty, Harmony, and Love which flames within the heart of the
    O.T.O., and the Light of that august fraternity insensibly
    illuminates them ever more and more as they approach its central
    Sun.

3.  They meet those persons most complemental to their own natures, and
    find unexpected help and brotherhood in the whole world wherever
    they may travel.

4.  They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the O.T.O.,
    permanently or for a greater or lesser period of the year according
    to their rank in the Order; or, in the case of those of the Fifth
    and lower degrees, are candidates for invitation to these houses.

5.  The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine
    is restricted to members of the IX°; but it may be administered to
    members of the VIII° and VII° in special circumstances by favour of
    the National Grand Masters General, and even in particular emergency
    to members of lower degrees.

6.  In the V° all members are pledged to bring immediate and perfect
    relief to all distress of mind, body, or estate, in which they may
    find any of their fellows of that degree. In the higher degrees the
    Bonds of Fraternity are still further strengthened. The Order thus
    affords a perfect system of insurance against every misfortune or
    accident of life.

7.  Members of the IX° become part proprietors of the Estates and Goods
    of the Order, so that the attainment of this degree implies a return
    with interest of the fees and subscriptions paid.

8.  The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy members of
    even its lower degrees, so that, even if originally poor, they
    become well able to afford the comparatively high fees of the VII°,
    VIII°, and IX°. On exaltation to the IV° each Companion may file an
    account of his circumstances, and state in what direction he
    requires help.

14\. In selecting members for advancement, attention is paid to their
devotion to the Order, to their intelligence in apprehending the nature
of its teaching, to their zeal in spreading the principles of the Order
so far as they themselves understand them, though always with the
discretion inseparable from the due guarding of the secrets, and to all
those qualities of courage, honour, and virtue without which man is not
worthy of that name.

15\. The O.H.O. is only known to members of the VIII° and IX°.

The National Grand Master General ad vitam is not approachable as such
by any person who has not reached the VI°.

All communications should be addressed to the Grand Secretary General,
and all cheques drawn in favour of the Grand Treasurer General.

**Issued by Order,**

**L. Bathurst IX°, Grand Secretary General**
