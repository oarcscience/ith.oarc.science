<h3 class="heading" align="center">PREFATORY NOTE</h3>
<p>The following Essay is one of the most remarkable studies in the Hebrew Qabalah 
  known to me.</p>
<p>Its venerable author was an adept familiar with many systems of symbolism, 
  and able to harmonise them for himself, even as now is accomplished for all 
  men in the Book &quot;777&quot;.</p>
<p>In the year 1899 he was graciously pleased to receive me as his pupil, and, 
  living in his house, I studied daily under his guidance the Holy Qabalah. Upon 
  his withdrawal --- whether to enjoy his Earned Reward, or to perform the Work 
  of the Brotherhood in other lands or planets matters nothing here --- he bequeathed 
  to me a beautiful Garden, the like of which hath rarely been seen upon Earth.</p>
<p>It has been my pious duty to collate and comment upon this arcane knowledge, 
  long treasured in my heart, watered alike by my tears and my blood, and sunned 
  by that all-glorious Ray that multiplieth itself into an Orb ineffable.</p>
<p>In this Garden no flower was fairer than this exquisite discourse; I beg my 
  readers to pluck it and lay it in their hearts.</p>
<p>It should be studied in connection with the Book &quot;777,&quot; and with 
  the Sepher Sephiroth, a magical dictionary of pure {165} number which was begun 
  by the author of this essay, carried on by myself, and now about to be published 
  as soon as the MS. can be prepared.</p>
<p>The reader who is at all familiar with the sublime computations of the Qabalah 
  will find no difficulty in appreciating this Essay to the full; but all will 
  gain benefit from the study of the ratiocinative methods employed. These methods, 
  indeed, are so fine and subtile that they readily sublime into the Intuitive. 
  This study is truly a Royal Magistry, an easy and sure means of exalting the 
  consciousness from Ruach to Neschamah.</p>
<p>{166}</p>
<H3 align="center" class="heading">PART I</h3>
<p>IN the First Verse of the First Chapter of the First Five Books of the Holy 
  Law: it is written: --- B'RAShITh Ba RA ALoHIM ATh HaShaMaIM VaATH HaAReTz, 
  or in Aramaic script</p>
<p>Bet-Resh-Aleph-Shin-Yod-Taw Bet-Resh-Aleph Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal Aleph-Taw 
  Heh-Shin-Mem-Yod-Memfinal Vau-Aleph-Taw Heh-Aleph-Resh-Tzaddifinal</p>
<p>Such are the Seven Words which constitute the Beginnings or Heads of One Law; 
  and I propose to show, by applying to the Text the Keys of the Qabalah, that 
  not merely the surface meaning is contained therein.</p>
<p>In the Beginning, created, God, the Essence of the Heavens, and the Essence, 
  of the Earth. </p>

<p>Contained therein also are the Divine, Magical, and Terrestrial Formulae of 
  the Passage of the Incomprehensible Nothingness of the Ain Soph to the Perfection 
  of Creation {167} expressed by the Ten Voices or Emanations of God the Vast 
  One --- Blessed be He! --- even the Holy Sephiroth.</p>
<p>And the Method whereby I shall work shall be the One Absolute and inerratic 
  Science: the Science of Number: which is that single Mystery of the Intellect 
  of Man whereby he becometh exalted unto the Throne of Inflexible and Unerring 
  Godhead.</p>
<p>As it is written, &quot;Oh, how the World hath Inflexible Intellectual Rulers&quot; 
  (Zoroaster).</p>
<p>But before I may proceed unto the Qabalistical*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*Here use in its true meaning of &quot;the marshalling forth 
    by number.&quot; Qabalah, Qof-Bet-Lamed-Heh, by Tarot, &quot;The Mystery shown 
    forth in balanced disposition by Command.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>enumeration and analysis of the Text, a certain preamble in the fruitful fields 
  of that Science will become necessary. The Evolution of the Numbers is the Evolution 
  of the Worlds, for as it is written in the Clavicula Salomonis, &quot;The Numbers 
  are Ideas; and the Ideas are the Powers, and the Powers are the Holy Elohim 
  of Life.&quot; That which is behind and beyond all Number and all thought (even 
  as the Ain Soph with its Mighty Veils depending back from Kether is behind and 
  beyond all Manifestation) is the Number 0. Its symbol is the very Emblem of 
  Infinite Space and Infinite Time.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*&quot;Hidden behind my Magic Veil of Shows, I am not seen 
    at all --- Name not my Name.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multiply by it any active and manifested number; and that number vanishes --- 
  sinks into the Ocean of Eternity. So also is the Ain Soph. From it proceed all 
  Things: unto It all will return, when the Age of Brahman is over and done, and 
  the day of Peace-Be-with-Us is declared by Thoth, {168} the Great God, and the 
  Material Universe sinketh into Infinity.</p>
<p>The first Number, then is ONE; emblem of the All-Father; the Unmanifest Mind 
  behind all Manifestation: the First Mind. Multiply by It any other Number --- 
  for the Multiplication of the Numbers is a Generation, as is the Multiplication 
  of Men and Gods --- and behold! the <em>Resultant</em> is a replica of the Number 
  taken. So is One the All-Father, the All-begetter --- generating and producing 
  all.</p>
<p>The next step is the division into TWO. Thus was manifested the Great Dual 
  Power of Nature. As above, so below. And thus we find that the simple division 
  into two is the method of multiplication of the Amoeba, the lowest, simplest, 
  and most absolute form of physical life that we know.</p>
<p>The Dual Power of Nature is the Great Mother of the Worlds.</p>
<p>Again, to draw an analogy from the Material World, consider the Moon, our Mother. 
  Behold in her the Typic representative of the Powers of the Two. Light and Darkness, 
  Flux and Reflux, Ebb and Flow --- these are her manifested Powers in Nature 
  --- where also she binds the <em>Great Waters</em> to her Will.</p>
<p>Now in the Yetziratic Attribution is the second number, Beth (<em>i.e.</em>, 
  a House), an Abode, the Dwelling of the Holy One, shown to be equivalent to 
  the Sphere of Kokab and his lords. And the symbolic weapon of Mercury is the 
  Caduceus, whose Twin Serpents show again the Dualistic Power. (<em>Note</em>. 
  --- Woden, the Scandinavian Mercury, was the All-Father, as it is written in 
  the Ritual of the Path of the Spirit of the Primal {169} Fire HB:Shin. &quot;For 
  all things did the Father of All Things perfect, and delivered them over unto 
  the <em>Second Mind; whom all Races of Men call 'First</em>.&quot;) Behold, 
  then, in these two great Numbers 1 and 2 the Father and the Mother of the Worlds 
  and of Numbers.</p>
<p>Now these twain being Conjoined and manifest in ONE, produce the Number 3; 
  as it is written: &quot;For the Mind of the Father said that 'All Things should 
  be cut into Three,' Whose Will*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*HB:Bet, the magus of Power in Taro = Will.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>assenting All Things were so divided. For the Mind of the Father said <em>Into 
  three</em>, governing All Things by Mind. And there appeared in it the Triad, 
  Virtue and Wisdom and Multiscient Truth.&quot; Thus floweth forth the form of 
  the Triad.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*Ritual of the Path of the Daughter of the Firmament.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus is formulated the Creative Trinity which is, as it were, the essential 
  preliminary to Manifestation.</p>
<p>This Mystic Son of the Eternal Parents, having for his number 3, is typified 
  in all the sacred scripts by that number. Thus it is written of the manifestation 
  of the Son of God upon the Earth, &quot;Shiloh shall come&quot; (the initial 
  of which Mystery-Name is HB:Shin = 300). And in the Grecian tongue it is written: 
  &quot;In the beginning was the <em>Word</em>,&quot; &amp;c., which is lambda 
  omicron gamma omicron sigma (lambda = 30). But the best of all the Examples 
  is found in the Holy Tetragram Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh. For we may regard this venerable 
  name as typical of the Father and the Mother, and so divided into Vau-Heh and 
  Yod-Heh.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*&lt;&amp;ltFor it is written (Genesis v. 1, 2):</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">:Bet-Resh-Aleph Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal Aleph-DaletMemfinal 
    Bet-Dalet-Mem-Vau-Taw Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal Ayin-Shin-Heh Aleph-Taw-Vau 
    Qof-Bet-Resh Vau-Nun-Qof-Bet-Heh Bet-Resh-Aleph-Memfinal</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&quot;And the Elohim created Mankind: in the Likeness of the 
    Elohim created they them: Male and Female created they them.&quot; Now if 
    ADAM be in the similitude of the Elohim: and are male and female, then must 
    the Elohim be also male and female. Now in the first of those mysterious three 
    verses in Exodus xiv. wherein the divided name is hidden it is written, &quot;and 
    went the Angel of the Elohim before the Camp,&quot; &amp;c. And this Angel 
    of the Elohim, Mem-Lamed-Aleph-Kophfinal Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal, is 
    the Manifestations of their presence. Now Mem-Lamed-Aleph-Kophfinal hath the 
    numeration 91, which also is the number of Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh Aleph-Dalet-Nun-Yod, 
    wherefore by Gematria &quot;Tetragrammaton our Lord&quot; is the Angel Now 
    if into the midst of this divided Name of the Elohim of the Divided Name. 
    Therefore is the Tetragrammaton symbolic of the Manifested Presence of the 
    Elohim; and if the Elohim be Male and Female, so also must be the Tetragram. 
    Also is the number of Aleph-Mem-Nunfinal (also 91) by Aiq Bekar 1 + 4 + 5 
    = 10 --- the Perfection of the Sephiroth.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>{170} we cast the triple fire of the Holy letter HB:Shin = 300, we get the 
  name of the Godhead Incarnate upon Earth, Yod-Heh-Shin-Vau-Heh. But 1 + 2 + 
  3 = 6, which is the number of HB:Vau, the third letter of the Venerable Name: 
  Microprosopus and the Son of God.</p>
<p>We are now, therefore, arrived at the Great Mystery of the Tetractys, and to 
  go further we must resort to the Twin Sister of the Science of Number --- which, 
  indeed, is but Number made Flesh: Geometry, or Absolute Symbolism. Even as it 
  was spoken by the holy Pythagoras: &quot;God geometrises.&quot;</p>

<p>In both of these Symbols the all-including circle represents the underlying 
  idea of the Number 0: the Infinite: Parabrahman: the Ain Soph. In the first 
  is shown the Mystic Trinity before manifestation; as it were unlimited, unbound, 
  and unbounded, inoperative because of its diffusiveness and dispersion. In the 
  second figure we behold their concentration: focalisation: producing by their 
  joint action the number of manifestation --- 4. In the worlds --- Assiah: in 
  the Taro, the Princess --- the throne of the Spirit: in the Tetragram, the He 
  final, and in symbolic language --- the Daughter: in the Cycle of Life (Birth, 
  Life, Death, Resurrection), the forth; in the Keys of the Book Universal, the 
  Empress, Kappa-omicron-rho-eta Kappa-omicron-sigma-mu-omicron-upsilon, the Virgin 
  of the World, Venus, Aphrodite: Centrum in Trigonis Centri --- by whatsoever 
  of a myriad names we call Her, still the same in Spirit, the same in Number 
  and in form! And this number is herein formulated by the Concentration of the 
  Three in One. 3 + 1 = 4. Now in this Figure II. we behold six certain Paths; 
  and in six days did {172} God create the Heavens and the Earth. And the total 
  numeration of its numbers is the Perfect Number, even the Decade of the Sephiroth. 
  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.)</p>

    alone amongst the Shells is Nogah, the Sphere of Venus, exalted unto Holiness.

<p>of Venus, HB:Dalet, is the Gateway of Initiation: that one planet whose symbol 
  alone embraceth the 10 Sephiroth; the Entrance to the Shrine of our Father C.R.C., 
  the Tomb of Osiris; the God Revealer, coming, moreover, by the Central Path 
  of HB:Samekh through the midst of the Triangle of Light. And the Lock which 
  guards that Door is as the Four Gates of the Universe. And the Key is The Ankh, 
  Immortal Life --- the Rose and Cross of Life; and the Symbol of Venus Venus.</p>

  DEI: which is also the AGNUS DEI, or Lamb of God that destroyeth (literally 
  <em>burns out</em>) the Sins of the World. As it is written in the Ordinary 
  of the Mass: the Priest goeth unto the South of the Altar and prays: &quot;O 
  Agnus Dei! qui tollis -- qui tollis Peccata Mundi --- Dona Nobis Pacem!&quot; 
  And this Fire, this Lamb of God, is <em>Aries</em>, Symbol of the Dawning Year: 
  whose colour also is as the Red Fire, and which is the head of the Fiery Triplicity 
  in the Zodiac. So also in the Grade of Neophyte in the Order of the Golden Dawn 
  the Hierophant weareth a robe of flame-scarlet as symbolic of the Dawn.</p>
<p>NOTE. --- It may be objected to this enunciation of the colours that HB:Yod, 
  the Father, is Fire; that HB:Heh, the Mother, is Water; that HB:Vau, the Son, 
  is Air, and Yellow instead of Red. This also is true, but it relates to the 
  governance of the Elemental Kingdoms, which are in the Astral Worlds, and whose 
  monads are on the descending arc of Life, whilst Man is on the Ascending; that 
  scale is therefore inverted. For by the mighty sacrifice of the Man Made Flesh 
  and by His Torturous Pilgrimage is evolved that Glorified Son Who is Greater 
  than His Father. In Alchemy we have again the descending arc, for we find that 
  the <em>red</em> powder cast upon the Water of the Metals produceth the Golden 
  Sol. But it is important not to confuse. The Christians have terribly muddled 
  their Trinity by making the Son the second instead of the third Principle; whilst 
  with them the Holy Spirit at one Time symbolizes the Mother and at another the 
  Son.</p>
<p>Thus at the Annunciation and at the Baptism of the Christ the S.S. appeareth 
  as a Dove, emblem of Venus and the Mother: whilst the S.S. that descended upon 
  the Apostles at {175} Pentecost was in reality the Spirit of the Christ, and 
  therefore symbolised by the HB:Shin (<em>see</em> Lecture on Microcosmos in 
  MSS. of R.R. et A.C.).</p>
<pre>   In Theosophical nomenclature this latter was the M anas or Jeheshuah:
the third Principle.                               / \
                                                  A---U

   For the same reason I have drawn the triangle with the 3 uppermost
  3  instead of  3---2
 / \              \ /  .
1---2              1</pre>

<h3 class="heading" align="center">PART II</h3>
<p>IT was necessary that I should go thus somewhat at length into this Mystery 
  of the Opening of the Numbers, because without this explanation much of the 
  meaning of the verse must necessarily remain obscure.</p>
<p>Now let us consider this most Mystic Verse!</p>
<p>The first thing that strikes us is that it contains <em>Seven Words:</em> the 
  Second that the number of its letters is &quot;twenty-eight.&quot; Thus does 
  it perfectly symbolise in its entirety the third Symbol in the numerical evolution.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to a detailed analysis, and following the Process of Creation 
  by Time (<em>i.e</em>., beginning at the first letter, and so proceeding), let 
  me point out a few general facts. First as to the number of letters in each 
  word, which converted into figures stands thus: 4.3.5.2.5.3.6. (Hebrew direction).</p>
<p>In the midst is 2, by Taro the Central Will: and this two-lettered word is 
  Aleph-Taw. On either side of this is the pair of figures 35- 53, balanced one 
  against the other: as though symbolic of the great dawning of life of the <em>Mothers</em> 
  --- HB:Heh and HB:Heh, vitalised by the SON (3) as the Vice-Gerent of His Father.</p>
<p>These balanced figures together make 16, whereof the Key is 7; the total number 
  of letters in the third Symbol. Then we have left at either end 4 and 6 = 10,*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">* <em>Vide</em> Sepher Yetzirah for this division of the Holy 
    Sephiroth into a Hexad and a Tetrad.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the perfection of the {177} Sephiroth, as if to declare that this verse from, 
  beginning to end thereof reflected the Voices from Kether even unto Malkuth: 
  and 6 - 4 = 2 again, the Central Will, HB:Bet, Thoth, in the Heart of the Universe 
  (as in the centre of the verse). Note, then, this perfect equilibrium of the 
  verse, and remember that Mystery --- that equilibrium is strength.</p>
<p>Let us now look at the letters themselves. Counting them, we find that the 
  two central ones are Mem-Aleph, the Supernal Mother; even as the number of letters 
  had the dual symbol in their midst. Now their numeration is 41, yielding by 
  Gematria Aleph-Yod-Lamed = Force: Might: Power: Gemel-Aleph-Vau-Aleph-Lamed, 
  Divine Majesty: and Aleph-Chet-Lamed-Bet = Fecundity, all symbolic of the attributes 
  of the Dual Polar Force and Mother. Moreover, 4 + 1 = 5 = HB:Heh, Mother Supernal 
  once again --- and in its geometric symbol the Pentagram --- the Star of Unconquered 
  Will. Add the next two letters on either side,</p>
<p>Yod-Memfinal-Aleph-Taw </p>
<p>and we get Earth-Air-Water-Fire, or a concealed Tetragrammaton.</p>
<p>And this also reads Yod-Memfinal, the Great Sea, Aleph-Taw, Alpha and Omega, 
  or Essence. Add the next two, so that the six central letters are obtained; 
  and we read Heh-Yod-Memfinal-Aleph-Taw-Heh, which signifies Heh-Yod-Memfinal, 
  swollen, extended, or expanded; and hence <em>Thou</em> (<em>i.e</em>., God, 
  Ateh, the All) <em>in extension</em>. But by Metathesis of these six letters 
  is obtained Heh-Yod-Heh Aleph-Mem-Taw = &quot;Truth Was,&quot; as if affirming 
  solemnly the presence in the Creation of the Supernal Truth.</p>
<p>Now let us take the first and last letters of the verse and &quot;cast into 
  the midst thereof the Fire of the Sun&quot; --- <em>i.e.</em>, HB:Vau (6), &quot;the 
  Seal of Creation&quot; --- and we have Bet-Vau-Tzaddifinal, an Egg. Where we 
  see the whole universe enclosed in the Cosmic Egg of Hindu and Egyptian Mythology: 
  and the Formulation of the Sphere {178} of the Universe (or Magical Mirror in 
  Man). As it were the Egg of the Black Swan of Time, the Kala Hamsa, the Triune 
  M A U, or word of Power or of Seb, the Bird of Life, whose will was heard in 
  the Night of Time.</p>
<p>The total numeric value of the verse is Dalet-Taw-Nun-Tet = 4459, of which 
  the Key is 22, the number of the Paths from HB:Aleph to HB:Taw ; and the Key 
  of 22 is 4, the Tetractys and the Threshold of the Universe.</p>
<p>Now to proceed to what I have termed the Time Process, the first Word of the 
  Law then is Bet-Resh-Aleph-Shin-Yod-Taw. Now in the Hebrew Scriptures the first 
  word of a Book is also its Title. Thus Genesis is called by the Rabbins &quot;B'rasheth,&quot; 
  or &quot;In the Beginning,&quot; wherefore we may regard this Word as not the 
  first word --- albeit that is shadowed forth therein --- but as the seal and 
  title and Key of the whole book. Holding this in mind, let us proceed to analyse 
  it. The number of its letters is six, the Seal of Creation, and their total 
  numeric value is 2911. 2911 = 13 = Death, the Transformer*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*As it is written: &quot;Thy youth shall be renewed as the 
    Eagle's.&quot; Now the Eagle is HB:Nun. For further consideration of this 
    13, &quot;vide&quot; in the Portal Ritual the explanation of that terrible 
    Key. &quot;See&quot; account of this ritual in &quot;The Temple.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Also, 13 is the numeration of Aleph-Chet-Dalet = Unity, as 
    also is the Great Name of God, Aleph-Lamed, by Aiq Bekar or Temurah.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- the distinct formulation of the Three in One, uniting once more to produce 
  the 4.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Now Beth primarily signifieth a House or Abode, and in Taro it is Mercury, 
    the Magus --- the Vox Dei --- and Thoth, the Recorder. Coalesce these two 
    ideas and we get HB:Bet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the Magical History</em>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>HB:Resh signifieth the Head or Beginning of Time and {179} Things; and by 
    Taro it is glory, Life, Light, Sun. Thus read:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Of the Dawning of Life and Light.</em></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>HB:Aleph is by shape the Svastika, symbolically Aleph, the Ox, as though 
    showing the fearful force of the Spiritual &quot;Whirling Motions&quot; upon 
    the Material Plane, as a terrible and destructive Power. This is also shown 
    by the Foolish Man, as the Material Tarotic emblem of that which in its proper 
    and higher manifestation is the Spiritual Ether. Therefore we read:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Begun are the Whirling Motions</em>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>HB:Shin signifieth mighty in flame, whereof it is also the Hieroglyph. It 
    is that Ruach Elohim brooding upon the Face of the Waters. So read:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Formulated is the Primal Fire</em>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>HB:Yod is the Hand,*</p>
  <p><font size="2">*The Hand of God, always the Symbol of His Power.</font></p>
  <p>symbolising Power in Action, and its Taro Key is the Hermit and the Voice 
    of Light, the Prophet of the Gods. Thus:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proclaimed is the Reign of the Gods of Light</em>.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>HB:Taw is the last letter of the Alphabet, the <em>finis</em>, the Omega, 
    the Universe, Saturn, the outermost Planet, and it is also Taw-Resh-Ayin-Aleph, 
    Throa, the Gate of the Universe; and by Qabalah of nine Chambers it is HB:Dalet, 
    the Gateway of Initiation. Hence</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The positions of the last two letters of the Word have been relatively changed, 
  so as to render the meaning more harmoniously. {181}</p>
<p>We will now proceed to the first word of the text as thus decapitated, taking 
  B'rasheth as the Title rather than as the first Word. This latter stands Bet-Resh-Aleph, 
  which hath three Letters, symbolising thereby the Unmanifest Trinity.</p>
<p>Now its letters further exemplify the Trinity, for that they are the initials 
  of three Hebrew words, which are the Names of the Persons thereof, viz:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Bet-Nunfinal Ben, the Son.<br>
    Resh-Vau-Chet Ruach, the Spirit (here the Mother).<br>
    Aleph-Bet Ab, the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how here again the Son is first for Humanity and the Father last. These 
  three letters, then, symbolise the three in One Unmanifest. Yet is there in 
  them the All-potency of Life. For 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, the Symbol of Power, Mother 
  Supernal, and HB:Heh also is Aries, Lamb of God and Dawn of the Life of the 
  Year.</p>
<p>Wherefore in them lieth concealed and hidden, not alone the Divine White Brilliance 
  of the Three Supernals (Heh-Vau-Aleph, Vau-Qof-Dalet-Vau-Shin, Bet-Resh-Vau-Kophfinal), 
  but even also that Gleaming Glory which partaketh of the Redness, and which 
  cometh from the Bornless Age, which is beyond Kether. As it is written in Ancient 
  Hindu Scripture, &quot;In the beginning Desire, TANHA, arose in It: which was 
  the Primal Germ of Mind.&quot; Now in the Aryan Mythology Tanha, Desire, was 
  the God of Love, Kama; whereof the symbolic tint was Pink: as it were the first 
  pink blush of Dawn in the Macrocosmic Sky: Herald of the Rising Sun of the Worlds, 
  when the Great Night of Brahma was over and done.</p>
<p>The next word in the Great Name of God the Vast One: Aleph-Lamed-Heh-Yod-Memfinal. 
  Let us meditate upon its Mystery! Herein behold {182} five Letters: In its Centre 
  is the Great Letter HB:Heh, Mother Supernal. Five once more; and its first and 
  last letters are once again Aleph-Memfinal, 41, the Mother, and 5, the Maternal 
  Essence. And its numeration is 86, whereof the Key is 14, whereof the Key is 
  5. Wherefore we say that this great name is 5 in its form symbolic. 5 in the 
  Heart of its Power: the Beginning and the End thereof are 5; and 5 is it in 
  its Venerable Essence!</p>
<p>Turn now back unto the third Symbol; gaze at it steadily for a few moments, 
  and see hidden in the Six-fold Seal of Creation the Five-fold Star of Unconquered 
  Will.</p>
<p>For this was the Divine Force which created the worlds! Power Eternal, Power 
  Resistless, Power All-dominating, in its Absolute Supremacy --- gleaming as 
  the Great Name Elohim in the Heart of the Six- fold star! Flaming as the Purifying 
  Fire, purging and ordering the Chaos of the Night of Time!</p>
<p>As in the midst of the Letters of the Verse we saw the words Aleph-Taw-Heh 
  -Heh Yod-Memfinal, &quot;Thou in Extension,&quot; so also does the Name Elohim 
  read Aleph-Lamed, &quot;Deity,&quot; Heh-Yod-Memfinal, in Extension.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*And Aleph-Lamed = Lamed-Aleph, No, the Negative.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the numeration of Elohim is 86, which by Gematria reads Peh-Aleph-Heh, 
  again meaning &quot;spread out, extended.&quot;</p>
<p>Write the letters of this Name in any Invoking Pentagram; and the Banishing 
  Pentagram thereof will read 3.1415 (by Qabalah of nine Chambers), which is the 
  Formula of the Proportion of diameter to circumference of the Circle.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*The nearest computation to four places of decimals is 3.1416 
    (3.14156 {SIC. s.b. 3.1415926... --- WEH}). But 3.1415 is good enough for 
    the benighted Hebrews. --- P.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">In the sublime Computations of the Qabalah the Final Forms 
    of letters have no increased numerical value. Mem is 40, whether final or 
    not. The Ancient Hebrew Method of obtaining all numbers above 400 and below 
    1000, respectively HB:Aleph and HB:Taw {SIC s.b. HB:Taw and HB:Aleph --- WEH}, 
    was to make up the number with the proper letters. Thus 500 would have been 
    written Taw-Qof, not HB:Kophfinal, and 800 Taw-Taw, and so on. [Yet in some 
    few Arcana the Finals are counted as such. This mystery, however, pertaineth 
    to a Grade even more exalted than our beloved and erudite Brother had attained 
    at the period of this Essay {WEH paraphrase: Bennett didn't know, and Crowley 
    either doesn't know or won't say.}. --- P.]</font></p>

  Sphere to the Confines of Space! {183}</p>

<p>The next word is Aleph-Taw, which we have seen to be the Central word: and 
  its signification is the Alpha and Omega --- From Beginning unto End: Essence: 
  and its Key is 5.</p>
<p>Five again are the letters of the word Heh-Shin-Mem-Yod-Memfinal,*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*Whose Key number is 17: by Taro---Hope; whose title is Daughter 
    of the Firmament, dweller between the Waters.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which next follows; and in this word Shin-Mem-Yod-Memfinal, the Heavens, we 
  perceive HB:Shin*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*The initial HB:Heh is but the article &quot;the.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Ruach Elohim, brooding upon the Face of the Waters, Mem-Yod-Memfinal (Maim), 
  even as it is afterwards set forth in Verse 2.</p>
<p>In the next word, Vau-Aleph-Taw, we find that the Conjunctive HB:Vau makes 
  of the Key number of the Essence of the Earth 11 instead of 5: symbolising how 
  the World should fall unto the Kingdom of the Shells, and how it should be redeemed 
  by the Son of Man.*</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2">*For 11 is the Number of the Qliphoth; but when the Fall had 
    occurred and the Sephira Malkuth had been cut off from the Tree by the folds 
    of the Dragon there was added unto the Tree Dalet-Ayin-Taw, the Knowledge, 
    as the 11th Sephira, to preserve intact the &quot;Ten&quot;-ness of the Sephiroth. 
    Showing how by that very eating of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good 
    and of Evil should come the Saving of Mankind; for Daath is the Priceless 
    Gift of Knowledge and Intellect whereby cometh Salvation. Wherefore also is 
    11 the Key Number of the Great Saviour's Name (Yod-Heh-Shin-Vau-Heh = 29 = 
    11), and this is also in the Taro the Wheel of the Great Law, HB:Koph, the 
    Lord of the Forces of Life.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>{184}</p>
<p>And finally the word Heh-Aleph-Resh-Tzaddifinal, Ha Aretz, the Earth, hath 
  four Letters showing its Elemental Constitution, and its Key is 17 --- also 
  Hope --- Hope in the Earth as there is Hope in Heaven. And the last letter of 
  the verse is HB:Tzaddifinal (the letter of Hope), by Qabalah of Nine Chambers 
  that number which contains in itself all the properties of Protean Matters: 
  howsoever you may multiply it the Key of its Numbers is ever 9. Fitting Symbol 
  of ever-changing matter which ever in its essence is One --- one and alone!</p>
<p>Thus with the first appearance of the number of Matter does the first verse 
  of B'rasheth close: formulating in itself the Beginning and the End of the Great 
  Creation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Characters of Heaven with Thy Finger hast thou traced: But none can 
  read them save he hath been taught in Thy School.&quot;</p>
