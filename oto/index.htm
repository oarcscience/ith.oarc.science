These are texts relating to the 
philosophy of Thelema, many of them written by
the occultist Aleister Crowley 
who founded the organization A.'. A.'.
(Argentium Astrum -- the Silver Star)
as well as others by members of the OTO
(Ordo Templi Orientis -- Order of the Eastern Temple)
(founded by Theodor Reuss and Karl Kellner in 1895).
These two organizations work together to promote Thelema.
