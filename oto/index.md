| **Thelema Texts** |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are texts relating to the philosophy of Thelema, many of them
written by the occultist Aleister Crowley who founded the organization
A.'. A.'. (Argentium Astrum -- the Silver Star) as well as others by
members of the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis -- Order of the Eastern Temple)
(founded by Theodor Reuss and Karl Kellner in 1895). These two
organizations work together to promote Thelema.

The 'Class' is a OTO-assigned indication of the relative importance of
the document. Some of the texts listed here are not available in
electronic form for one reason or another; their descriptions have been
left in the table for completeness.
