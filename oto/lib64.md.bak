0\. The Temple being in darkness, and the Speaker ascended into his
place let him begin by a ritual of the Enterer, as followeth.

1.  HB:Vau Priocul, O procul este profani.
2.  Bahlasti! Ompehda!
3.  In the name of the Mighty and Terrible One, I proclaim that I have
    banished the Shells unto their habitations.
4.  I invoke Tahuti, the Lord of Wisdom and of Utterance, the God that
    cometh forth from the Veil.
5.  O Thou! Majesty of Godhead! Wisdom-crowned Tahuti! Lord of the Gates
    of the Universe! Thee, Thee, I invoke.  
    O Thou of the Ibis Head! Thee, Thee I invoke.  
    Thou who wieldest the Wand of Double Power! Thee, Thee I invoke!  
    Thou who bearest in Thy left hand the Rose and Cross of Light and
    Life: Thee, Thee, I invoke.  
    Thou, whose head is as an emerald, and Thy nemmes as the night-sky
    blue! Thee, Thee I invoke.  
    Thou, whose skin is of flaming orange as though it burned in a
    furnace! Thee, Thee I invoke.
6.  Behold! I am Yesterday, To-Day, and the Brother of To-Morrow!  
    I am born again and and again.  
    Mine is the Unseen Force, whereof the Gods are sprung! Which is as
    Life unto the Dwellers in the Watch-Towers of the Universe.  
    I am the Charioteer of the East, Lord of the Past and of the
    Future.  
    I see by mine own inward light: Lord of Resurrection; Who cometh
    forth from the Dusk, and my birth is from the House of Death.
7.  O ye two Divine Hawks upon your Pinnacles!  
    Who keep watch over the Universe!  
    Ye who company the Bier to the House of Rest!  
    Who pilot the Ship of Ra advancing onwards to the heights of
    heaven!  
    Lord of the Shrine which standeth in the Centre of the Earth!
8.  Behold, He is in me, and I in Him!  
    Mine is the Radiance, wherein Ptah floatheth over the firmament!  
    I travel upon high!  
    I tread upon the firmament of Nu!  
    I raise a flashing flame, with the lightning of Mine Eye!  
    Ever rushing on, in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra: giving
    my life to the Dwellers of Earth.
9.  If I say "Come up upon the mountains!" the Celestial Waters shall
    flow at my Word.  
    For I am Ra incarnate!  
    Kephra created in the Flesh!  
    I am the Eidolon of my father Tmu, Lord of the City of the Sun!
10. The God who commands is in my mouth!  
    The God of Wisdom is in my Heart!  
    My tongue is the Sanctuary of Truth!  
    And a God sitteth upon my lips.
11. My Word is accomplished every day!  
    And the desire of my heart realises itself, as that of Ptah when He
    createth!  
    I am Eternal; therefore all things are as my designs; therefore do
    all things obey my Word.
12. Therefore do Thou come forth unto me from Thine abode in the
    Silence: Unutterable Wisdom! All-Light! All-Power!  
    Thoth! Hermes! Mercury! Odin!  
    By whatever name I call Thee, Thou art still nameless to Eternity:.
    Come Thou forth, I say, and aid and guard me in this work of Art.
13. Thou, Star of the East, that didst conduct the Magi!  
    Thou art The Same all-present in Heaven and in Hell!  
    Thou that vibratest between the Light and the Darkness!  
    Rising, descending! Changing ever, yet ever The Same!  
    The Sun is Thy Father!  
    Thy Mother is the Moon!  
    The Wind hath borne Thee in its bosom: and Earth hath ever nourished
    the changeless Godhead of Thy Youth!
14. Come Thou forth, I say, come Thou forth!  
    And make all Spirits subject unto Me:  
    So that every Spirit of the Firmament  
    And of the Ether.  
    And of the Earth.  
    And under the Earth.  
    On dry land  
    And in the Water.  
    Of whirling Air  
    And of rushing Fire.  
    And every Spell and Scourge of God the Vast One, may be obedient
    unto Me!
15. I invoke the priestess of the Silver Star, Asi the Curved One, by
    the ritual of Silence.
16. I make open the gate of Bliss; I descend from the Palace of the
    Stars; I greet you, I embrace you, O children of Earth, that are
    gathered together in the Hall of Darkness.
17. (A pause.)
18. The Speech in the Silence.  
    The Words against the Son of Night.  
    The Voice of Tahuti in the Universe in the Presence of the
    Eternal.  
    The Formulas of Knowledge.  
    The Wisdom of Breath.  
    The Root of Vibration.  
    The Shaking of the Invisible.  
    The Rolling Asunder of the Darkness.  
    The Becoming Visible of Matter.  
    The Piercing of the Scales of the Crocodile.  
    The Breaking Forth of the Light!
19. (Follows the Lection.)
20. There is an end of the speech; let the Silence of darkness be
    broken; let it return into the silence of light.
21. The speaker silently departs; the listeners disperse unto their
    homes; yea, they disperse unto their homes.
