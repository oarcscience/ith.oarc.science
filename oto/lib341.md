I.  
**MMM. "I remember a certain holy day in the dusk of the Year, in the
dusk of the Equinox of Osiris, when first I beheld thee visibly; when
first the dreadful issue was fought out; when the Ibis-headed One
charmed away the strife. I remember thy first kiss, even as a maiden
should. Nor in the dark byways was there another: thy kisses abide." ---
LIBER LAPIDIS LAZULI. VII. 15. 16.**

1.  0\. Be seated in thine Asana, wearing the robe of a Neophyte, the
    hood drawn.
2.  It is night, heavy and hot, there are no stars. Not one breath of
    wind stirs the surface of the sea, that is thou. No fish play in thy
    depths.
3.  Let a Breath rise and ruffle the waters. This also thou shalt feel
    playing upon thy skin. It will disturb thy meditation twice or
    thrice, after which thou shouldst have conquered this distraction.
    But unless thou first feel it, that Breath hath not arisen.
4.  Next, the night is riven by the lightning flash. This also shalt
    thou feel in thy body, which shall shiver and leap with the shock,
    and that also must both be suffered and overcome.
5.  After the lightning flash, resteth in the zenith a minute point of
    light. And that light shall radiate until a right cone be
    established upon the sea, and it is day.  
    With this thy body shall be rigid, automatically; and this shalt
    thou let endure, withdrawing thyself into thine heart in the form of
    an upright Egg of blackness; and therein shalt thou abide for a
    space.
6.  When all this is perfectly and easily performed at will, let the
    aspirant figure to himself a struggle with the whole force of the
    Universe. In this he is only saved by his minuteness. But in the end
    he is overcome by Death, who covers him with a black cross.  
    Let his body fall supine with arms outstretched.
7.  So lying, let him aspire fervently unto the Holy Guardian Angel.
8.  Now let him resume his former posture.  
    Two and twenty times shall he figure to himself that he is bitten by
    a serpent, feeling even in his body the poison thereof. And let each
    bite be healed by an eagle or hawk, spreading its wings above his
    head, and dropping thereupon a healing dew. But let the last bite be
    so terrible a pang at the nape of the neck that he seemeth to die,
    and let the healing dew be of such virtue that he leapeth to his
    feet.
9.  Let there be now placed within his egg a red cross, then a green
    cross, then a golden cross, then a silver cross; or those things
    which these shadow forth. Herein is silence; for he that hath
    rightly performed the meditation will understand the inner meaning
    hereof, and it shall serve as a test of himself and his fellows.
10. Let him now remain in the Pyramid or Cone of Light, as an Egg, but
    no more of blackness.
11. Then let his body be in the position of the Hanged Man, and let him
    aspire with all his force unto the Holy Guardian Angel.
12. The grace having been granted unto him, let him partake mystically
    of the Eucharist of the Five Elements and let him proclaim Light in
    Extension; yea, let him proclaim Light in Extension.

**AAA "These loosen the swathings of the corpse; these unbind the feet
of Osiris, so that the flaming God may rage through the firmament with
his fantastic spear." Liber Lapidis Lazuli. VII. 3.**

1.  0\. Be seated in thine Asana, or recumbent in Shavasana, or in the
    position of the dying Buddha.
2.  Think of thy death; imagine the various diseases that may attack
    thee, or accidents overtake thee. Picture the process of death,
    applying always to thyself.  
    (A useful preliminary practice is to read textbooks of Pathology,
    and to visit museums and dissecting-rooms.)
3.  Continue this practice until death is complete; follow the corpse
    through the stages of embalming, wrapping and burial.
4.  Now imagine a divine breath entering thy nostrils.
5.  Next, imagine a divine light enlightening the eyes.
6.  Next, imagine the divine voice awakening the ears.
7.  Next, imagine a divine kiss imprinted on the lips.
8.  Next, imagine the divine energy informing the nerves and muscles of
    the body, and concentrate on the phenomenon which will already have
    been observed in 3, the restoring of the circulation.
9.  Last, imagine the return of the reproductive power, and employ this
    to the impregnation of the Egg of light in which man is bathed.
10. Now represent to thyself that this Egg is the Disk of the Sun,
    setting in the west.
11. Let it sink into blackness, borne in the bark of heaven, upon the
    back of the holy cow Hathor. And it may be that thou shalt hear the
    moaning thereof.
12. Let it become blacker than all blackness. And in this meditation
    thou shalt be utterly without fear, for that the blankness that will
    appear unto thee is a thing dreadful beyond all thy comprehension.  
    And it shall come to pass that if thou hast well and properly
    performed this meditation that on a sudden thou shalt hear the drone
    and booming of a Beetle.
13. Now then shall the Blackness pass, and with rose and gold shalt thou
    arise in the East, with the cry of an Hawk resounding in thine ear.
    Shrill shall it be and harsh.
14. At the end shalt thou rise and stand in the mid-heaven, a globe of
    glory. And therewith shall arise the mighty Sound that holy men have
    likened unto the roaring of a Lion.
15. Then shalt thou withdraw thyself from the Vision, gathering thyself
    into the divine form of Osiris upon his throne.
16. Then shalt thou repeat audibly the cry of triumph of the god
    re-arisen, as it shall have been given unto thee by thy Superior.
17. And this being accomplished, thou mayest enter again into the
    Vision, that thereby shall be perfected in Thee.
18. After this shalt thou return into the Body, and give thanks unto the
    Most High God IAIDA, yea unto the Most High God IAIDA.
19. Mark well that this operation should be performed if it be possible
    in a place set apart and consecrated to the Works of the Magick of
    Light. Also that the Temple should be ceremonially open as thou hast
    knowledge and skill to perform, and that at the end thereof the
    closing should be most carefully accomplished. But in the
    preliminary practice it is enough to cleanse thyself by ablution, by
    robing, and by the rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram.  
    0-2 should be practised at first, until some realisation is
    obtained; and the practice should always be followed by a divine
    invocation of Apollo or of Isis or of Jupiter or of Serapis.  
    Next, after a swift summary of 0-2 practice 3-7.  
    This being mastered, add 8.  
    Then add 9-13.  
    Then being prepared and fortified, well fitted for the work, perform
    the whole meditation at one time. And let this be continued until
    perfect success be attained therein. For this is a mighty meditation
    and holy, having power even upon Death, yea, having power even upon
    Death.  
    (Note by Fra. O.M. At any time during this meditation the
    concentration may bring about Samadhi. This is to be feared and
    shunned, more than any other breaking of control, for that it is the
    most tremendous of the forces which threaten to obsess. There is
    also some danger of acute delirious melancholia at point 1.)

**SSS "Thou art a beautiful thing, whiter than a woman in the column of
this vibration.  
"I shoot up vertically like an arrow, and become that Above.  
"But it is death, and the flame of the pyre.  
"Ascend in the flame of the pyre, O my Soul!  
"Thy God is like the cold emptiness of the utmost heaven, into which
thou radiatest thy little light.  
"When Thou shalt know me, O empty God, my flame shall utterly expire in
thy great N.O.X." Liber Lapidis Lazuli. I. 36-40.**

1.  0\. Be seated in thine Asana, preferably the Thunderbolt.  
    It is essential that the spine be vertical.
2.  In this practice the cavity of the brain is the Yoni; the spinal
    cord is the Lingam.
3.  Concentrate thy thought of adoration in the brain.
4.  Now begin to awaken the spine in this manner. Concentrate thy
    thought of thyself in the base of the spine, and move it gradually
    up a little at a time.  
    By this means thou wilt become conscious of the spine, feeling each
    vertebra as a separate entity. This must be achieved most fully and
    perfectly before the further practice is begun.
5.  Next, adore the brain as before, but figure to thyself its content
    as infinite. Deem it to be the womb of Isis, or the body of Nuit.
6.  Next, identify thyself with the base of the spine as before, but
    figure to thyself its energy as infinite. Deem it to be the phallus
    of Osiris or the being of Hadit.
7.  These two concentrations 4 and 5 may be pushed to the point of
    Samadhi. Yet lose not control of the will; let not Samadhi be thy
    master herein.
8.  Now then, being conscious both of the brain and the spine, and
    unconscious of all else, do thou imagine the hunger of the one for
    the other; the emptiness of the brain, the ache of the spine, even
    as the emptiness of space and the aimlessness of Matter.  
    And if thou hast experience of the Eucharist in both kinds, it shall
    aid thine imagination herein.
9.  Let this agony grow until it be insupportable, resisting by will
    every temptation. Not until thine whole body is bathed in sweat, or
    it may be in sweat of blood, and until a cry of intolerable anguish
    is forced from thy closed lips, shalt thou proceed.
10. Now let a current of light, deep azure flecked with scarlet, pass up
    and down the spine, striking as it were upon thyself that art coiled
    at the base as a serpent.  
    Let this be exceedingly slow and subtle; and though it be
    accompanied with pleasure, resist; and though it be accompanied with
    pain, resist.
11. This shalt thou continue until thou art exhausted, never relaxing
    the control. Until thou canst perform this one section 9 during a
    whole hour, proceed not. And withdraw from the meditation by an act
    of will, passing into a gentle Pranayama without Kumbhakham, and
    meditating on Harpocrates, the silent and virginal God.
12. Then at last, being well-fitted in body and mind, fixed in peace,
    beneath a favourable heaven of stars, at night, in calm and warm
    weather, mayst thou quicken the movement of the light until it be
    taken up by the brain and the spine, independently of thy will.
13. If in this hour thou shouldst die, is it not written, "Blessed are
    the dead that die in the Lord"? Yea, Blessed are the dead that die
    in the Lord!
