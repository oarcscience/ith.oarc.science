<p>51. Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers. The foundations 
  of the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did the king weep at 
  dawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the distant land?</p>
<p>52. There was also an humming-bird that spake unto the horned cerastes, and 
  prayed him for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the royal Uræus 
  serpent, answered him and said:</p>
<p>53. I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years, and I 
  saw not any creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of my fang is 
  the inheritance of my father, and of my father's father; and how shall I give 
  it unto thee? Live thou and thy children as I and my fathers have lived, even 
  unto an hundred millions of generations, and it may be that the mercy of the 
  Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld.</p>
<p>54. Then the humming-bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto the 
  flowers, and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet in a little 
  while a serpent struck him that he died.</p>
<p>55. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god listened 
  and heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a serpent, saying 
  Peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my children, 
  they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the Exalted One.</p>
<p>56. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Uræus serpent, and the 
  poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for 
  ever.</p>
<p align="center"><em>- Liber LXV</em>, Cap. V </p>
<p>I. <em>The Probationer</em>. His duties are laid down in Paper A, Class D. 
  Being without, they are vague and general. He receives Liber LXI and LXV.</p>

  receives Liber VII.</p>
<p>Examination in Liber O, caps. I-IV, Theoretical and Practical. </p>

<p>Examination in Posture and Control of Breath (see Equinox No. 1). Practical.</p>
<p>Further, he is given two meditation-practices corresponding to the two rituals 
  DCLXXI and CXX.</p>
<p>(Examination is only in the knowledge of, and some little practical acquaintance 
  with, these meditations. The complete results, if attained, would confer a much 
  higher grade.)</p>
<p>Further, he forges the magic Sword.</p>
<p>No ritual admits to the grade of Practicus, which is conferred by authority 
  when the task of the Zelator is accomplished.</p>
<p>4. <em>The Practicus</em>. His duties are laid down in Paper D, Class D.</p>
<p>Instruction and Examination in the Qabalah and Liber DCCLXXVII. </p>
<p>Instruction in Philosophical Meditation (Gnana-Yoga).</p>

  the Tarot. Theoretical. He is given a meditation-practice on Expansion of Consciousness.</p>
<p>He is given a meditation-practice in the destruction of thoughts. </p>
<p>Instruction and Examination in Control of Speech. Practical.</p>

<p>Instruction and Examination in Control of Action.</p>
<p>Further, he cuts the Magic Wand.</p>
<p>Finally, the Title of Dominus Liminis is conferred upon him.</p>
<p>He is given meditation-practices on the Control of Thought, and is instructed 
  in Raja-Yoga.</p>
<p>He receives Liber Mysteriorum and obtains a perfect understanding of the Formulae 
  of Initiation.</p>
<p>He meditates upon the diverse knowledge and power that he has acquired, and 
  harmonises it perfectly.</p>
<p>Further, he lights the Magic Lamp.</p>
<p>At last, Ritual VIII admits him to the grade of Adeptus Minor. </p>
<p>6. <em>The Adeptus Minor</em>. His duty is laid down in Paper F, Class D.</p>
<p>It is to follow out the instruction given in the Vision of the Eighth Aethyr 
  for the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>
<p>[NOTE. This is in truth the sole task; the others are useful only as adjuvants 
  to and preparations for the One Work.</p>
<p>Moreover, once this task has been accomplished, there is no more need of human 
  help or instruction; for by this alone may the highest attainment be reached.</p>
<p>All these grades are indeed but convenient landmarks, not necessarily significant. 
  A person who had attained them all might be immeasurably the inferior of one 
  who had attained none of them; it is Spiritual Experience alone that counts 
  in Result; the rest is but Method.</p>
<p>Yet it is important to possess knowledge and power, provided that it be devoted 
  wholly to that One Work.]
