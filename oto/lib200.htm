  <li>Let him greet the Sun at dawn, facing East, giving the sign of his grade. 
    And let him say in a loud voice:<br>
    Hail unto Thee who art Ra in Thy rising, even unto Thee who art Ra in Thy 
    strength, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Uprising of the 
    Sun.<br>
    Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.<br>
    Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Night!</li>
  <li>Also at Noon, let him greet the Sun, facing South, giving the sign of his 
    grade. And let him say in a loud voice:<br>
    Hail unto Thee who art Ahathoor in Thy triumphing, even unto Thee who art 
    Ahathoor in Thy beauty, who travellest over the heavens in thy bark at the 
    Mid-course of the Sun.<br>
    Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.<br>
    Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Morning!</li>
  <li>Also, at Sunset, let him greet the Sun, facing West, giving the sign of 
    his grade. And let him say in a loud voice:<br>
    Hail unto Thee who art Tum in Thy setting, even unto Thee who art Tum in Thy 
    joy, who travellest over the Heavens in Thy bark at the Down-going of the 
    Sun.<br>
    Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.<br>
    Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Day!</li>
  <li>Lastly, at Midnight, let him greet the Sun, facing North, giving the sign 
    of his grade, and let him say in a loud voice:<br>
    Hail unto thee who art Khephra in Thy hiding, even unto Thee who art Khephra 
    in Thy silence, who travellest over the heavens in Thy bark at the Midnight 
    Hour of the Sun.<br>
    Tahuti standeth in His splendour at the prow, and Ra-Hoor abideth at the helm.<br>
    Hail unto Thee from the Abodes of Evening.</li>
  <li>And after each of these invocations thou shalt give the sign of silence, 
    and afterward thou shalt perform the adoration that is taught thee by thy 
    Superior. And then do thou compose Thyself to holy meditation.</li>
  <li>Also it is better if in these adorations thou assume the God-form of Whom 
    thou adorest, as if thou didst unite with Him in the adoration of That which 
    is beyond Him. 
  <li>Thus shalt thou ever be mindful of the Great Work which thou hast undertaken 
    to perform, and thus shalt thou be strengthened to pursue it unto the attainment 
    of the Stone of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.</li>
