    daily use is wise.

    issue of the O.T.O. NEWSLETTER.

**WILL:**

> > Knock: 333 - 55555 - 333 (total 11 knocks)
> >
> > "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
> >
> > \*\* What is thy will?
> >
> > It is my will to eat and drink.
> >
> > \*\* To what end?
> >
> > That my body may be fortified thereby.

These are the practices that the Order requires for the First Degree. An
examination is required in these practices ( a perfect score is not
necessary) before advancement to the Second Degree.

    Program. All are important.
2.  Select and become proficient in at least one of the following: LIBER
    XXV, LIBER XLVI, LIBER V, or LIBER DCCC ( Liber Samekh ).
3.  Begin or continue a particular study in one of the following:
    Qabalah, Divination, Yoga, Astral Workings or a like discipline.
4.  Perform some work that will endure beyond your own physical life-
    time: write and be published, speak in public, produce a work of
    art, have and nuture a child or perform some similiar work that will
    pass beyond your own mind, and beyond the minds of your immediate
    associates.
5.  Perform some work for the benefit of your Brothers and Sisters in
    the Order: Provide time and work in organization, correspond with
    isolated initiates, share your insights, volunteer for specific

    needed by the Order.
6.  Join with fellow initiates in a Chapter, Lodge, or other group of
    the Order.
7.  Analyze your magickal diary from some definite point of view; e.g.
    endeavor to determine the point at which virtue becomes vice, as:
    sympathy degenerating into pity, advice into meddling, temperance
    into apathy, excellence into illusion, gentleness into shallowness
    and like matters. Record your findings in your diary with both
    theoretical views and actual examples from your daily life.
