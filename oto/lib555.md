## A.·. A.·. Publication in Class D (for Winners of the Ordeal X.) Imprimatur: {three flags/axes meaning "Neteru"}... V.V.V.V.V. ... N. Fra A.·. A.·. O.M. 7° = 4Square.

000\. This is the Book of the Cult of the Infinite Within.

00\. The Aspirant is Nuit. Nuit is the infinite expansion of the Rose;
Hadit the infinite concentration of the Rood. *(Instruction of
V.V.V.V.V.)*

0\. First let the Aspirant learn in his heart the Second Chapter of the
Book of the Law. *(Instruction of V.V.V.V.V.)*

1.  Worship, *i.e.* identify thyself with, Nuit, as a lambent flame of
    blue, all-touching, all-penetrant, her lovely hands upon the black
    earth, and her lithe body arched for love, and her soft feet not
    hurting the little flowers, even as She is imaged in the Stele of
    Revealing.  
    *This is the first practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 26).*
2.  Let him further identify himself with the heart of Nuit, whose
    ecstasy is in that of her children, and her joy to see their joy,
    who sayeth: I love you! I yearn to you. Pale or purple, veiled or
    voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the
    innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arose the coiled
    splendour within you: come unto me! ... Sing the rapturous love-song
    unto me! Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I
    love you! I love you! I am the blue-lidded daughter of Sunset; I am
    the naked brilliance of the voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!  
    *This is the second practice of Meditation (ccxx. I. 13, 61, 63, 64,
    65).*
3.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as an unextended
    point clothed with Light ineffable. And let him beware lest he be
    dazzled by that Light.  
    *This is the first practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 2).*
4.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the ubiquitous
    centre of every sphere conceivable.  
    *This is the second practice of Intelligence (ccxx. I. 2).*
5.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the soul of
    every man, and of every star, conjoining this in his Understanding
    with the Word (cxx. I. 2). "Every man and every woman is a star."
    Let this conception be that of Life, the giver of Life, and let him
    perceive that therefore the knowledge of Hadit is the knowledge of
    death.  
    *This is the third practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 6).*
6.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the Magician
    or maker of Illusion, and the Exorcist or destroyer of Illusion,
    under the figure of the axle of the Wheel, and the cube in the
    circle. Also as the Universal Soul of Motion.  
    (This conception harmonises Thoth and Harpocrates in a very complete
    and miraculous manner. Thoth is both the Magus of Taro (see [Lib.
    418](418/418)) and the Universal Mercury; Harpocrates both the
    destroyer of Typhon and the Babe on the Lotus. Note that the "Ibis
    position" formulates this conception most exactly. ED.)  
    *This is the fourth practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 7).*
7.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the perfect,
    that is Not, and solve the mystery of the numbers of Hadit and his
    components by his right Ingenium.  
    *This is the fifth practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 15, 16).*
8.  Let the Aspirant, bearing him as a great King, root out and destroy
    without pity all things in himself and his surroundings which are
    weak, dirty, or diseased, or otherwise unworthy. And let him be
    exceeding proud and joyous.  
    *This is the first practice of Ethics (ccxx. II. 18, 19, 20, 21).*
9.  Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the Snake that
    giveth Knowledge and Delight and bright glory, who stirreth the
    hearts of men with drunkenness. This snake is blue and gold; its
    eyes are red, and its spangles green and ultra-violet.  
    (That is, as the most exalted form of the Serpent Kundalini.)  
    *This is the sixth practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 22, 50, 51).*
10. Let him further identify himself with this Snake.  
    *This is the second practice of Meditation (ccxx. II. 22).*
11. Let the Aspirant take wine and strange drugs, according to his
    knowledge and experience, and be drunk thereof.  
    (The Aspirant should be in so sensitive a condition that a single
    drop, perhaps even the smell, should suffice. ED.)  
    *This is the first practice of Magick Art (ccxx. II. 22).*
12. Let the Aspirant concentrate his consciousness in the Rood Cross set
    up upon the Mountain, and identify himself with It. Let him be well
    aware of the difference between Its own soul, and that thought which
    it habitually awakes in his own mind. *This is the third practice of
    Meditation, and as it will be found, a comprehension and harmony and
    absorption of the practices of Intelligence (ccxx, II. 22).*
13. Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as the Unity
    which is the Negative. (Ain Elohim. ED.)  
    *This is the seventh practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 23).*
14. Let the Aspirant live the life of a strong and beautiful being,
    proud and exalted, contemptuous of and fierce toward all that is
    base and vile.  
    *This is the second practice of Ethics (ccxx. II. 24, 25, 45-49, 52,
    56- 60).*
15. Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit according to this
    26th verse of the Second Chapter of the Book of the Law. And this
    shall be easy for him if he have well accomplished the Third
    Practice of Meditation.  
    *This is the eighth practice of Intelligence (ccxx, II. 26).*
16. Let the Aspirant destroy Reason in himself according to the practice
    in Liber CDLXXIV.  
    *This is the fourth practice of Meditation (ccxx. II. 27-33).*
17. Let the Aspirant observe duly the Feasts appointed by the A.'. A.'.
    and perform such rituals of the elements as he possesseth, invoking
    them duly in their season.  
    *This is the second practice of Magick Art (ccxx. II. 35-43).*
18. Let the Aspirant apply himself to comprehend Hadit as a babe in the
    egg of the Spirit (Akasha. ED.) that is invisible within the 4
    elements.  
    *This is the ninth practice of Intelligence (ccxx. II. 49).*
19. The Aspirant seated in his Asana will suddenly commence to breathe
    strangely, and this without the Operation of his will; the
    Inspiration will be associated with the thought of intense
    excitement and pleasure, even to exhaustion; and the Expiration very
    rapid and forceful, as if this excitement were suddenly released.  
    *This is the first and last Indication of the Sign of the Beginning
    of this Result (ccxx. II. 63).*
20. A light will appear to the Aspirant, unexpectedly. Hadit will arise
    within him, and Nuit concentrate Herself upon him from without. He
    will be overcome, and the Conjunction of the Infinite Without with
    the Infinite Within will take place in his soul, and the One be
    resolved into the None.  
    *This is the first Indication of the Nature of the Result (ccxx. II.
    61, 62, 64).*
21. Let the Aspirant strengthen his body by all means in his power, and
    let him with equal pace refine all that is in him to the true ideal
    of Royalty. Yet let his formula, as a King's ought, be Excess.  
    *This is the third practice of Ethics (ccxx. II. 70, 71).*
22. To the Aspirant who succeeds in this practice the result goes on
    increasing until its climax in his physical death in its due season.
    This practice should, however, prolong life.  
    *This is the second Indication of the Nature of the Result
    (ccxx. II. 66, 72-74).*
23. Let the Adept aspire to the practice of [Liber XI](lib11). and
    preach to mankind.  
    *This is the fourth Practice of Ethics (ccxx. II. 76).*
24. Let the Adept worship the Name, foursquare, mystic, wonderful, of
    the Beast, and the name of His house; and give blessing and worship
    to the prophet of the lovely Star.  
    *This is the fifth practice of Ethics (ccxx. II. 78, 79).*
25. Let the Aspirant expand his consciousness to that of Nuit, and bring
    it rushing inward. It may be practised by imagining that the Heavens
    are falling, and then transferring the consciousness to them.  
    *This is the fifth practice of Meditation. (Instruction of
    V.V.V.V.V.)*
