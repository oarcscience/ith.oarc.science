INTRODUCTION  

This Rite, taken from materials in Crowley's Diary has the same
numeration as Liber CXX, SAMEKH.

In the matter of the directions, there are several markouts that make
unclear whether he intends to use the ordinary elemental directions: E.
Air, S. Fire, W. Water, N. Earth (as is implied in [Liber
Samekh](lib800), and used in the Lesser Pentagram, [Star Ruby](lib25.md)
and others) or if he intends the Directions of the Cherubic Signs (as in
the Planetary Stations): E. Fire, S. Earth, W. Air, N. Water (used in
the Lesser Hexagram, the [Star Sapphire](lib36) and others.md) or even the
directions in [Liber Reguli](lib5.md): N. Air, S. Fire, E. Earth, W.Water.

The only set of directions that agree with the order of the Spell itself
(ignoring markouts on the directions) and go in order of the verse to be
said, is that of the Elemental Directions, which I have used.

There are a couple of other lacunae that I have not attempted to fill
in, though it is obvious what is intended.

Crowley sent this Ritual to Frater Semper Peratus as part of the
material involved in an Order called "The Order of Thelemites".

In the Order of Thelemites (as also given in Liber AL vel Legis) there
are but three grades: the Hermit, the Lover, and the Man of Earth. In
all official documents of the Order (of Thelemites) they are referred to
as Magister, Adeptus, and Zelator.

The requirements to pass beyond the Grade of Zelator to the Grade of
Adeptus are that the candidate has completed the regular training of the
Argentum Astrum prior to the Grade of Adeptus.

The requirements for passage beyond the Grade of Adeptus to the Grade of
Magister are that the candidate be at least a Lord of the Paths of the
Vault of the Adepts, that eleven years as an Adeptus be completed, that
the Grade of Babe of the Abyss in the Argentum Astrum be completed, and
that there be a retirement from all active work in the Order involving
contact with groups.

There were several other and more stringent requirements that also had
to be undergone according to the Constitution: pledge forms had to be
signed and other work completed.

Several papers were attached to this, which includes the opening and
closing of the Temple, as well as the Initiation Ritual for Zelator
(which has to be performed under four eyes).

These were:

Schedule A: Opening, Closing, Initiatiation Ritual of Zelators (this
paper).

Schedule B: The Form of Initiation of Adepti (it is explicitly stated
that there shall be no Form of Initiation for Magisters).

Schedule C: Gives the Conditions by which Magisteri appoint Adepti to
help Zelators, and notes that the general plan of the O.T.O. is to be
put before all members of the Order ( of Thelemites).

Ritual CXX called "of Passing through the Tuat". OPENING:

(Members assembled, clothed, throned)

Enter the Hierophant

(All rise and salute him.) The "Ceremony of Recognition" followeth. But
all, or one, shall show on entering the Temple The Mark of the Beast
lest the Guardian of the Temple be hasty with them.

All words and numbers affirmed, (crieth the Hierophant or Magus):

"ABRAHADABRA. Hail unto thee, Heru-Ra-Ha, Ra-Hoor, ABRAHADABRA Lord of
the Day!

The Dark of the Sun is sunk in the waters of Amentet. Let there be a
gathering of the Lords of Silence!"

111-11111-111

(He knocketh, He riseth, and giveth the 3 signs of...

Taking the weapon of which he means to work through out, or if he be
assisted by a child, the appropriate weapon be advanced to the center
and crieth:

"I am armed! I am armed! I am strong! I am strong!"

(He goes to the West, where dwell the Undines.)

"With my wand I drive back the dwellers of water"

(To the South, where are Salamanders.)

"Let the dwellers of Fire cower before the Fire of my Sword!"

(In the East, the home of the Sylphs.)

"Let the winds draw back at the waving of the spear!"

(In the North, among the gnomes)

"I have imprisoned the inhabitants of Earth. Let them keep silence
before me."

(Returns to center.)

"I am armed! I am strong!

Let them bow, before the splendor of Ra-Hoor-Khuit!"

(Next he performeth the 4 adorations as taught unto the outer world.)

"I am the Lord of Thebes, and I  
The inspired forth-speaker of Mentu;  
For me unveils the veiled sky,  
The self-slain Ankh-af-na-khonsu  
Whose words are truth. I invoke, I greet  
Thy presence, O Ra-Hoor-Khuit!

Unity uttermost showed!  
I adore the might of Thy breath,  
Supreme and terrible God,  
Who makest the gods and death  
To tremble before Thee:-  
I, I adore thee!

Appear on the throne of Ra!  
Open the ways of the Khu!  
Lighten the ways of the Ka!  
The ways of the Khabs run through  
To stir me or still me!  
Aum! let it fill me!

The light is mine; its rays consume  
Me: I have made a secret door  
Into the House of Ra and Tum,  
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.  
I am thy Theban, O Mentu,  
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!

By Bes-na-Maut my breast I beat;  
By wise Ta-Nech I weave my spell.  
Show thy star-splendour, O Nuit!  
Bid me within thine House to dwell,  
O winged snake of light, Hadit!  
Abide with me, Ra-Hoor-Khuit!"

(Followeth the mystical dance as taught in secret: or let the Magus
trace 11 circles around the room, traveling against the course of the
Sun, for that is in effect He that is still, the Earth revolving.)

(Let the hymn be sung, or the Mantra recited. But ere he end, let him
sing:)

"Above, the gemmed azure is  
The naked splendour of Nuit;  
She bends in ecstasy to kiss  
The secret ardours of Hadit.  
The winged globe, the starry blue,  
Are mine, O Ankh-af-na-khonsu!"

(Then he cometh to the East of the Throne of Ra and crieth:)

"Unity uttermost showed!  
I adore the might of Thy breath,  
Supreme and terrible God,  
Who makest the gods and death  
To tremble before Thee:-  
I - I adore thee!"

(Prostrating himself to the W. Then he resumes his Throne, assuming the
Might of the God & saith:)

"The light is mine; its rays consume  
Me: I have made a secret door  
Into the House of Ra and Tum,  
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.  
I am thy Theban, O Mentu,  
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!"

(Silence: then:)

"ABRAHADABRA 111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh.)

**CLOSING:**

"ABRAHADABRA!

Hail unto thee, that art Ra in thy Rising! The Disk of Khephra standeth
upon the waters of Amentet: It is the Hour of the Dispersal of the Lords
of Silence."

111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh)

(Rising, he doeth the ceremony, precisely as in the opening unto the 2nd
verse of the song called the spell. But he goeth with the Sun, as
allowing Nature to resume her sway. At the E. of the Throne of Ra he
standeth and crieth:)

"It is the Hour of the Feast of Ra-Hoor-Khuit."

(Lifting up the cakes of the Holy one of Light, the priest shall
recite:)

"I fly like an hawk! I perch upon that abode of the Aat on the festival
of the Mighty one of light. Let us live upon that which the Gods give
us, & the Khus; let us live and get power by these cakes; let us eat
them before the gods and the Khus; let us get power by these cakes! Let
us eat thereof under the shade of the leaves of the Palm tree of that
..., our Lady and our Holy one of Heaven!

Let the offering of the Sacrifice (He maketh such) and the offering of
cakes (He lifteth them) and vessels of libation (He poureth it) be made
in them!

My head is like unto the Head of Ra, and my limbs are strong as the
limbs of Tum.

My tongue is the tongue of Ptah & my throne is the Throne of our Lady
Ahathoor.

I utter the words of my father Tum; the handmaid of Seb is constrained,
and all are bowed in fear before me.

They glorify me in their hymns; divine Hair of Seb is the name wherein
They do invoke me to protect the Earth, who am its Lord and God. The god
Seb refreshing me maketh his ... as mine own.

The dwellers in Amun bow down their heads unto me for I am their Lord,
their Bull.

I am more powerful than the Lord of Time; I shall enjoy the pleasures of
love, and gain the mastery over millions of years."

(He then resumeth the Throne of Ra, as the might of god, saying:)

"The light is mine; its rays consume  
Me: I have made a secret door  
Into the House of Ra and Tum,  
Of Khephra and of Ahathoor.  
I am thy Theban, O Mentu  
The prophet Ankh-af-na-khonsu!"

(Rising he moveth to the West or as some say to the South saying with
the sign:)

"Hathoor, Lady of Amentet, mighty dweller in the funeral mountain, eye
of Ra, dweller before Him, beautiful of fire in the boat of millions of
years, be they favorable unto us, and let Thy light and beauty be with
us Thy lovers in the House of Peace!

ABRAHADABRA 111 - 11111 - 111 (He knocketh)

\[This opening and closing of the Temple is observable on all occasions.
Any other ceremony, such as Evocation, Invocation, Initiation and all
secret Rituals, should be performed when the Temple is "open". Also, in
the case of Initiations their Birth, Death, and Marriage, (with such
additional Rituals as may be taught) should take place actually in an
open Temple.

Followeth the ceremony of admitting a Neophyte to the Mysteries, which
is to be performed upon him before he is admitted to an Ordeal.\]

The Ritual called "Passing through the TUAT"

(The officers are Three in number, invisible are Ta-Nech for Nuit,
Bes-n-Maut for Hadit. Thence cometh forth Visable, the lowest point of
the Red Triangle of our Order, Ankh-f-n-Khonsu for Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The
ceremony is to join the candidate, or ego, with him.

The officer is also Tem, to open, Ra to close; Kephra, to Admit, and
Ahathoor, to seal the grade. He is thus the Pentagram in himself, ...
the Hierophant. His dress is that of the Magus described by Abramelin.
The wand is in his hand; but the spear and sword are ready. The
candidate, dresses as is his custom, fasts for four and twenty hours.
Before the admission he eats a full meal. Then the officer, approaching
sayeth:)

"Hail! hail unto thee O Tum, who comest forth from the abyss of water!
Hail unto thee, who shinest with double splendour, let thy words be
spoken with might unto those Khus that abide in the Hall, and let ------
Triumphant enter into their assembly. ------ hath performed the decree
which hath been spoken to the armies of Ra at eventide; therefore let
him/her come forth as a living khu in the place of the Dead; let the
gods rejoice , one and all, crying aloud: Hail! ---------- ! even as
they cry: Hail, O Ptah that ariseth from the Holy Place of the ancient
One that is Annu!"

(The candidate then undresses; and is clad in the shroud of a corpse.
His feet and hands are wrapped closely, his mouth is stopped, and his
eyes are blindfolded. He is then placed in the Coffin. The officer
approaches, now that the coffin has been carried into the darkened
temple. He stops with a napkin dipped in the consecrated water the
nostrils of the candidate, much distressing him.)

"Hail thou God Temu, grant unto me the sweet breath that dwelleth in thy
nostrils!"

(The officer unstops the nostrils of the Candidate, and breaths from his
nostrils upon them.)

"Homage to thee, O thou Lord of Brightness, at the head of the great
House, prince of the night & of thick darkness, I am come forth as a
pure Khu. My two hands are behind me and my lot is as that of my
forefathers! O grant thou me thy mouth, that I may speak therewith, and
guide thou to me mine heart in the hour of cloud and darkness!"

(The officer removes the mouth wrapping, and kisses the candidate upon
the mouth.)

"Homage to thee, O Ra, who in thy setting art Tum-Heru-Khut, of thou
divine one, O Thou who hast formulated Thy Father & made fertile thy
mother! Thou primeval orb, whence all things arise!

When thou appearest in the back of thy Bark men shout for joy at thee,
thou maker of the gods! Thou didst stretch out the heaven wherein thy
two eyes might travel, thou didst make the Earth to be a vast chamber
for thy Khus, so that every man might know his fellow. The Sektet boat
is glad, and the Matet Boat rejoiceth, and they greet thee with
exaltation as thou journeyest along. The God Nu is content and thy
mariners are satisfied. The Uraeus hath overthrown thine enemies & thou
hast carried off the legs of Apep!"

(The officer unbinds the legs of the Candidate.)

"Thou art beautiful O Ra, each day; and thy mother Nuit embraceth thee;
thou settest in beauty and thy heart is glad when thou in the horizon of
Manu the mountain of the West; and the Holy ones thereof rejoice. The
hearts of the Lords of the Tuat are glad when thou sendest forth thy
light in Amentet; Their two eyes are directed towards thee!"

(The officer removes the eye-bandage, makes a flash of light, and gazes
deeply into the eyes of the candidate, as he says:)

"They press forward to see thee; their hearts rejoice when they see thee
at the end!"

Thou hearkeneth unto the cries of them that are in the funeral Chest;
thou dost away with their helplessness and drivest away the evils that
are about them."

(The officer unbinds & presses the hands of the candidate.)

"I am thy father that lifteth thee up!"

(He raises the Candidate.)

"Thou givest breath to their nostrils, and they take hold of the bows of
thy Bark in the horizon of Manu. Thou art beautiful every day, O Ra! May
thy mother Nuit embrace ------ victorious!"

(The officer looses and lets fall the shroud, and embraces the
Candidate.

The officer leaves the Candidate, and circumambulates the temple 11
times widdershins, chanting the song 'Even as the traitors breath...
etc.)

(He then approaches the Candidate and says:)

"Repeat after me: I who am nothing deny all that I was; I who am nothing
affirm all that I shall be. I swear that as Nuit is about me, as Hadit
is within me, so am I Ra-Hoor-Khuit! And blessing and worship to the
Beast, the prophet of the Lovely Star!"

(The officer withdrawing the brand 666 from the altar, marks the
Candidate on brow, heart, & head.

The officer now circumambulates the temple 11 times reciting:)

"I am the girdle of the robe of the god Nu (here he robes the candidate
in the proper robe) which shineth and sheddeth light upon that which
belongeth to his breast, sending forth light into darkness, bringing to
peace the two gods that are at war in his heart.

Mine is the mighty spell that raiseth up him that was fallen.

I have taken possession of the Lord of Darkness; I have rescued the eye
of the Sun.

I have brought forth Thoth, and made even the scales of balance.

Mine is the Ureret-Crown; Maat is in my body; its' mouths are of
turquoise and rock crystals; my home is among the burrows of
lapis-lazuli: I am he that sheddeth light in the darkness: The darkness
is made light and bright by me.

I have given light in the darkness.

I have overthrown the devourers.

I have sung praises to them that dwell in the darkness.

I have raised up those that wept, that had hidden their faces and sunk
down for sorrow; and they did look upon me.

Hail, for I am He whose voice is silence.

I have opened the way; I have made light the darkness; I am come, having
made an end of the darkness, which hath become light indeed."

(The lights are turned fully on. The candidate is led from the Temple to
the ... of the boat. This boat is 7 cubits in length. It is of green
porcelain, and canopied with a heaven of stars, consecrated. At the bow
is the golden Disk of RA, with his image. The officer says:)

"The paths which are above are laid unto rest ... Hail thou great god
who art in thy boat, bring thou me into thy boat."

(The officer puts the candidate into the boat.)

"I have entered the boat and I sail by the command of Ra.

(Place canopy of heaven over the boat.)

"Get thee back o serpent dwellers in Fire, that maketh to  
cease the motion of my boat. Get thee back to the sky, for that  
which is in my hand is ready.  
I stand up in the place of restraint; the boat advanceth  
taking heed to thy way; thy head is covered up while I sail on  
over the heaven.  
I am he who lifteth up strength; I am come; I am become  
master of the serpents of RA when he setteth in my sight, at  
eventide I go round about heaven; but thou art fettered with the  
fetters that Ra hath ordained.  
I, even I, guide the ... wherewith Apep is driven back, and  
I know the divine souls of the West: Tum, and Sebek the lord of  
Baklan, and Hathoor the lady of the Evening."

(The boat advances:)

"I, even I know the eastern gate of heaven whence RA cometh  
with a favorable wind. I am the helmsman of the eternal Bark; I  
know the two sycamores of ... between which RA showeth himself.  
I, even I, know the divine souls of the East, Heru-khuit,  
and the calf of the Goddess Khera, the Bright morning star.

(The boat advances to the first Pylon.)

"Get thee back! Return! Get thee back, thou crocodile Sui!  
Thou shalt not advance to me, for I live by the magical  
words of my mouth."

(The boat circles the Temple deosil, leaves it, & again faces the Pylon.
So for each utterance. )

"My front teeth are like knives & my jaw-teeth are like unto  
his that dwelleth upon the Hill of Terror!"

(Circle)

"Hail thou that sittest with thine eyeballs upon my magical words."

(Circle)

"Thou shalt not carry me away, O thou serpent Rerek, and  
advance not hither unto me! Stand thou still and thou shall eat  
the vat of the abomination unto Ra! Thou shalt crunch the bones  
of the Cat of Slime!"

(Circle)

"Depart from me, Aphast, for thou hast lips that gnaw! For I  
am Khnemu, the Lord of ... Peshemu ... I bring the words of the  
gods to RA.

(Circle)

"Homage to you, ye two Rekht Goddesses, ye sisters twin."

(Circle)

"Hail ye two Mert goddesses, I bring a message to you  
concerning my magical words.  
I shine from the Sektet boat.  
I am Ra-Hoor-Kaa, the sun of strength and light."

(Circle)

"Get thee back, depart, get thee back from me, O Apep!  
Depart from the divine place of Ra's birth, where in is the  
House of thy Terror!

I am Ra, terrible and triumphant.  
Ra setteth, Ra setteth; Ra is strong at his setting.  
Apep hath fallen; Apep the enemy of Ra is overcome.

(Circle)

"Get thee back, Hai, thou impure one, abomination of Asar!  
Tahuti hath cut off thine head and I have slain thee and  
hurled thee utterly asunder. Get thee back from the Neshuet boat,  
as with a fair wind Ra saileth over his heaven.

(Circle)

"O thou Scepter of joy! Let me not be hurt of any; nor by  
man, nor by gods, nor by the holy dead, nor by the violently  
slain, nor by them of old times, nor by any mortal, nor by any  
human soul!"

(The boat entereth the temple, and circleth it, but not going out; it is
brought to the center thereof. The canopy is removed.)

"My hair is the hair of Nu!  
My face is the face of the Disk!  
My eyes are the eyes of Hathor!  
My ears are the ears of Apu-t!  
My nose is the nose of Kheuti Khas!  
My lips are the lips of Anpu!  
My teeth are the teeth of Serget!  
My neck is the neck of Asi!  
My shoulders are the shoulders of Ba-neb-Tahtu!  
My arms are the arms of Neith!  
My spine is the spine of Sati!  
My phallus is the phallus of Asar!  
(or) My kteis is the kteis of Asi!  
My Sinews are the sinews of the Lords of Keraba!  
My chest is the chest of the mighty and terrible one!  
My belly and back are the belly and back of Sekhet.  
My buttocks are the buttocks of the Eye of Hoor.  
My hips and legs are the hips and legs of Nuit!  
My feet are the feet of Ptah!  
My bones are the bones of the living Gods!  
There is no member of my body that is not the member of some God!

\[The officer, who has touched each part of the candidate (as he has
named it) with his wand now raises him from the boat, and embraces him,
kissing his brow. Then cries he with a loud voice:)

"ABRAHADABRA! I receive thee into the Order of Thelema!"

(He knocks 111 - 11111 - 111 )

(The boat has been removed. The candidate kneels at the altar, while the
officer makes "THE GREAT INVOCATION" from his throne.)

(They then walk round the temple eleven times widdershins, the left arm
of the officer around the waist of the candidate, and the candidates
right arm around him. The officer sayeth as they go:)

"I am a swallow! I am a swallow! I am the scorpion, the  
daughter of Ra.  
Hail thou flame whose scent is sweet!  
Hail, ye gods whose scent is sweet!  
Hail thou flame that cometh from the horizon!  
Hail thou Lord of the city; stretch out thy hand unto me,  
let me advance with my tidings, for my speech is of  
great gladness.  
Open the doors to me, and I will declare the things that I  
have seen!  
Horus hath become the divine Prince of the Boat of the Sun;  
unto him hath been given the name of his father Osiris.  
I have stretched out my arms at the word of Osiris; I am  
entered in, I am justified, I come forth worthy at the gate.  
I am pure at the palace of the passage of souls;  
I have destroyed the evil that clung to my members upon  
earth.  
Hail, ye twin Hawks upon your pinnacles, ye that guard the  
gate of the abyss, for I am made as ye!  
I am He that cometh forth by day.  
I have passed the hidden ways; yea \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I am He, the  
Bornless Spirit, having Sight in the feet; strong and  
the immortal fire!  
I am He, the Truth!  
I am He, that hate that evil should be wrought in the world!  
I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth!  
I am He, from whom is the shower of the life of Earth.  
I am He, whose mouth ever flameth!  
I am He, the begetter and manifester unto the light.  
I am He, the grace of the World!  
The heart girt with a serpent is my name!"

(They go to the Throne.)

"O my seat, O my Throne, come unto me! and be Ye round about me!"

(He sets the candidate on his Throne.)

"I am your Lord, O ye Gods, Come ye and take your places in my train!"

(The officer prostrates himself before the Candidate, and worships him.)

(The officer rises and takes his spear from beside the candidate. He
touches with its point the brand 666 and says:)

"As this brand is not to be effaced from thy body, so is this Initiation
not to be effaced from thy soul!"

(The officers then lead him from the Throne and biddeth him stand at the
altar, while the closing is performed. Afterward (s)he may entertain
him/her, in the precincts of the Holy House to a banquet and act
friendly toward him.)

(end)

"Your fathers hath fed on the manna in the wilderness and are dead."
