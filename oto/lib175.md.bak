## A.·. A.·. Publication in Class B. Imprimatur: N. Fra A.·. A.·.

0\. This is the Book of Uniting Himself to a particular Deity by
devotion.

1.  *Considerations before the Threshold.* First concerning the choice
    of a particular Deity. This matter is of no import, sobeit that thou
    choose one suited to thine own highest nature. Howsoever, this
    method is not so suitable for gods austere as Saturn, or
    intellectual as Thoth. But for such deities as in themselves partake
    in anywise of love it is a perfect mode.

2.  *Concerning the prime method of this Magick Art.* Let the devotee
    consider well that although Christ and Osiris be one, yet the former
    is to be worshipped with Christian, and the latter with Egyptian
    rites. And this although the rites themselves are ceremonially
    equivalent. There should, however, be *one* symbol declaring the
    transcending of such limitations; and with regard to the Deity also,
    there should be some *one* affirmation of his identity both with all
    other similar gods of other nations, and with the Supreme of whom
    all are but partial reflections.

3.  *Concerning the chief place of devotion.* This is the Heart of the
    Devotee, and should be symbolically represented by that room or spot
    which he loves best. And the dearest spot therein shall be the
    shrine of his temple. It is most convenient if this shrine and altar
    should be sequestered in woods, or in a private grove, or garden.
    But let it be protected from the profane.

4.  *Concerning the Image of the Deity.* Let there be an image of the
    Deity; first because in meditation there is mindfulness induced
    thereby; and second because a certain power enters and inhabits it
    by virtue of the ceremonies; or so it is said, and We deny it not.
    Let this image be the most beautiful and perfect which the devotee
    is able to procure; or if he be able to paint or to carve the same,
    it is all the better. As for Deities with whose nature no Image is
    compatible, let them be worshipped in an empty shrine. Such are
    Brahma, and Allah. Also some postcaptivity conceptions of Jehovah.

5.  *Further concerning the shrine*. Let this shrine be furnished
    approÿriately as to its ornaments, according to the book 777. With
    ivy and pine-cones, that is to say, for Bacchus, and let lay before
    him both grapes and wine. So also for Ceres let there be corn, and
    cakes; or for Diana moon-wort and pale herbs, and pure water.
    Further it is well to support the shrine with talismans of the
    planets, signs and elements appropriate. But these should be made
    according to the right Ingenium of the Philosophus by the light of
    the Book 777 during the course of his Devotion. It is also well,
    nevertheless, if a magick circle with the right signs and names be
    made beforehand.

6.  *Concerning the Ceremonies.* Let the Philosophus prepare a powerful
    Invocation of the particular Deity according to his Ingenium. But
    let it consist of these several parts:  
    First, an Imprecation, as of a slave unto his Lord.  
    Second, an Oath, as of a vassal to his Liege.  
    Third, a Memorial, as of a child to his Parent.  
    Fourth, an Orison, as of a Priest unto his God.  
    Fifth, a Colloquy, as of a Brother with his Brother.  
    Sixth, a Conjuration, as to a Friend with his Friend.  
    Seventh, a Madrigal, as of a Lover to his Mistress.  
    And mark well that the first should be of awe, the second of fealty,
    the third of dependence, the fourth of adoration, the fifth of
    confidence, the sixth of comradeship, the seventh of passion.

7.  *Further concerning the ceremonies*. Let then this Invocation be the
    principal part of an ordered ceremony. And in this ceremony let the
    Philosophus in no wise neglect the service of a menial. Let him
    sweep and garnish the place, sprinkling it with water or with wine
    as is appropriate to the particular Deity, and consecrating it with
    oil, and with such ritual as may seem him best. And let all be done
    with intensity and minuteness.

8.  *Concerning the period of devotion, and the hours thereof.* Let a
    fixed period be set for the worship; and it is said that the least
    time is nine days by seven, and the greatest seven years by nine.
    And concerning the hours, let the Ceremony be performed every day
    thrice, or at least once, and let the sleep of the Philosophus be
    broken for some purpose of devotion at least once in every night.  
    Now to some it may seem best to appoint fixed hours for the
    ceremony, to others it may seem that the ceremony should be
    performed as the spirit moves them so to do: for this there is no
    rule.

9.  *Concerning the Robes and Instruments*. The Wand and Cup are to be
    chosen for this Art; never the Sword or Dagger, never the Pantacle,
    unless that Pantacle chance to be of a nature harmonious. But even
    so it is best to keep the Wand and Cup, and if one must choose, the
    Cup.  
    For the Robes, that of a Philosoÿhus, or that of an Adept Within is
    most suitable; or, the robe best fitted for the service of the
    particular Deity, as a bassara for Bacchus, a white robe for Vesta.
    So also, for Vesta, one might use for instrument the Lamp; or the
    sickle, for Chronos.

10. *Concerning the Incense and Libations.* The incense should follow
    the nature of the particular Deity; as, mastic for Mercury, dittany
    for Persephone. Also the libations, as, a decoction of nightshade
    for Melancholia, or of Indian hemp for Uranus.

11. *Concerning the harmony of the ceremonies.* Let all these things be
    rightly considered, and at length, in language of the utmost beauty
    at the command of the Philosophus, accompanied, if he has skill, by
    music, and interwoven, if the particular Deity be jocund, with
    dancing. And all being carefully prepared and rehearsed, let it be
    practised daily until it be wholly rhythmical with his aspiration,
    and as it were, a part of his being.

12. *Concerning the variety of the ceremonies.* Now, seeing that every
    man differeth essentially from every other man, albeit in essence he
    is identical, let also these ceremonies assert their identity by
    their diversity. For this reason do We leave much herein to the
    right Ingenium of the Philosophus.

13. *Concerning the life of the devotee.* First, let his way of life be
    such as is pleasing to the particular Deity. Thus to invoke Neptune,
    let him go a-fishing; but if Hades, let him not approach the water
    that is hateful to Him.

14. *Further, concerning the life of the devotee.* Let him cut away from
    his life any act, word, or thought, that is hateful to the
    particular Deity; as, unchastity in the case of Artemis, evasions in
    the case of Ares. Besides this, he should avoid all harshness or
    unkindness of any kind in thought, word, or deed, seeing that above
    the particular Deity is One in whom all is One. Yet also he may
    deliberately practise cruelties, where the particular Deity
    manifests His Love in that manner, as in the case of Kali, and of
    Pan. And therefore, before the beginning of his period of devotion,
    let him practise according to the rules of Liber Jugorum.

15. *Further concerning the life of the devotee.* Now, as many are fully
    occupied with their affairs, let it be known that this method is
    adaptable to the necessities of all.  
    And We bear witness that this which followeth is the Crux and
    Quintessence of the whole Method.  
    First, if he have no Image, let him take anything soever, and
    consecrate it as an Image of his God. Likewise with his robes and
    instruments, his suffumigations and libations: for his Robe hath he
    not a nightdress; for his instrument a walking stick; for his
    suffumigation a burning match; for his libation a glass of water?  
    But let him consecrate each thing that he useth to the service of
    that particular Deity, and not profane the same to any other use.

16. *Continuation.* Next, concerning his time, if it be short. Let him
    labour mentally upon his Invocation, concentrating it, and let him
    perform this Invocation in his heart whenever he hath the leisure.
    And let him seize eagerly upon every opportunity for this.

17. *Continuation.* Third, even if he have leisure and preparation, let
    him seek ever to bring inward the symbols, so that even in his well
    ordered shrine the whole ceremony revolve inwardly in his heart,
    that is to say in the temple of his body, of which the outer temple
    is but an image. For in the brain is the shrine, and there is no
    Image therein; and the breath of man is the incense and the
    libation.

18. *Continuation.* Further concerning occupation. Let the devotee
    transmute within the alembic of his heart every thought, or word, or
    act into the spiritual gold of his devotion.  
    As thus: eating. Let him say: "I eat this food in gratitude to my
    Deity that hath sent it to me, in order to gain strength for my
    devotion to Him."  
    Or: sleeping. Let him say: "I lie down to sleep, giving thanks for
    this blessing from my Deity, in order that I may be refreshed for
    new devotion to Him."  
    Or: reading. Let him say: "I read this book that I may study the
    nature of my Deity, that further knowledge of Him may inspire me
    with deeper devotion to Him."  
    Or: working. Let him say: "I drive my spade into the earth that
    fresh flowers (fruit, or what not) may spring up to His glory, and
    that I, purified by toil, may give better devotion to Him."  
    Or: whatever it may be that he is doing, let him reason it out in
    his own mind, drawing it through circumstance and circumstance to
    that one end and conclusion of the matter. And let him not perform
    the act until he hath done this.  
    As it is written: [Liber VII](lib7.md), cap. v. ---

    > *22. Every breath, every word, every thought is an  
    > act of love with thee.  
    > 23. The beat of my heart is the pendulum of love.  
    > 24. The songs of me are the soft sighs:  
    > 25. The thoughts of me are very rapture:  
    > 26. And my deeds are the myriads of Thy Children,  
    > the stars and the atoms.*

    And Remember Well, that if thou wert in truth a lover, all this
    wouldst thou do of thine own nature without the slightest flaw or
    failure in the minutest part thereof.

19. *Concerning the Lections.* Let the Philosoÿhus read solely in his
    copies of the holy books of Thelema, during the whole period of his
    devotion. But if he weary, then let him read books which have no
    part whatever in love, as for recreation.  
    But let him copy out each verse of Thelema which bears upon this
    matter, and ponder them, and comment thereupon. For therein is a
    wisdom and a magic too deep to utter in any other wise.

20. *Concerning the Meditations.* Herein is the most potent method of
    attaining unto the End, for him who is thoroughly prepared, being
    purified by the practice of the Transmutation of deed into devotion,
    and consecrated by the right performance of the holy ceremonies. Yet
    herein is danger, for that the Mind is fluid as quicksilver, and
    bordereth upon the Abyss, and is beset by many sirens and devils
    that seduce and attack it to destroy it. Therefore let the devotee
    beware, and precise accurately his meditations, even as a man should
    build a canal from sea to sea.

21. *Continuation.* Let then the Philosophus meditate upon all love that
    hath ever stirred him. There is the love of David and of Jonathan,
    and the love of Abraham and Isaac, and the love of Lear and
    Cordelia, and the love of Damon and Pythias, and the love of Sappho
    and Atthis, and the love of Romeo and Juliet, and the love of Dante
    and Beatrice, and the love of Paolo and Francesca, and the love of
    Caesar and Lucrezia Borgia, and the love of Aucassin and Nicolette,
    and the love of Daphnis and Chloe, and the love of Cornelia and
    Caius Gracchus, and the love of Bacchus and Ariadne, and the love of
    Cupid and Psyche, and the love of Endymion and Artemis, and the love
    of Demeter and Persephone, and the love of Venus and Adonis, and the
    love of Lakshmi and Vishnu, and the love of Siva and Bhavani, and
    the love of Buddha and Ananda, and the love of Jesus and John, and
    many more.  
    Also there is the love of many saints for their particular deity, as
    of St. Francis of Assisi for Christ, of Sri Sabhapaty Swami for
    Maheswara, of Abdullah Haji Shirazi for Allah, of St Ignatius Loyola
    for Mary, and many more.  
    Now do thou take one such story every night, and enact it in thy
    mind, grasping each identity with infinite care and zest, and do
    thou figure thyself as one of the lovers and thy Deity as the other.
    Thus do thou pass through all adventures of love, not omitting one;
    and to each do thou conclude: How pale a reflection is this of my
    love for this Deity!  
    Yet from each shalt thou draw some knowledge of love, some intimacy
    with love, that shall aid thee to perfect thy love. Thus learn the
    humility of love from one, its obedience from another, its intensity
    from a third, its purity from a fourth, its peace from yet a
    fifth.  
    So then thy love being made perfect, it shall be worthy of that
    perfect love of His.

22. *Further concerning meditation.* Moreover let the Philosophus
    imagine to himself that he hath indeed succeeded in his devotion,
    and that his Lord hath appeared to him, and that they converse as
    may be fitting.

23. *Concerning the Mysterious Triangle.* Now then as three cords
    separately may be broken by a child, while those same cords duly
    twisted may bind a giant, let the Philosophus learn to entwine these
    three methods of Magic into a Spell.  
    To this end let him understand that as they are One, because the end
    is one, so are they One because the method is One, even the method
    of turning the mind toward the particular Deity by love in every
    act.  
    And lest thy twine slip, here is a little cord that wrappeth tightly
    round and round all, even the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.

24. *Concerning the Mantram or Continuous Prayer.* Let the Philosophus
    weave the Name of the Particular Deity into a sentence short and
    rhythmical, as, for Artemis:
    epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu,
    epsilon-pi-epsilon-lambda-theta-omicron-nu,
    Alpha-rho-tau-epsilon-mu-iota-sigma; or, for Shiva: Namo Shivaya
    namaha Aum; or, for Mary: Ave Maria; or for Pan,
    chi-alpha-iota-rho-epsilon Sigma-omega-tau-eta-rho
    kappa-omicron-sigma-mu-omicron-upsilon, Iota-omega Pi-alpha-nu,
    Iota-omega Pi-alpha-nu; or, for Allah: Hua Allahu alazi lailaha illa
    Hua.  
    Let him repeat this day and night without cessation mechanically in
    his brain, which is thus made ready for the advent of that Lord, and
    armed against all other.

25. *Concerning the Active and the Passive.* Let the Philosophus change
    from the active love of his particular Deity to a state of passive
    waiting, even almost a repulsion, the repulsion not of distaste, but
    of sublime modesty.  
    As it is written, Liber LXV.ii.59. I have called unto Thee, and I
    have journeyed unto Thee, and it availed me not. 60. I waited
    patiently, and Thou wast with me from the beginning.  
    Then let him change back to the Active, until a veritable rhythm is
    established between the states, as it were the swinging of a
    Pendulum. But let him reflect that a vast intelligence is required
    for this; for he must stand as it were almost without himself to
    watch those phases of himself, And to do this is a high Art, and
    pertaineth not altogether to the grade of Philosoÿhus. Neither is it
    of itself helpful, but rather the reverse, in this especial
    practice.

26. *Concerning silence.* Now there may come a time in the course of
    this practice when the outward symbols of devotion cease, when the
    soul is as it were dumb in the presence of its God. Mark that this
    is not a cessation, but a transmutation of the barren seed of prayer
    into the green shoot of yearning. This yearning is spontaneous, and
    it shall be left to grow, whether it be sweet or bitter. For often
    times it is as the torment of hell in which the soul burns and
    writhes unceasingly. Yet it ends, and at its end continue openly thy
    Method.

27. *Concerning Dryness.* Another state wherein at times the soul may
    fall is this dark night. And this is indeed purifying in such depths
    that the soul cannot fathom it. It is less like pain than like
    death. But it is the necessary death that comes before the rising of
    a body glorified.  
    This state must be endured with fortitude; and no means of
    alleviating it may be employed. It may be broken up by the breaking
    up of the whole Method, and a return to the world without. This
    cowardice not only destroys the value of all that has gone before,
    but destroys the value of the Oath of Fealty that thou hast sworn,
    and makes thy Will a mockery to men and gods.

28. *Concerning the Deceptions of the Devil.* Note well that in this
    state of dryness a thousand seductions will lure thee away; also a
    thousand means of breaking thine oath in spirit without breaking it
    in letter. Against this thou mayst repeat the words of thine oath
    aloud again and again until the temptation be overcome.  
    Also the devil will represent to thee that it were much better for
    this operation that thou do thus and thus, and seek to affright thee
    by fears for thy health or thy reason.  
    Or he may send against thee visions worse than madness.  
    Against all this there is but one remedy, the Discipline of thine
    Oath. So then thou shalt go through ceremonies meaningless and
    hideous to thee, and blaspheme shalt thou against thy Deity and
    curse Him. And this mattereth little, for it is not thou, so be that
    thou adhere to the Letter of thine Obligation. For thy Spiritual
    Sight is closed, and to trust it is to be led unto the precipice,
    and hurled therefrom.

29. *Further of this matter.* Now also subtler than all these terrors
    are the Illusions of Success. For one instant's {WEH NOTE: Magick in
    Theory and Practice has "But one instant's..."} self-satisfaction or
    Expansion of thy Spirit, especially in this state of dryness, and
    thou art lost. For thou mayst attain the False Union with the Demon
    himself. Beware also of even the pride which rises from having
    resisted the temptations.  
    But so many and so subtle are the wiles of Choronzon that the whole
    world could not contain their enumeration.  
    The answer to one and all is the persistence in the literal
    fulfilment of the routine. Beware, then, last, of that devil {49}
    who shall whisper in thine ear that the letter killeth, but the
    spirit giveth life, and answer: Except a corn of wheat fall into the
    ground, and die, it abideth alone, but if it die, it bringeth forth
    much fruit.  
    Yet shalt thou also beware of disputation with the devil, and pride
    in the cleverness of thine answers to him. Therefore, if thou hast
    not lost the power of silence, let it be first and last employed
    against him.

30. *Concerning the Enflaming of the Heart.* Now learn that thy methods
    are dry, one and all. Intellectual exercises, moral exercises, they
    are not Love. Yet as a man, rubbing two dry sticks together for
    long, suddenly found a spark, so also from time to time will true
    love leap unasked into thy mediation. Yet this shall die and be
    reborn again and again. It may be that thou hast no tinder near.  
    In the end shall come suddenly a great flame and a devouring, and
    burn thee utterly.  
    Now of these sparks, and of these splutterings of flame, and of
    these beginnings of the Infinite Fire, thou shalt thus be aware. For
    the sparks thy heart shall leap up, and thy ceremony or meditation
    or toil shall seem of a sudden to go of its own will; and for the
    little flames this shall be increased in volume and intensity; and
    for the beginnings of the Infinite Fire thy ceremony shall be caught
    up unto ravishing song, and thy meditation shall be ecstasy, and thy
    toil shall be a delight exceeding all pleasure thou hast ever
    known.  
    And of the Great Flame that answereth thee it may not be spoken; for
    therein is the End of this Magick Art of Devotion.

31. *Considerations with regard to the use of symbols.* It is to be
    noted that persons of powerful imagination, will, and intelligence
    have no need of these material symbols. There have been certain
    saints who are capable of love for an idea as such without it being
    otherwise than degraded by "idolising" it, to use this word in its
    true sense. Thus one may be impassioned of beauty, without even the
    need of so small a concretion of it as "The beauty of Apollo", the
    "beauty of roses", the "beauty of Attis". Such persons are rare; it
    may be doubted whether Plato himself attained to any vision of
    absolute beauty without attaching to it material objects in the
    first place. A second class is able to contemplate ideals through
    this veil; a third class need a double veil, and cannot think of the
    beauty of a rose without a rose before them. For such is this Method
    of most use; yet let them know that there is this danger therein,
    that they may mistake the gross body of the symbol for the idea made
    concrete thereby.

32. *Considerations of further danger to those not purged of material
    thought.* Let it be remembered that in the nature of the love itself
    is danger. The lust of the satyr for the nymph is indeed of the same
    nature as the affinity of Quicklime for water on the one hand, and
    of love of Ab for Ama on the other; so also is the triad Osiris,
    Isis, Horus like that of a horse, mare, foal, and of red, blue,
    purple. And this is the foundation of Correspondences.  
    But it were false to say "Horus is a foal" or "Horus is purple". One
    may say: "Horus resembles a foal in this respect, that he is the
    offspring of two complementary beings".

33. *Further of this matter.* So also many have said truly that all is
    one, and falsely that since earth is That One, and ocean is That
    One, therefore earth is ocean. Unto Him good is illusion, and evil
    is illusion; therefore good is evil. By this fallacy of logic are
    many men destroyed.  
    Moreover, there are those who take the image for the God; as who
    should say, my heart is in Tiphereth, and an Adeptus is in
    Tiphereth; I am therefore an adept.  
    And in this practice the worst danger is this, that the love which
    is its weapon should fail in one of two ways.  
    First, if the love lack any quality of love, so long is it not ideal
    love. For it is written of the Perfected One: "There is no member of
    my body which is not the member of some god." Therefore let not the
    Philosophus despise any form of love, but harmonise all. As it is
    written: Liber LXV, 32. "So therefore Perfection abideth not in the
    Pinnacles or in the Foundation, but in the harmony of One with
    all."  
    Second, if any part of this love exceed, there is disease therein.
    As, in the love of Othello for Desdemona, love's jealousy overcame
    love's tenderness, so may it be in this love of a particular Deity.
    And this is more likely, since in this divine love no element may be
    omitted.  
    It is by virtue of this completeness that no human love may in any
    way attain to more than to foreshadow a little part thereof.

34. *Concerning Mortifications.* These are not necessary to this method.
    On the contrary, they may destroy the concentration, as
    counter-irritants to, and so alleviations of, the supreme
    mortification which is the Absence of the Deity invoked.  
    Yet as in mortal love arises a distaste for food, or a pleasure in
    things naturally painful, this perversion should be endured and
    allowed to take its course. Yet not to the interference with natural
    bodily health, whereby the instrument of the soul might be
    impaired.  
    And concerning sacrifices for love's sake, they are natural to this
    Method, and right.  
    But concerning voluntary privations and tortures, without use save
    as against the devotee, they are generally not natural to healthy
    natures, and wrong. For they are selfish. To scourge one's self
    serves not one's master; yet to deny one's self bread that one's
    child may have cake is the act of a true mother.

35. *Further concerning Mortifications.* If thy body, on which thou
    ridest, be so disobedient a beast that by no means will he travel in
    the desired direction, or if thy mind be baulkish and eloquent as
    Balaam's fabled Ass, then let the practice be abandoned. Let the
    shrine be covered in sackcloth, and do thou put on habits of
    lamentation, and abide alone. And do thou return most austerely to
    the practice of [Liber Jugorum](lib3.md), testing thyself by a standard
    higher than that hitherto accomplished, and punishing effractions
    with a heavier goad. Nor do thou return to thy devotion until that
    body and mind are tamed and trained to all manner of peaceable
    going.

36. *Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. I. Rising on
    the planes.* By this method mayst thou assist the imagination at the
    time of concluding thine Invocation. Act as taught in Liber O, by
    the light of Liber 777.

37. *Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. II. Talismanic
    Magic.* Having made by thine Ingenium a talisman or pantacle to
    represent the particular Deity, and consecrated it with infinite
    love and care, do thou burn it ceremonially before the shrine, as if
    thereby giving up the shadow for the substance. But it is useless to
    do this unless thou do really in thine heart value the talisman
    beyond all else that thou hast.

38. *Concerning minor methods adjuvant in the ceremonies. III.
    Rehearsal.* It may assist if the traditional history of the
    particular Deity be rehearsed before him; perhaps this is best done
    in dramatic form. This method is the main one recommended in the
    "Exercitios Espirituales" of St Ignatius, whose work may be taken as
    a model. Let the Philosophus work out the legend of his own
    particular Deity, and apportioning days to events, live that life in
    imagination, exercising the five senses in turn, as occasion arises.

39. *Concerning minor matters adjuvant in the ceremonies. IV. Duresse.*
    This method consists in cursing a deity recalcitrant; as,
    threatening ceremonially "to burn the blood of Osiris, and to grind
    down his bones to power." This method is altogether contrary to the
    spirit of love unless the particular Deity be himself savage and
    relentless; as Jehovah or Kali. In such a case the desire to perform
    constraint and cursing may be the sign of the assimilation of the
    spirit of the devotee with that of his God, and so an advance to the
    Union with HIm.

40. *Concerning the value of this particular form of Union or Samadhi.*
    All Samadhi is defined as the ecstatic union of a subject and object
    in consciousness, with the result that a third thing arises which
    partakes in no way of the nature of the two.  
    It would seem at first sight that it is of no importance whatever to
    choose an object of meditation. For example, the Samadhi called
    Atmadarshana might arise from simple concentration of the thought on
    an imagined triangle, or on the heart.  
    But as the union of two bodies in chemistry may be endothermic or
    exothermic, the combination of Oxygen with Nitrogen is gentle, while
    that of Oxygen with Hydrogen is explosive; and as it is found that
    the most heat is disengaged as a rule by the union of bodies most
    opposite in character, and that the compound resulting from such is
    most stable, so it seems reasonable to suggest that the most
    important and enduring Samadhi results from the contemplation of the
    Object most pposite to the devotee. \[On other planes, it has been
    suggested that the most opposed types make the best marriages and
    produce the healthiest children. The greatest pictures and operas
    are those in which violent extremes are blended, and so generally in
    every field of activity. Even in mathematics, the greatest
    parallelogram is formed if the lines composing it are set at right
    angles. ED.\]

41. *Conclusions from the foregoing.* It may then be suggested to the
    Philosophus, that although his work will be harder his reward will
    be greater if he choose a Deity most remote from his own nature.
    This method is harder and higher than that of [Liber E](lib9.md). For a
    simple object as there suggested is of the same nature as the
    commonest things of life, while even the meanest Deity is beyond
    uninitiated human understanding. On the same plane, too, Venus is
    nearer to man than Aphrodite, Aphrodite than Isis, Isis than
    Babalon, Babalon than Nuit.  
    Let him decide therefore according to his discretion on the one hand
    and his aspiration on the other; and let not one outrun his fellow.

42. *Further concerning the value of this Method.* Certain objections
    arise. Firstly, in the nature of all human love is illusion, and a
    certain blindness. Nor is there any true love below the Veil of the
    Abyss. For this reason we give this method to the Philosoÿhus, as
    the reflection of the Exempt Adept, who reflects the Magister Templi
    and the Magus. Let then the Philosophus attain this Method as a
    foundation of the higher Methods to be given to him when he attains
    those higher grades.  
    Another objection lies in the partiality of this Method. This is
    equally a defect characteristic of the Grade.

43. *Concerning a notable danger of Success.* It may occur that owing to
    the tremendous power of the Samadhi, overcoming all other memories
    as it should and does do, that the mind of the devotee may be
    obsessed, so that he declare his particular Deity to be sole God and
    Lord. This error has been the foundation of all dogmatic religions,
    and so the cause of more misery than all other errors combined.  
    The Philosophus is peculiarly liable to this because from the nature
    of the Method he cannot remain sceptical; he must for the time
    believe in his particular Deity. But let him (1) consider that this
    belief is only a weapon in his hands, (2) affirm sufficiently that
    his Deity is but an emanation or reflection or eidolon of a Being
    beyond him, as was said in Paragraph 2. For if he fail herein, since
    man cannot remain permanently in Samadhi, the memorised Image in his
    mind will be degraded, and replaced by the corresponding Demon, to
    his utter ruin.  
    Therefore, after Success, let him not delight overmuch in his Deity,
    but rather busy himself with his other work, not permitting that
    which is but a step to become a goal. As it is written also, Liber
    CLXXXV.: "remembering that Philosophy is the Equilibrium of him that
    is in the House of Love."

44. *Concerning the secrecy and the rites of Blood.* During this
    practice it is most wise that the Philosophus utter no word
    concerning his working, as if it were a Forbidden Love that
    consumeth him. But let him answer fools according to their folly;
    for since he cannot conceal his love from his fellows, he must speak
    to them as they may understand.  
    And as many Deities demand sacrifice, one of men, another of cattle,
    a third of doves, let these sacrifices be replaced by the true
    sacrifices in thine own heart. Yet if thou must symbolise them
    outwardly for the hardness of thine heart, let thine own blood, and
    not another's, be spilt before that altar. \[The exceptions to this
    rule pertain neither to this practice, nor to this grade. N. Fra.
    A.·. A.·..\]  
    Nevertheless, forget not that this practice is dangerous, and may
    cause the manifestation of evil things, hostile and malicious, to
    thy great hurt.

45. *Concerning a further sacrifice.* Of this it shall be understood
    that nothing is to be spoken; nor need anything be spoken to him
    that hath wisdom to comprehend the number of the paragraph. And this
    sacrifice is fatal beyond all, unless it be a sacrifice indeed. Yet
    there are those who have dared and achieved thereby.

46. *Concerning yet a further sacrifice.* Here it is spoken of actual
    mutilation. Such acts are abominable; and while they may bring
    success in this Method, form an absolute bar to all further
    progress.  
    And they are in any case more likely to lead to madness than to
    Samadhi. He indeed who purposeth them is already mad.

47. *Concerning human affection.* During this practice thou shalt in no
    wise withdraw thyself from human relations, only figuring to thyself
    that thy father or thy brother or thy wife is as it were an image of
    thy particular Deity. Thus shall they gain, and not lose, by thy
    working. Only in the case of thy wife this is difficult, since she
    is more to thee than all others, and in this case thou mayst act
    with temperance, lest her personality overcome and destroy that of
    thy Deity.

48. *Concerning the Holy Guardian Angel.* Do thou in no wise confuse
    this invocation with that.

49. *The Benediction.* And so may the love that passeth all
    Understanding keep your hearts and minds through Iota-Alpha-Omega
    Alpha-Delta-Omicron-Nu-Alpha-Iota Sigma-Alpha-Beta-Alpha-Omega and
    through BABALON of the City of the Pyramids, and through Astarte,
    the Starry One green-girdled, in the name ARARITA. AMN.
