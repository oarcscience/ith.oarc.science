## {Zeta }{alpha } DE VIA SOLA SOLIS.

This is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this Holy Herb, he Grass of
the Arab, that it has shewed me this Mystery (with many others) not as a
new Light, for I had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and
Manifestation of a Long Sequence of Events in a Moment, I had Wit to
analyse this Method, and to discover its Essential Law, which before had
escaped the Focus of the Lens of mine Understanding. Yea, o my Son,
there is no true Path of Light, save that which I have formerly made
plain; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be cunning to perceive it
and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes by Reflection or by the
Composition and Selection of an Artist in his Presentation thereof, when
else we were blind thereunto; lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were that
Art of none avail unless we had already the Root of that Truth in our
Nature, and a Bud ready to flower at the Summoning of that Sun. In
Witness, nor a Boy nor a Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone,
and their Properties; but thou mayst teach hese to the Boy by right
Presentation, because he hath in his Nature those laws of Mind that are
consonant with our Art Mathematical, and hath Need only of the Fledging
(I may say his) so that he apply them consciously to the Work, when all
being in Truth, that is, in the necessary Relations that rule our
Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension.

## {Zeta }{beta } DE PRUDENTIA ORDINIS A{.·.} A{.·.}

Here then o my Son, that shall be mightier than all the Kings of the
Earth, as it is prophesied, ---an thou be He--- because thou shalt
establish the Law which I have given, even he Law of Thelema, here in
this which I have written is a Point of Judgment in they Work to bring
into the Light of Initiation such as come unto thee, affirming their
Will to his Attainment. For every One hath his own Path and his own Law,
and there is no Art in Magick but to seek out that Path and that Law,
that he may pursue the one by the right Used of he Other. It shall be
that one cometh unto thee, desiring Amen-Ra (I speak in a Figure or
Exemplar) another Asi, a third Hoor-Pa-Kraat; or again, one seeketh
Instruction in Obeah, and his Fellow in Wanga; and of all these not one
in Ten Thousand shall be aware of his true Way. For albeit our last step
is one for all, yet his next stem is particular to each. Therefore is
the Preparation of a Student that seeketh Our Holy Order of A{.'.}
A{.'.} most general, informing his Mind of all known Methods, so that
his Will may select among these by Instinct: then after, as a
Probationer, he practiseth those which he hath preferred, and by the
Examination of his Record after the Period appointed thou mayst have
Wisdom concerning him, to confirm him in those Ways which are shewed
thereby to be germane to his True Nature.

## {Zeta }{gamma } ALTERA DE SUA VIA.

Thus I was brought unto the Knowledge of myself in a certain secret
Grace, and as a Poet, by Jerome Politt of Kendal; Oscar Eckenstein of
the Mountain discovered Manhood in me, teaching me to endure Hardship,
and to dare many Shapes of Death; also he nurtured me in Concentration,
the Art of the Mystics, but without Lumber of Theology. Allan Bennett
bestowed upon me the right Art of Magic, and Our Holy Qabalah, with a
great Treasure of Learning in many Matters, but especially concerning
Egypt, and Asia, the Mysteries of their Arcane Wisdom. But of Cecil
Jones had I the Great Gift of the Holy Magick of Abramelin, and he
inducted me into that Order which we name not, because of the Silliness
of the Profane hat pretend thereto, and he brought me to the Knowledge
and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel; also, he was the Herald of
the Masters of the Temple when They bade me welcome o their Order,
appointing a Siege for me in the City of the Pyramids, under the Night
of Pan; but for three Years I was not willing to avail myself thereof.
Now mark well this, o my Son, that this Path was peculiar to the law of
my Star, and none other should follow me herein, or seek to follow me,
for he hath his own proper Orbit. O my Son, err not by Generalisation
and Conformity, for this is the very Idleness, and breedeth Ideals and
Standards that are Death.

## {Zeta }{delta } DE PRUDENTIA ARTIS DOCENDI.

Nevertheless, this one Affliction shall touch nigh all that come to
thee, and that is this great Pox of Sin, that is our Bane inherited of
the Aeon of Slain Gods. Look the first of all, when any Postulant boweth
before thee, whether there be not Conflict and Restriction in his Mind,
and in his Will. If he deem Good and Evil to be absolute, instead of as
relative o the Health of this Body, or the Weal of the Society of which
he is a Member, or what not, as it may be, instruct him. Or, if he will
say that he will sacrifice all for Initiation, correct him, as it is
written: "but whoso gives one Particle of Dust shall lose all in that
Hour." For it is Conflict if he weigh one Thing with another; and
Renunciation, being sorrowful, is not worthy of Acceptance. But he must
with Joy unite all he is and hath, heaping the Whole into one Billow of
Love, under Will. Yea, o my son, until thou hast brought the Postulant
into our Freedom from Sin, and the Sense and Conviction thereof, he is
not ready for the Path of our Magick and Illumination; because every Way
soever is a Going, and his Sin is an obstacle and a Fetter and an
Hoodwink on every one of them, for it is Restriction, whether he set out
by the Meditations of the Dhamma, or by Our Qabalah, or by Vision or
Theurgy, or how else soever.

## {Zeta }{epsilon } DE MENTE INIMICA ANIMO.

How shall a Man attain to the Trance where All is One, if he yet debate
within his Mind concerning Virtue as a Thing Absolute? Thus, o my Son,
there be those that are fuddled with Doubt whether Meat is to be eaten
(I choose this as a Reference with Habit is proper to the Lion, as Grass
to the Horse, so that his right Problem is solely thus, what is fitting
to his own Nature. Or again, I suppose that he is in Vision, and an
Angel, visiting him, imparteth a Truth contrary o his Prejudice, as it
fell out in mine own Case, when I inhabited the Body of Sir Edward
Kelly, or so do I in Part remember, as it seemeth dimly. This
nevertheless is sure (or he learned Casaubon, publishing the Record of
that Word with he Magician Dee, sayeth falsely) that an Angel did
declare unto Kelly the very Axiomata of our Law of Thelema, in good
Measure, and plainly; but Dee, afflicted by the Fixity of his Tenets
that were of the Salve-Gods, was wroth, and by his Authority prevailed
upon the other, who was indeed not wholly perfected as an Instrument, or
the World ready for that Sowing. Consider also how in this very Life I
was the Enemy of mine own Law, and wrote down "The Book of the Law"
contrary o my conscious Will by the Virtue of Obedience as a Scribe, and
strove constantly to escape mine own Work, and the Utterance of my Word,
until by Initiation I was made All-One.

## {Zeta }{digamma } DE ILLUMINATUM OPERIBUS DIVERSIS.

Do thou understand how few be they whose Work in this their present
Lives is our Way of Initiation. Yet it is written in "The Book of the
Law" that the Law is for all, so that thou shalt in no wise err if thou
establish it as the formula of he Aeon, universal among Men. Also, ever
for them that are fitted to advance in our Light, there is Order and
Diversity in Function, as reagardeth their Work in our Sub;lime
Brotherhood, Thus, it might well be that, in a Profess-House of the
Temple, or College of the Holy Ghost, each Knight or Brother might
severally attain Experience of every Trance, unto the Perfection of all
Illumination; yet by this there ought not to arise Confusion, one
usurping the appointed office of another. For the Abbot, although he be
not enlightened wholly, is yet Abbot; and the Place of the Cook, were he
Saint, Arhan, and Paramahamsa in one Person, is in his Kitchen. Confound
not thou in any wise therefore the Degree of Attainment of any Man with
his right Function in our Holy Order; for although by initiation cometh
the Light, and the Right, and the Might to accomplish all Works soever,
yet these are inoperative save as they are able to use a Machine which
is of the same Order of Things as the Effect required. As the best
Swordsman hath Need of a Sword, so hath every magician of a Body and
Mind capable to the Work that he willeth; and he can do nothing, save it
be proper to his Nature.

## {Zeta }{zeta } DE EADEM RE ALTERA VERBA.

By this Understanding be they rebuked that make a Reproach o our Art,
saying in their Insolence that if we have all Power, why are we betimes
in Stress of Poverty, and in Contempt of men, and in Pain of Disease,
and so forth, mocking us, and holding our Magick for Delusion. But they
behold not our Light, how it guideth us in our Path unto a Goal that is
not in their Comprehension, so that we crave not that which seemeth to
them the Sole Food and Comfort of Life. Also, this which we attain,
though it be the Essence of Omniscience and Omnipotence, informeth and
moveth the Matherial World (so to call it) only according to the Nature
of that which is herein. For the Light of the Sun (by His very Wholeness
itself) sheweth a Rose Red, but a Leaf Green; and His Heat gathereth the
Clouds, and disperseth them also. So I then, hough I were perfect ion
Magick, might not work in Metals as a Smith, or become rich by Commerce
as a Merchant; for I have not in my Nature the Engines proper to these
Capacities, and herefore it is not of my will to seek to exercise them.
Here hen is my Case, that I can not because I will not, and it were
Conflict, should I turn thither. But let every man become perfect in his
own Work, not heeding the Rebuke of another, that some Way not his own
is more Noble, or Profitable, but being constant in mindfulness
concerning his Business.

## {Zeta }{eta } DE PACE PERFECTA LUCE.

How shall the measure our Statue and our Success by that Cannon of
Relation and Illusion, and their ignorance of our Nature? Time is but
Sequence, and a moment of Light outweigheth an Age of Darkness. What is
Happiness but the Issue of the Harmony of our Consciousness with our
Truth, and he Conformity of Will with Action? To the Initiate is
Certainty of his Fulfilment, which to the Profane is but the Effect of
Hazard, and he feareth to lose what he loveth, or hinketh he loveth. But
we, loving only in Light, suffer not by Fear or by Bereavement, because
to us every Event is Welcome, being right, necessary and proper to our
particular Path. The Knowledge of this one Matter is the End of Dread
and of Regret; make it the Governor of thy Mind, to rule its Pace, lest
it hasten or lag by Stress of thine Environment. How this Attainment is
possible for all Mankind, since it asketh but Resolution of Complexities
that already exist; so hat this true Wisdom and Happiness cometh by the
Acceptance of our Law, and its Use is the Key to all locked Doors of the
Mind, and the Reconcilement of every Contention. O my Son, in he
Promulgation of the Law lieth the Reward of our Chief Work, the making
whole of Mankind from the Conscience of Sin which divideth him, and
afflicteth his Spirit.

## {Zeta }{theta } DE PACE PERFECTA.

O my Son, is it not a marvel, this Light whereof we are the Quintessence
and the Seed? By it are we made Whole, dissolved in the Body and in the
Soul of Our Lady Nuith even as Her Lord Hadith, so that the Gnostic
Sacrament of the Cosmos is perpetually Elevated before us. We behold all
that is and comprehend its Mystery, and its Order in this High Mass
eternally celebrated among us, acknowledging the Perfection of he Rite,
neither confusing the Parts thereof, nor discriminating in Worship
between them. So unto us is every Phenomenon a Shew of Godliness,
proceeding continually in a Pageant that returneth unto itself,
identical in the Phase of Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia
of Ineffable Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of Beauty
in Variety inexhaustible. Shall the Initiate bestir him, to better so
prime a Perfection? Nay, this Will that was his is accomplished; he hath
attained the Summit; so without Hope or Fear he abideth, and leaveth his
Vehicle of Illusion and Magical Engine, that is, as Man say, his Body
and Mind, to work out their Ritual of Change without his interference. O
my son, ask not to what End! As it is written in "The Book of the Heart
Girt with the Serpent", concerning the Boy and the Swan: is there not
joy ineffable in this aimless Winging?

## {Zeta }{iota } DE MORTE.

Thou hast made Question of me concerning Death, and this is my Opinion,
of which I say not: this is the Truth. First in he Temple called Man is
the God, his Soul, or Star, individual and eternal, but also inherent in
the Body of Our Lady Nuith. Now this Soul, as an Officer in the High
Mass of he Cosmos, taketh on the Vesture of his Office, that is,
inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Illusion, a Body and Mind. And his Tabernacle
is Subject to the Law of Change, for it is complex, and diffuse reacting
to every Stimulus or Impression. If then the mind be attached constantly
to the Body, Death hath no Power to decompose it wholly, but a decaying
Shell of he dead Man, his Mind holding together for a little his Body of
Light, haunteth the Earth, seeking a new Tabernacle (in its Error that
feareth Change) in some other Body. These Shells are broken away utterly
from the Star that did enlighten them, and they are Vampires, obsessing
them that adventure hemselves into the Astral World without Magical
Protection, or invoke them, as do the Spiritists. For by Death is Man
released only from the Gross Body, at the first, and is complete
otherwise upon the Astral Plane, as he was in his Life. But this
Wholeness suffereth Stress, and its Girders are loosened, the weaker
first and after that the stronger.

## {Zeta }{lambda } DE ADEPTIS R. C. ESCATOLOGIA.

Consider now in this Light what shall come to the Adept, to him that
hath aspired constantly and firmly to his Star, attuning the Mind unto
the Musick of its Will. In him, if his Mind be knit perfectly together
is itself, and conjoined with he Star, is so strong a Confection that it
breaketh away easily not only from the Gross Body, but the fine. It is
this Fine Body which bindeth it to the Astral, as did the Gross to he
Material World so then it accomplisheth willingly the Sacrament of a
second Death and leaveth the Body of Light. But the Mind, cleaveth
closely, by Right of its Harmony, and Might of its Love, to its Star,
resisteth the Ministers of Disruption, for a Season, according to its
Strength. Now, if his Star be of those that are bound by the Great Oath,
incarnating without Remission because of Delight in the Cosmic
Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle in the appointed Way, and indwelleth
the Foetus of a Child, and quickeneth it. And if at this Time the mind
of its Former Tabernacle yet cling to it, then is there Continuity
Character, and it may be Memory between the two Vehicles. This is,
briefly and without Elaboration, the Way of Asar in Amenti, according to
mine Opinion, of which I say not: This is the Truth.

## {Zeta }{mu } DE NUPTIIS SUMMIS.

Now then to this Doctrine, o my Son, add thou that which hou hast
learned in "The Book of the Law", that Death is the Dissolution in the
Kiss of Our Lady Nuith. This is a true Consonance as of Bass with Treble
for here is the Impulse that setteth us to Magick, the Pain of the
Conscious Mind. Having hen Wit to find the Cause of this Pain in the
Sense of Separation, and its Cessation by the Union of Live, it is the
Summit of our Holy Art to present the whole Being of our Star o Our Lady
in the Nuptial of our Bodily Death. We are then o make our whole Engine
the true and real Appurtenance of our Force, without Leak, or Friction,
or any other Waste or Hindrance to its Action. Thou knowest well how an
Horse, or even a Machine propelled by a Man's feet, becometh as it were
as Extension of the Rider, though his Skill and Custom. Thus let thy
Star have profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating it, and sustaining it, so
that it be healed of its Separation, and his even in Life, but most
especially in Death. Also thou oughtest to increase thy Vehicle in Mass
by true Growth in Balance, that thou be a Bridegroom comely and
wellfavoured, a Man of might, and a Warrior worthy of the Bed of so
divine a Dissolution.

## {Zeta }{nu } DE ARTE VOLUPTATE DILEMMA QUAEDAM.

There is a certain Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis concerning Will
that it should flow freely in its Way: namely hat for such as I am it is
well, because I am endowed by Nature with a Lust insatiable in any Kind,
so that the Universe itself seemeth incapable to appease it. For I have
poured myself out unceasingly, in Bodily Passion, and in Battles with
Men, and with Wild Beasts, and with Mountains and Deserts, and in Poetry
and other Writings of the Musick of mine Imagination, and in Books of
our own Mysteries, and in Works Magical, and so forth, so that in Mine
Age I am become verily a Slave to mine own Genius and my Law is that
unless I sleep or create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim the Reward
and the Recreation of my Death. But (I hear thee say it) this is not the
Case of All, or even of many Men; but their Act of Will is satisfied
easily at its first Guerdon. Should not hen their Wisdom be to resist
themselves for a Space, as Water heaped up by a Dam gathereth Force, and
Hunger feedeth upon Abstinence? Also, there is that which I have written
in a former Chapter of the right Use of Discipline; and thirdly, his
free Flowing is without Subtility of Art, as it were an Harlot that
plucketh Men by the Sleeve.

## {Zeta }{xi } DE HOC MODO DISSOLUTIO.

Here therefore will I write down the Answer to this Indictment of our
Wisdom; that every Act of Will is to be made in its Perfection, which
State is to be attained according to hese Conditions: firs, those of its
own Law; second, those of its Environment. Judge thine own Case
individually, each as it pleadeth; for there is no Cannon or Code, since
every Star hath its own Law diverse from every other. Now there is the
Restraint of Conflict which is Impotance and Disruption; the he
Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by Repose and by
Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his Armies, and feedeth them, and
looketh to their Furniture and to their Spirit, before he joineth the
Battle. Also, there is the Restraint of Art, which includeth that other
of Discipline, and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to admire its
Strength and its Beauty, and to enjoy its Victory by Anticipation in
full Confidence, not fearful of Time that robbeth them that are ignorant
concerning him, how he is but Mirage and Illusion, incapable to besiege
the Fortress of the Soul. Work hou thy Will, as I said aforetime by the
Mouth of Eliphas Levi Zahed, knowing thyself Omnipotent, and thine
Habitation Eternity. O my Son, attend well this Word, for it is an
Heirloom, and a Ring of Ruby and Emerald in thine Inheritance.

## {Zeta }{omicron } DE COMEDIA, QUAE PAN DICTUR.

Subtler than the Serpent of Hermes, o my Son, is this Way of Restraint
of Art, and thou shalt meet therein with the God Pan, and have him to
thy Playmate. So shalt thou devise Comedy and Tragedy, as it were
Settings for the Jewel of thy Will, to enhance the Beauty thereof, and
to refine thy Pleasures. This is that which is written in "The Book of
the Law": "... Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be
not animal; refine thy rapture! If thou drink, drink by the eight and
ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by delicacy; and if thou do
aught joyous, let there be subtlety herein! But exceed! exceed!" Thus
thou mayst even toy with hy tamed Devil of Sin, and use the Pain thereof
to sharpen he taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and thy Tongue keen to the
Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is opposite to his in his
Preference; or as a skilled Match of Love aboundeth in Pinchings,
Slappings, Bitings and the like, to intensify the Bout and to prolong
it. But this is Risk and Peril unless thou be wholly Master, one in thy
Will; for there is Poison in these dead Snakes, to destroy thee if thou
lend hem of thy Life by so little as one Doubt of thyself, as a Seed of
Division.

## {Zeta }{pi } DE LUDO AMORIS.

In this Mystery of the Restraint of Art is also the Secret of Illusion.
Why, sayest thou, hath not Our Lady Nuith her Will of Her Lord Hadith,
and He of Her, and so all ended? But his is the Play of Her Love, that
She veileth Her Beauty in he Robe of Illusion many-coloured, and evadeth
Him in Sport, yea, and divorceth Him from the Embrace, weaving new
Modesties and allurements in Her Dance. Now, o my Son, the full
Comprehension of this Arcanum is the Fruit of Contemplation, if this be
prepared by the Experience of this Art in thine own Case. But to them
that understand not, and have Grief and Separation, being deceived by
this Play so that they deem it he Division of Hate, She can but speak in
Simplicity by that Word written in "The Book of the Law": "To me!" For
until thou love, the Play of Love is but Emptiness; and its cruelty is
Cruelty indeed, except thou know it to be but a Sauce to wet Appetite,
and to give Emphasis of Contrast, as a Painter dimmeth the Light by
Cunning of his Shadows. But all this Delight that thou mayst have of the
Universe both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is a Reward of thine
Attainment of Truth, and followeth after it. Nor canst thou comprehend
this Doctrine by Mind, for the Division in thee crieth aloud in its
Agony, denying it, unless thou be wholly Initiate.

## {Zeta }{koppa } DE GAUDIO STUPRI.

O my Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but Misunderstanding of
the Art of Love of Our Lady Nuith. Yea, verily, it is all a Trick of Her
Wit, and a Device of Her Delight, that Sin should appear, and also (Mark
thou well!) he Misapprehension of its Nature. Therefore the Pain of any
Sinner in his Division and His Separation is to Her a little Spasm of
Pleasure. But as for him, let him apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolve
himself in Her Love. Thou then, being Initiate and Illuminated in this
Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow, or rather that of thy Vehicle, as
Lackey to the Joy hat thou hast in thy True Self, the Star among the
Stars of Her Body. The Adept of our Art is not compassionate concerning
Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unless the Healing thereof were
proper to his Will, for he is aware of he whole Truth of the Matter. So
goeth he upon his Way, and ighteneth not a Rein upon the Horses of the
Universe, but is content, beholding the Speed of their Course. Verily, o
my Son, it is well written in the Book of the Magus that it is he Curse
of my Grade that I must needs preach my Law unto Men. For I am afflicted
in my Tabernacle on this Count, but in my Self, I rejoice, and join in
the Laughter of Her love.

## {Zeta }{rho } DE CAECITIA PHILOSOPHORUM ANTIQUORUM.

Behold, how comfortable is this thy Wisdom, wherein I have resolved
every Conflict soever that is or that can be, even in all dimensions,
that Antagonism of Things no less than their Limitations. I have said:
Evil be thou my Good; for it is the Magical Mirror of Our Astarte and
the Caduceus of our Hermes. Now this was the Error of Elder
Philosophers, that perceiving Changeful Duality as the Cause of Sorrow,
they sought the Reconcilement in Unity and in Stability. But I shew thee
the Universe as the Body of Our Lady Nuith, who is None and Two, with
Hadith Her Lord as the Alternator of those Phases. This Universe is then
a perpetual By-coming, the Vessel of every Permutation of infinity,
wherein every Phenomenon is a Sacrament, Change being the act of Love,
and Duality the Condition prodromal to that Act even as an Axe must be
taken back from a Cedar that it may deliver its Stroke. The Error
herefore of thee Philosophers lay in their false Assumption hat Bliss,
Knowledge and Being (the Qualities of their Changeless Unity) could be
States. O my Son, how pitiful is heir Beggary, these Paupers of Sense
and of Experience and of Observation! The Emptiness of their Bellies was
it that bred Phantoms of Ideal, so that they sought Joy by a crude
Denial of what Truth (or rather, Fact) they had perceived concerning he
Universe, so that they set up an Idol of Death for their God, in very
Rage of Hatred against the Sum of their own Selves.

## {Zeta }{sigma } DE HERESIA MANICHAEA.

These Philosophers, or shall I not say Misosophers and Pseudo-Sophists,
have been hard put to it to explain the Mystery of the Existence of
their Evil. They have cried, frothing with Words, the Evil is Illusion.
But if so, that Illusion is Evil, whence came it, and to what End? If
their Devil created it, who created that Devil? All their contention
resolveth to this Dilemma of Change in a Changeless, Falsity in a True,
Hate in a Loving, Weakness in an Almighty, Duality in a Simple, Being as
they define their God. Nor do they see that they restrict their God
(whom yet hey would have to be All) by admitting Opposites to this
Nature, ever when they sum these Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion
is the Denial of His Truth. But the Indians, seeing his, seek Escape by
denying all Duality soever to their God, or True State, I speak of
Parabrahaman and of Nibbana, thus in any Reality of Thought rather
denying Him or It than destroying Illusion. But in our Light we have no
Need of any Denial, and accept all, yea Illusion itself, discriminating
only in our Minds between Phenomena by Comparison with some convenient
Standard, for the Purpose of maintaining the Order of our Conceptions in
Respect of the Relation of any Being with its Environment.

## {Zeta }{tau } DE VERITATE RERUM.

So do thou apprehend this Wisdom, o my Son, laying it to hine Heart, as
a Mistress, and hiding it in the Treasury of hy Mind as a Jewel of
Enlightenment. Consider a Dream, how it is unreal in Respect of thine
Experience of the Objects of hy Waking Sense, but real also, both as it
did in Fact impress thy Mind, and as it did express some Hunger of thy
Secret Nature, as I have already shewed in this Letter. Consider the
Play of the Chess, how its Law hath made for itself a Language and a
Literature, yet it is but an arbitrary invention; without impinging
(save as it operateth though Pleasure and interest upon Minds) on any
other Sphere soever of the Universe. Equally, Things called (vulgarly)
Real and Material exist in the Universe of our Consciousness only by he
Apprehension of their Images in mind through Sense; as, how is Colour
Real or Material to a blind may or a Law mathematical true to a man that
is imbecile or demented? All hings therefore exist in one form or
another; but the Reality of any, though in itself absolute, is in regard
of its Relation with any other thing dependent upon the Intercourse and
Language between them, conscious or unconscious. Consider Azote, that
hath nigh Four Parts in Five of the Air, how it is not real to the
Perception of any human Sense, but yet most real to our Lungs, diluting
the Oxygen, by whose Love we were else violently combust.

## {Zeta }{upsilon } DE APHORISMO UBI DICO: OMNIA SUNT.

My son, long did I await thee, yearning, and with Price and Great
Gladness did I bid thee Welcome to my City of the Pyramids, under the
Night of Pan. Now then in my dear Love of hee will I reveal this Secret
of Wisdom which I wrote occultly in my last Chapter, in these Words: All
Things Exist. Considered by right Understanding, this is to deny hat
there is anything imaginable or unimaginable which doth not exist. That
is, the Body of Our Lady Nuith hath no Limit, and there is no void that
She filleth not with the Variety and Beauty of Her Stars in Her Space.
Nor is there any one Law of her Nature, but in Her are all Laws, so that
each Thing or each Truth that thou perceiveth is as it were one Gesture
of Her Dance. Shut up the Book of thy Questions, o my Son, concerning
nature, Her Way, Her Origin, or Her Purpose, except in those Matters
which concern thee and thine own Orbit, o hou Star, begotten of my Loins
in my Lust of Hilarion, the Golden Rose, mystic and Joyous, the Lily of
a Thousand Petals and One Petal, subtle and perverse, that thou mightest
fulfil his Work of a Magus which I cam to accomplish, robing myself in
Flesh of man, as was my Nature and the Will of my Nature, he Name of my
Star that flameth in the Body of Nuith our Lady.

## {Zeta }{phi } DE RATIONE HUJUS EPISTOLAE SCRIBENDAE.

Behold, I draw unto the End of this Discourse of Wisdom, as a Ship that
hath adventured upon Ocean, from whose mast the Watcher espieth in the
Dimness of the Horizon a Point of Snow, being the Peak of a great
Mountain that is Guardian of the Harbour, the Term of that Voyage. So
now do I commit thee wholly unto thyself, for I exist not in thine
Universe, save in my Relation with thee, wherefore this Part of me is in
Truth thou rather than I. Yet do thou treasure this Letter, for it is
mine especial Gift, and hath Radiance of the Light of my Wisdom, and
flameth, being the Blood of my Love of thee and of Mankind. Also, it is
the Word of my Will, the Charter of the Liberty of my Soul, and thine,
and that of every Man, and every Woman; for we are Stars, O my Son, for
many Days was I silent, until thou wast fearful lest thou hadst, by
Ignorance or by Inadvertance, enkindled the Fire of my Wrath. But I
spake not, because I knew in my Wisdom that thou must pass a certain
Ordeal of thine Initiation by thine own Virtue. For this Cause I held
aloof; but in my Love I made a Beginning of this Letter, beholding thy
triumph beforehand; and with Prescience, divining thy next Need, that is
to say, this Book of the Words of my Wisdom.

## {Zeta }{chi } DE NATURA HUJUS EPISTOLAE.

O my Son, in this Letter have I written the Name of my own Nature, its
Law, its Quality, its Will and its Appurtenance or Ornament. For it is
the Child of my Love toward thee, and the Expression through mine Art of
my Will so far as that regardeth thee. Now every Child is made of the
Essence of his Father, so that every Creation is a Likeness or image of
the Creator, but modified by the Mother, that is to say, the Material
whereon he begetteth it. So then this Letter is a Projection of mine own
Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in hy Regard; and it shall be unto
thee as a clear Vision of thy Father, and of the Word of the Aeon that
he hath uttered unto Man. But also, because this Word is the Formula of
the Aeon, hat is the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, the Equation that
expresseth its Energy and its Motion, it shall serve every Man in his
Measure as a Text-Book or Comment upon the Theorick and Praxis of
Magick. By it may he discover his true Nature, and its Will, and apply
his Force and his Intelligence to the right Fulfilment thereof. It shall
be a beacon to enlighten him, to comfort him, and to direct him; and it
shall be a Witness and Memorial of my Word and of my Work, as of mine
Attainment unto Wisdom.

## {Zeta }{psi } DE MODO QUO HAEC EPISTOLAM SCRIPSI.

There is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ with mine own Hand
and Style, slowly and heedfully (as is contrary with my custom) being
the Fruit of the Tree of my Mediation, well-ripened by the Sun of mine
Illumination. With much Toil have I done this, being oftentimes seated
without Motion save of the Hands, while Earth rolled from Twilight unto
Twilight, so that my Body became cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse.
Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, have I been given to
Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably the Mass of he Holy
Ghost, in the Concentration of my Will to impart this Wisdom unto thee,
and to reveal the Mysteries of Truth. Now of all these this is the Root,
that Truth is not fixed with he Rigour of Death, but vital with Lust of
Change, and enflamed with the Love of its opposite. Thus even Falsehood
is not alien to Truth, for the Perfection of Nature comprehendeth all.
But all these Things are written in "The Book of the Law", after which
do I limp painfully; afar off, upon the poor Crutch of mine
Understanding of its Word; yea, I am well assured that in that Book are
writ all Things soever; but we, being mostly without Wit are not able to
distinguish hem. For the Stature of Aiwass is beyond our Measure, seeing
hat he was able to comprehend the whole Mystery of Nuith and of Hadith,
and yet to declare Their Message in the Language of Man.

## {Zeta }{omega } DE SAPIENTIA ET STULTITIA.

O my Son, in this the Colophon of my Epistle will I recall he Title and
Superscription thereof; that is, "The Book of Wisdom or Folly". I
proclaim Blessing and Worship to Nuith Our Lady and Her Lord Hadith, for
the Miracle of the Anatomy of he Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as it is shewn in
the Design Minutum Mundum, the Tree of Life. For though Wisdom be the
Second Emanation of his Essence, there is a Path to separate and to join
them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that is One indeed, but also an
Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthography; to signify the Most Holy
Trinity, and by Metathesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death. This
is also the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the Root-Sound of OMNE,
or, in Greek, PAN, and it is a Number of the Sun. Yet is the Atu of
Thoth that correspondeth thereunto marked with ZERO, and its Name is
MAT, whereof I have spoken formerly, and its Image is the Fool. O my
Son, gather thou all these Limbs ogether in One Body, and breathe upon
it with thy Spirit, hat it may live; then do thou embrace it with Lust
of they Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it; so shall ye be One
Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and Ecstasy of this Consummation
thou shalt with by what Inspiration thou didst choose thy Name in the
Gnosis, I mean PARZIVAL, "der reine Thor", the True Knight that won
Kingship in Monsalvat, and made whole the Wound of Amfortas, and ordered
Kundry to right Service, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle
of he Sangral; yea also upon himself did he accomplish his Work in the
End: "Hochsten Heiles Wunder! Erlosung dem Erloser !" This is the last
Word of the Song that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for Worship of
this Mystery. Understand thou this, o my son, as I ake leave of thee in
this Epistle, that the Summit of Wisdom is the opening of the Way that
leadeth unto theCrown and Essence of all, to the Soul of the Child
Horus, the Lord of he Aeon. This Way is the Path of the Pure Fool.
Amoun.

And who is this Pure Fool? Lo, in the Sagas of Old Time, Legend of
Scald, of Brad, of Druid, cometh He not in Green Like Spring? O thou
Great Fool, thou Water that art Air, in whom all Complex is resolved!
Yes, thou in ragged Raiment, with the Staff of Priapus and the Wineskin!
thou standest up on the Crocodile, like Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat
leapeth upon thee! Yea, and more also I have known Thee who Thou art,
Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy Name **IAO** ! Now at the End of
all do I come to the Being of Thee, beyond By-coming, and I cry aloud my
Word, as it was given unto Man by thine Uncle Alcofribas Masior, the
Oracle of the Bottle of BACBUC, and this Word is **TRINC**.

*Love is the law, love under will.*
