------------------------------------------------------------------------

Facing East, in the centre, draw deep deep deep thy breath closing thy
mouth with thy right forefinger prest against thy lower lip. Then
dashing down the hand with a great sweep back and out, expelling
forcibly thy breath, cry APO PANTOS KAKODAIMONOS. With the same
forefinger touch thy forehead, and say SOI, thy member, and say O
PHALLE, \[The secret sense of these words is to be sought in the
numeration thereof.\], thy right shoulder, and say ISCHUROS, thy left
shoulder, and say EUCHARISTOS; then clasp thine hands, locking the
fingers, and cry IAÕ. Advance to the East. Imagine strongly a Pentagram,
aright, in thy forehead. Drawing the hands to the eyes, fling it forth,
making the sign of Horus and roar THÉRION. Retire thine hand in the sign
of Hoor-paar-Kraat.

Go round to the North and repeat; but say NUIT.

Go round to the West and repeat; but whisper BABALON.

Go round to the South and repeat; but bellow HADIT.

Completing the circle widdershins, retire to the centre and raise thy
voice in the Paian, with these words IÕ PAN, with the signs of N.O.X.

Extend the arms in the form of a Tau and say low but clear:  
PRO MOU IUNGES OPICHÕ MOU TELETARCHAI EPI DEXIA CHUNOCHES EPARISTERA
DAIMONOS PHEG EI GAR PERI MOU O ASTÉR TÕN PENTE KAI EN TÉI STÉLÉI Õ
ASTÉR TÕN EX ESTÉXE.

Repeat the Cross Qabalistic, as above, and end as thou didst begin.
