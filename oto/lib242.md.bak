## Publication in Class C

  

# Aha!

The Sevenfold Mystery of the Ineffable Love; the Coming of the Lord in
the Air as King and Judge of this corrupted World;

Wherein

Under the form of a Discourse between Marsyas an Adept and Olympas his
Pupil the Whole Secret of the Way of Initiation is laid open from the
Beginning to the End; for the Instruction of the Little Children of the
Light.

Written in Trembling and Humility for the Brethren of the A.'. A.'. by
Their very dutiful Servant, an Aspirant to their Sublime Order,

Aleister Crowley

## THE ARGUMENTATION

A LITTLE before Dawn, the pupil comes to greet his Master, and begs
instruction.

Inspired by his Angel, he demands the Doctrine of being rapt away into
the Knowledge and Conversation of Him.

The Master discloses the doctrine of Passive Attention or Waiting.

This seeming hard to the Pupil, it is explained further, and the Method
of Resignation, Constancy, and Patience inculcated. The Paradox of
Equilibrium. The necessity of giving oneself wholly up the the new
element. Egoism rebuked.

The Master, to illustrate this Destruction of the Ego, describes the
Visions of Dhyana.

He further describes the defence of the Soul against assailing Thoughts,
and shows that the duality of Consciousness is a blasphemy against the
Unity of God; so that even the thought called God is a denial of
God-as-He-is-in-Himself.

The pupil sees nothing but a blank midnight in this Emptying of the
Soul. He is shown that this is the necessary condition of Illumination.
Distinction is further made between these three Dhyanas, and those early
visions in which things appear as objective. With these three Dhyanas,
moreover, are Four other of the Four Elements: and many more.

Above these is the Veil of Paroketh. Its guardians.

The Rosy Cross lies beyond this veil, and therewith the vision called
Vishvarupadarshana. Moreover, there is the Knowledge and Conversation of
the Holy Guardian Angel.

The infinite number and variety of these Visions.

The impossibility of revealing all these truths to the outer and
uninitiated world.

The Vision of the Universal Peacock--Atmadarshana. The confusion of the
Mind, and the Perception of its self-contradiction.

The Second Veil--the Veil of the Abyss.

The fatuity of Speech.

A discussion as to the means by which the vision arises in the pure Soul
is useless; suffice it that in the impure Soul no Vision will arise. The
practical course is therefore to cleanse the Soul.

The four powers of the Sphinx; even adepts hardly attain to one of them!

The final Destruction of the Ego.

The Master confesses that he has lured the disciple by the promise of
Joy, as the only thing comprehensible by him, although pain and joy are
transcended even in early visions.

Ananda (bliss)--and its opposite--mark the first steps of the path.
Ultimately all things are transcended; and even so, this attainment of
Peace is but as a scaffolding to the Palace of the King.

The sheaths of the soul. The abandonment of all is necessary; the adept
recalls his own tortures, as all that he loved was torn away.

The Ordeal of the Veil of the Abyss; the Unbinding of the Fabric of
Mind, and its ruin.

The distinction between philosoÿhical credence and interior certitude.

Sammasati--the trance wherein the adept perceives his causal connection
with the Universe; past, present, and future.

Mastering the Reason, he becomes as a little child, and invokes his Holy
Guardian Angel, the Augoeides.

Atmadarshana arising is destroyed by the Opening of the Eye of Shiva;
the annihilation of the Universe. The adept is destroyed, and there
arises the Master of the Temple.

The pupil, struck with awe, proclaims his devotion to the Master;
whereat the latter bids him rather unite himself with the Augoeides.

Yet, following the great annihilation, the adept reappears as an Angel
to instruct men in this doctrine.

The Majesty of the Master described.

The pupil, wonder-struck, swears to attain, and asks for further
instruction.

The Master describes the Eight Limbs of Yoga.

The pupil lamenting the difficulty of attainment, the Master shows forth
the sweetness of the hermit's life.

One doubt remains: will not the world be able instantly to recognise the
Saint? The Master replies that only imperfect Saints reveal themselves
as such. Of these are the cranks and charlatans, and those that fear and
deny Life. But let us fix our thoughts on Love, and not on the failings
of others!

The Master invokes the Augoeides; the pupil through sympathy is almost
rapt away.

The Augoeides hath given the Master a message; namely, to manifest the
New Way of the Equinox of Horus, as revealed in Liber Legis.

He does so, and reconciles it with the Old Way by inviting the Test of
Experiment. They would go therefore to the Desert or the Mountains--nay!
here and now shall it be accomplished.

Peace to all beings!

Hail! ye twin warriors that guard<br />
The pillars of the world! Your time<br />

Heaven with his inexhaustible slime<br />
Is slain; I bear the Wand of Power,<br />
The Wand that waxes and that wanes;<br />

In my left hand; and naught remains!<br />

Hidden and glorious, a flame<br />
Secretly shooting from the sun.<br />

The Queen of Space; and subtly She<br />
Shall bend from Her infinity<br />
Like a lambent flame of blue,<br />
Touching us, and piercing through<br />
All the sense-webs that we are<br />
As the aethyr penetrates a star!<br />
Her hands caressing the black earth,<br />
Her sweet lithe body arched for love,<br />
Her feet a Zephyr to the flowers,<br />

That she is mine, supremely mine,<br />
And clinging to the infinite girth<br />
My soul gets perfect joy thereof<br />
Beyond the abysses and the hours;<br />
So that--I kiss her lovely brows;<br />
She bathes my body in perfume<br />
Of sweat .... O thou my secret spouse,<br />
Continuous One of Heaven! illume<br />
My soul with this arcane delight,<br />
Volumptuous Daughter of the Night!<br />

Changing that rosy smoke of light<br />
To a pure crystalline white;<br />
Though the mist of mind, as draws<br />
A dancer round her limbs the gauze,<br />
Clothe Light, and show the virgin Sun<br />
A lemon-pale medallion!<br />
Thence leap we leashless to the goal,<br />
Stainless star-rapture of the soul.<br />
So the altar-fires fade<br />
As the Godhead is displayed.<br />
Nay, we stir not. Everywhere<br />
