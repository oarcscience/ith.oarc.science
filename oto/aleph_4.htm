  DE MANU QUAE MAGUM SUSTINET.</h2>
<p>Now it may be well that such Periods of Recuperation are necessary to such 
  souls as mine; and so no Ill. But I fell from my Will, and sought other Ends 
  in Life; and so the Hand came upon me, and tore away that which I desired, as 
  thou knowest; also it is written in the Temple of Solomon the King. Yet consider 
  also these two Years as a necessary Preparation for that greatest of all Events 
  which befell me in El-Kahira, in the Land of Khem, the Choice of me as the Word 
  of the Aeon. Now then for a while I worked with my Will, though not wholly; 
  and again the Hand reached forth and smote me. This, albeit my Slackness was 
  but as a Boy playing Truant, not a revolt against my Self. Wherefore, despite 
  all, I made much Progress in short Time.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{beta }<br>
  DE SUO PECCATO.</h2>
<p>Now then, well schooled, I strove no more against my Nature, and worked with 
  all my Will. Thou knowest well how greatly I was rewarded. Yet in this last 
  Initiation to the Grade of Magus, wherein three-and-seventy Days, as Men count 
  Days, is but One Day, the Ordeal grew so fierce and intolerable that I gave 
  back a Step. I did not utterly renounce the Work, but I swore not to continue 
  unless mine Agony were abated. But after fifteen Days, I came to myself in a 
  certain Ordeal, wherein I knew myself finally, that I could do no other than 
  take up that fearful Burden that had broken my Spirit. And for these fifteen 
  Days have I not suffered infinite Things? Was not the Tree of my Work frozen, 
  one Branch withered, and on blasted? Look no more, o my son, upon thy Father's 
  Shame!</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{gamma }<br>
  DE SUA VICTORIA PER NOMEN <strong>BABALON</strong>.</h2>
<p>And after? This Dawn (for I have toiled through the Night in my great Love 
  and Care of thee) how is it with me? it is well. For I have found myself; I 
  have found my Will; the Obstacles that daunted me are seen to be by the Shadows 
  of Shadows. Grace be unto Lady BABALON.</p>
<p>Thus it is written in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;: &quot;Remember all ye 
  that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as shadows; they pass 
  &amp; are done; but there is that which remains.&quot;</p>
<p>Learn then that it is in the contemplation of Division that Sorrow is, for 
  Division is the Formula of Choronzon. It is herefore discreet for thee to unite 
  each element of Sorrow with its Opposite; in whose Triumph of Hymen is Ekstacy, 
  until by Apprehension of the new great Opposite the Idea is again seen as Sorrow. 
  This then is the Issue from Sorrow; and thou mayst understand that I now also 
  am confident in the Necessity of this my Fall to prepare the formula of my Exaltation. 
  Therefore, my Son, thus Hail Me: Blessing and worship to the Beast, the Prophet 
  of the Lovely Star.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{delta }<br>
  DE ARCANO NEFANDO.</h2>
<p>O my Son, learn this concerning Magick, that the Yang moveth, and thus giveth 
  itself up Eternally; but the Yin moveth not, seeking ever to enclose or restrict, 
  reproducing in its own likeness what Impressions soever it made thereon, yet 
  without Surrender. Now the Tao absorbeth all without Reproduction; so then let 
  the Yang turn thereto, and not unto he Yin. And that thou mayst understand this, 
  I say: It is a Mystery of O.T.O. For the Sun ariseth not and entereth to strike 
  upon the High Altar of the Minster by the Great Western Gates, but by the Rose 
  Oriel doth he make Way and Progress in His Pageant. O my Son, the Doors of Silver 
  are wide open, and hey tempt thee with their Beauty: but by the narrow Portal 
  of Pure Gold shalt thou come nobly to thy Sanctuary. Behold! Thou knowest not 
  how perfect is this Magick; it is the dearest-bought and holiest of our Arcana. 
  What then is like unto my Love toward Thee, that bestoweth upon thee this Treasure 
  of my Wisdom? My Son, neglect it not; for it is the Exorcism of Exorcisms, and 
  the Enchantment of Enchantments.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{epsilon }<br>
  DE ARCANO, PER QUOD SPIRITUS QUIDAM IN CORPORE RECIPIATUR.</h2>
<p>Here now is another Formula of Power, good to invoke any Being to manifest 
  in thyself. First, invoke him by the Power of all thy Spells and conjurations, 
  with Mind concentrated and Will vehement, toward him, as I have written in many 
  Books. But because thou are NEMO, thou mayst safely invoke him, no matter of 
  what Nature, within thy Circle. Now then do thou confer on him as a Guerdon 
  of his Obedience the Dignity of a Soul seeking Incarnation, and so precede to 
  consecrate thine Act by performing the Mass of the Holy Ghost. Then shall that 
  Spirit make himself Body from those Elements, and thou partaking thereof makest 
  thine own Body his Machinery of Manifestation, and thus mayst thou work with 
  any Spirit soever; yet this shall serve thee most in common Life. Also he Qualities 
  are well defined in the Cards of the Tarot, so hat thou hast a clear-cut Means 
  of developing thy Powers according to the Needs of the Time. But learn also 
  this, to work constantly under the Guidance of thine Holy Guardian Angel, so 
  that thy Workings be alway in Harmony and Accord with thy true Will.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{digamma }<br>
  DE CLAVE KABBALISTICA HUJUS ARTIS.</h2>
<p>Now then to thee who art long since Master of High Magick, it will be easy 
  to shew how the Mass of the Holy Ghost, sung even in Ignorance, may work many 
  a Wonder by Virtue of the Force generated being compelled to manifest on other 
  than its own Plane. Here then is a Theory of the Mystery of the Aeon, hat I, 
  being the Logos appointed thereunto, did create an Image of my little Universe 
  in the Mind of the Woman of Scarlet; that is, I manifested my whole Magical 
  Self in her Mind. Thus then in Her, as in a Mirror, have I been able to interpret 
  myself to myself. Thou also in thine own Way hast he Power to create such an 
  Image; but be thou sure and alert, esting constantly the Persons in that Image 
  by the Holy Qabalah and by the true Signs of Brotherhood. For each Person herein 
  shall be a Part of thyself, made individual and perfect, able to instruct thee 
  in thy Path. Yet often there shall be others, that are to aid thee in thy Working, 
  or to oppose it. And in this Matter thou shalt read especially the Record of 
  thy Father His Workings with Soror Ahita (blessed be Her Name unto the Ages) 
  and certain others to Boot.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{zeta }<br>
  DE MISSA SPIRITUS SANCTI.</h2>
<p>Now at last, o my son, may I being thee to understand the Truth of this Formula 
  that is hidden in the Mass of the Holy Ghost. For Horus that is Lord of the 
  Aeon is the Child crowned and conquering. The formula of Osiris was, as thou 
  knowest, a Word of Death, that is, the Force lay long in Darkness, and by Putrifaction 
  came to Resurrection. But we ake living Things, and pour in Life and Nature 
  of our own Will, so that instantly and without Corruption the Child (as it were 
  the Word of that Will) is generated; and again immediately taketh up his Habitation 
  among us to manifest in Force and Fire. This Mass of the Holy Ghost is then 
  the true Formula of the Magick of the Aeon of Horus, blessed by He in His Name 
  Ra-Hoor-Khuit! And thou shalt bless also the Name of our Father Merlin, Frater 
  Superior of the O.T.O., for that by seven Years of Apprenticeship in His School 
  did I discover his most excellent Way of Magick. Be thou diligent, o my son, 
  for in this wondrous Art is no more Toil, Sorrow, and Disappointment, as it 
  was in the dead Aeon of the Slain Gods.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{eta }<br>
  DE FORMULA TOTA.</h2>
<p>Here then is the Schedule for all the Operations of Magick. First, thou shalt 
  discover thy true Will, as I have already aught thee, and that Bud thereof which 
  is the Purpose of this Operation.</p>
<p>Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or constructing it, and 
  naming it according to thine Holy Qabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth. 
  Third, purify and consecrate this Person, concentrating upon him and against 
  all else. This Preparation shall continue in all thy daily Life. Mark well, 
  make ready a new Child immediately after every Birth. Fourth, make an especial 
  and direct Invocation at thy Mass, before the Introit, formulating a visible 
  Image of this Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation. Fifth, perform he 
  Mass, not omitting the Epiklesis, and let there be a Golden Wedding Ring at 
  the Marriage of thy Lion with thine Eagle. Sixth, at the Consumption of the 
  Eucharist accept this Child, losing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well 
  assimilated with thee. Now then do this continuously, for by Repetition cometh 
  forth both Strength and Skill, and the Effect is cumulative, if thou allow no 
  Time to dissipate itself.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{theta }<br>
  DE HAC FORMULA CONSIDERATIONES KABBALISTICAE.</h2>
<p>Behold moreover, my Son, the Oeconomy of this Way, how it is according to the 
  Tao, fulfilling itself wholly within thine own Sphere. And it is utterly in 
  Tune with thine own Will on every Plane, so that every Part of thy Nature rejoiceth 
  with every other Part, communicating Praise. Now then learn also how this Formula 
  is that of the Word <strong>ABRAHADABRA</strong>. First, HAD is the Triangle 
  erect upon twin Squares. Of Hadit need I not o write, for He hath hidden Himself 
  in &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. This Substance is the Father, the Instrument 
  is the Son, and he Metaphysical Ekstacy is the Holy Ghost, whose Name is HRILIU. 
  These are then the Sun, Mercury, and Venus, whose sacred letters are R ({HB:Resh 
  }), B ({HB:Bet }), and D ({HB:Dalet }). But the last of the Diverse Letters 
  is H ({HB:Heh }), which in the Tarot is the Star whose Eidolon is D ({HB:Dalet 
  }); and herein is that Arcanum concerning the Tao of which I have already written. 
  Of this will I not write more plainly. But mark this, that our Trinity is our 
  Path inwards in the Solar System, and that H being of our Lady Nuith starry, 
  is an Anchor to this Magick which else were apt to deny our wholeness of Relation 
  to the Outer as to the Inner. My son, ponder these Words, and profit by them; 
  for I have wrought cunningly to conceal or to reveal, according to thine Intelligence, 
  o my Son!</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{iota }<br>
  DE QUIBUSDAM ARTIBUS MAGICIS.</h2>
<p>Now of those Operations of Magick by which thou seekest to display unto some 
  other Person the Righteousness of thy Will I make haste to instruct thee. First, 
  if thou have a reasonable Link with him by Word or Letter, it is most natural 
  simply to create in thyself, as I have taught, a Child or Bud-Will, and let 
  that radiate from thee through the Channels aforesaid. But if thou have no Link, 
  the Case is otherwise and is not easy. Here thou mayst make Communication through 
  others, as it were by Relays; or thou mayst act directly upon his Aura by Magical 
  Means, such as the Projection of the Scin-Laeca. But unless he be sensitive 
  and well-attuned, thou mayst fare but ill. Yet even in this Case thou mayst 
  attain much Skill by Practice with Intelligence. In the End it is better altogether 
  to work wholly within thine own Universe, slowly and with firm Steps advancing 
  from the Centre, and dealing, one by one, with those unharmonized Parts of the 
  Not-Self which lie close to thee. This therefore closeth the Circle of my Speech, 
  for now I am returned to that which I spake aforetime concerning the general 
  Method of love, and thy Development by that Way.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{kappa }<br>
  DE MAGNO OPERE.</h2>
<p>But now give Ear most eagerly, thou Son of my Loins, for I will now discourse 
  unto thee of thine Own Attainment, without which all is but Idleness. Know first 
  that conscious Thought is but phenomenal, the Noise of thy Machine. Now Chemistry, 
  or Al-Chem-y meaneth the Egyptian Science, and the true Magick of Egypt hath 
  this for its Foundation. We have in our House many Substances which act directly 
  upon the Blood, and many Practices of Virtue similar, to simulate, compose, 
  purify, analyse, direct, or concentrate the Thought. Confer &quot;CCXX&quot;. 
  11, 22. But this Action is subtle and of man Modes, and dependeth heavily on 
  the Conditions of the Experiment, whereof the first is thine own Will therein. 
  Therefore I say unto thee that his is thy Work immediate and necessary, to discover 
  openly hy Will unto thyself, and to fortify and enkindle it by all One-Pointedness 
  of Thought and Action, so that thou mayst direct it inwards unto its Core, that 
  is Thyself in thy Name HADIT. For thereby is thy Will made white with Heat, 
  so that no Dross may cling to it. But this Work is the Great Work, and standeth 
  alone.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{lambda }<br>
  DE GRADIBUS AD MAGNUM OPUS.</h2>
<p>This Great Work is the Attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of thine 
  Holy Guardian Angel. In the Eight Aethyr is the Way thereof revealed. But I 
  say: prepare hyself most heartily and well for that Battle of Love by all means 
  of Magick. Make thyself puissant, wise, radiant in every System, and balance 
  thyself well in thine Universe. Then with a pure Will tempered in the thousand 
  Furnaces of thy Trials, burn up thyself within thy Self. In the Preparation 
  hou shalt have learnt how thou mayst still all Thoughts, and reach Ekstacy of 
  Trance in many Modes. But in these Marriages hy conscious Self is Bridegroom, 
  and the not-Self Bride, while in this Great Work thou givest up that conscious 
  Self as Bride to thy true Self. This Operation is then radically alien from 
  all others. And it is hard, because it is a total Reversal of the Current of 
  the Will, and a Transmutation of its Formula and Nature. Here, o my son, is 
  the One Secret of Success in this Great Work: Invoke often.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{mu }<br>
  DE FORMULA LUNAE.</h2>
<p>Thus then concerning Operations of the Tao with the Yang and the Yin is there 
  enough; for thine own Art of Beauty shall divine for thee, and devise new Heavens. 
  But in all these is he Formula of the Serpent with the Head of the Lion, and 
  all his Magick is wrought by the Radiance and Creative Force hereof. And this 
  Force leapeth continually from Plane to Plane, and breaketh forth from his Bonds, 
  so that Constraint is Labour. Now then learn that the Yin hath also a Formula 
  of Force. And the Nature of the Yin is to be still, and to encircle of limit, 
  and it is as a Mirror, reflecting diverse Images without Change in its own Kind. 
  So then it seeketh never to overlap the Barriers of its Plane; for this Reason 
  it is well to use it in Operations of a very definite and restricted Type. But 
  although it be inert, yet is it most subject to Change; for its Number is four 
  Score and one, which is the Moon; and these are ALIM, the Gods elemental before 
  H descending in their midst made them Creative. So then thou mayst use constantly 
  this Formula to rearrange Things in their own Planes; and this is a most pragmatic 
  Consideration.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{nu }<br>
  DE AQUILAE SUMKNDA.</h2>
<p>Take in this Work the Eagle all undefiled and virginal for hy Sacrament. And 
  thy Technick is the Magick of Water, so hat thine Act is of Nourishment, and 
  not of Generation. Therefore the Prime Use of this Art is to build up thine 
  own Nature. But if thou hast Skill to control the Mood of the Eagle, then mayst 
  thou work many an admirable Effect upon hine Environment. Thou knowest how great 
  is the Fame of Witch-Women (old and without Man) to cause Events, although hey 
  create nothing. It is this Straitness of the Channel which giveth Force to the 
  Stream. Beware, o my Son, lest thou cling overmuch to this Mode of Magick; for 
  it is lesser than hat Other, and if thou neglect That Other, then is thy Danger 
  fearful and imminent, for it is the Edge of the Abyss of Choronzon, where are 
  the lonely Towers of the Black Brothers. Also the Formulation of the Object 
  in the Eagle is by a Species of Intoxication, so that His Nature is of Dream 
  or Delirium, and thus there may be Illusion. For this Cause I deem it not wholly 
  unwise if thou use this Way of Magick chiefly as a Cordial; that is for the 
  Fortifying of thine own Nature.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{chi }<br>
  DE MEDICINIS SECUNDUM QUATTUOR ELEMENTA.</h2>
<p>Concerning the Use of chemical Agents, and be mindful that hou abuse them not, 
  learn that the Sacrament itself relateth o Spirit, and the Four Elements balanced 
  thereunder in its Perfection. So also thy Lion himself hath a fourfold Menstruum 
  for his Serpents. Now to Fire belong Cocaine, which fortifieth the Will, loosing 
  him from bodily Fatigue, Morphine, which purifieth the Mind, making the Thought 
  safe, and slow, and single, Heroin which partaketh as it seemeth, of he Nature 
  of these twain aforesaid albeit in Degree less notable than either of them, 
  and Alcohol, which is Food, that is, Fuel, for the whole Man. To Water, attribute 
  Hashish and Mescal, for they make Images, and they open the hidden Springs of 
  Pleasure and of Beauty. Morphine, for its Ease, hath also part in Water. Air 
  ruleth Ethyl Oxide, for it is as a Sword, dividing asunder ever Part of thee, 
  making easy the Way of Analysis, so that thou comest to learn thyself of what 
  Elements thou art compact. Lastly, of the Nature of Earth are he direct Hypnotics, 
  which operate by Repose, and restore thy Strength by laying thee as a Child 
  in the Arms of the Great Mother, I say rather of Her material and physiological 
  Vicegerent.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{omicron }<br>
  DE VIRTUTE EXPERIMENTIAE IN HOC ARTE.</h2>
<p align="center">Not Sleep, not Rest, not Contentment are of the Will of the 
  Hero, but these Things he hateth, and consenteth to enjoy them only with Same 
  of his weak Nature. But he will analyse himself without Pity, and he will do 
  all Things soever that may free and fortify his Mind and Will. Know that the 
  Technick of the Right Use of this Magick with Poisons is subtle; and since the 
  Nature of every Man differeth from that of his Fellow, there entereth Idiosyncrasy, 
  and thine Experience shall be thy Master in this Art. Heed also this Word following: 
  The Right Use of these Agents is to gain a Knowledge preliminary of thine own 
  Powers, and of High States, so that thou goest not altogether blindly and without 
  Aim in hy Quest, ignorant of the Ways of thine own inner Being. Also, thou must 
  work always for a definite End, never for Pleasure or for Relaxation, except 
  thy wilt, as a good Knight is sworn to do. And thou being Hero and Magician 
  art in Peril of abusing the fiery Agents only, not those of Earth, Air or Water; 
  because these do really work with thee in Purity, making thee wholly what thou 
  wouldst be, an Engine indefatigable, a Mind clear, calm, and concentrated, and 
  a Heart fierce aglow.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{pi }<br>
  DE SACRAMENTO VERO.</h2>
<p>But in the Sacrament of the Gnosis, which is of the Spirit, is there naught 
  hurtful, for its Elements are not only Food, but a true Incarnation and Quintessence 
  of Life, Love, and Liberty, and at its Manifestation thy Lion is consecrated 
  by pure Light of Ekstacy. Also, as this is the strongest so also it is the most 
  sensitive of all Things soever, and both proper and ready to take Impress of 
  Will, not as a Seal passively but with true Recreation in a Microcosm thereof. 
  And this is a God alive and puissant to create, and He is a Word of Magick wherein 
  thou mayst read Thyself with all thine History and all hy Possibility. Also 
  as to thine Eagle, is not this chosen by Nature Herself by Her Way of Attraction, 
  without which harmony Aesthetic and Magnetic thy Lion is silent, and inert, 
  even as Achilles before his Rage in his Tent. Now also herefore I charge thee, 
  o my Son, to partake constantly of his Sacrament for it is proper to all Virtue, 
  and as thou dost learn to us it in Perfection, thou wilt surpass all other Modes 
  of Magick. Yea, in good Sooth, no Herb or Potion is like unto this, supreme 
  in every Case, for it is the True Stone of Philosophers, and the Elixir and 
  Medicine of all Things, the Universal Tincture or Menstruum of thine own Will.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{koppa }<br>
  DE DISCIPULIS REGENDIS.</h2>
<p>I will have thee to know, moreover, my dear Son, the right Art of Conduct with 
  them whom I shall give thee for Initiation. And the Rule thereof is one Rule; 
  Do that thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. See thou constantly to it hat 
  this be not broken; especially in the Section thereof (if I dare say so) which 
  readeth Mind thine own Business. This is of Application equally to all, and 
  the most dangerous Man (or Woman, as has occurred, or I err) is the Busy-body. 
  Oh how ashamed are we, and moved to Indignation, seeing the Sins and Follies 
  of our Neighbours! Of all the Occasions of this Grievance the most common is 
  the Desire of Sex unsatisfied; and thou knowest already, even in thy young Experience, 
  how in hat Delirium the Weal of the Whole Universe appeareth of no Account. 
  Do thou wean thy Babes from that Simplicity, and instil the Sense of true Proportion. 
  For verily this is a Way of Madness, Love, unless it be under Will. And the 
  Cure of his Madness is not so good as its Prevention, so that thou shouldst 
  be beforehand with these Children, shewing them the right Importance of Love, 
  how it should be a sacred Rite, exalted above Personality, and a Fire to enlighten 
  and serve Man, not to devour him.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{rho }<br>
  DE QUIBUSDAM MORBIS DISCIPULORUM.</h2>
<p>And thus, if any Babe of thine be ill at ease, look closely first whether this 
  Love be not the Root of his Distemper. Watch also Idleness, for whoso presseth 
  eagerly forward in Will heedeth little the Affairs of this Fellows. O my Son, 
  if every Man doth his own Will, there is no more to Say! But the Busy-body nor 
  mindeth his own Business, nor leaveth others to mind theirs. Be thou instant 
  therefore with such an one, to cure him by enlightening his Will, and speeding 
  him therein. Remember also that if one speak ill of another, the Fault is first 
  of all in himself, for we know naught but that which is within us. Did not the 
  great Witch-Finder end by confessing hat he also was a Sorcerer? We become that 
  which obsesseth us, either through extreme Hate or Extreme Love. Knowest thou 
  not how the one is a Symbol of the other? For this Reason, since Love is the 
  Formula of Life, we are under Bond to assimilate (in the End) that which we 
  fear or hate. So then we shall be wise to mould all Things within ourselves 
  in Quietness and Modulation. But above all must we use all to our own End, adapting 
  with Adroitness even our Weakness to the Work.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{sigma }<br>
  DE CULPIS DOMI PETENDIS.</h2>
<p>Therefore, watch heedfully the Fault of another, that thou mayst correct it 
  in thyself. For if it were not in thee, thou couldst not perceive it or understand 
  it. Lo, in thine Ekstacy of Love, thou callest upon the Universe to bear Witness 
  that to this End alone was it created; it is unthinkable that thou shouldst 
  love another, and incomprehensible that any Man should grieve. Yet ere the Moon 
  change her Quarter, thou art free of thy Lunes, and lovest another, and it may 
  be grievest in thyself while he that amazed thee hath joined the Company of 
  the Rejoicing. Watch hen, and heed thyself; and pay no Heed to thy Fellows, 
  insofar as they impede thee not. And let this be the Rule. For every Will is 
  pure and every Orbit free; but Error bringeth Confusion. See therefore that 
  none leave his Path, lest he foul that of his Brother; and remember also that 
  with Speed cometh Ease of Control. Let each Man therefore urge briskly his Chariot 
  in a right Line toward the Centre; for two Radii cannot cross. And beware most 
  of this Love, because it lieth so close to Will that Dis-ease thereof easily 
  imparteth his Error to the Whole Way of the Magician.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{tau }<br>
  DE CORPORE UMBRA HOMINIS.</h2>
<p>Concerning the Aeon, o my Son, learn that the Sun and His Vicegerent are in 
  all Aeons, of Necessity, Father, Centre, Creator, each in His Sphere of Operation. 
  But the Formula of he past Aeon was of the Dying god, and was based upon Ignorance. 
  For Men thought that the Sun died and was reborn alike in the Day and in the 
  Year; and so also was the Mystery of Man. Now already are we well assured by 
  Science how the Death of the Sun is in Truth but the Shifting of a Shadow; and 
  in this Aeon (o my son, I lift up my Voice and I make Prophecy!) so shall it 
  be proven as to Death. For the Body of Man is but his Shadow, it cometh and 
  goeth even as the tides of Ocean; and he only is in Darkness who is hidden by 
  that Shadow from the Light of his true Self. Now therefore understand thou the 
  Formula of Horus, the Lion God, the Child crowned and conquering that cometh 
  forth in Force and Fire! For thy Changes are not Phases of thee, but of the 
  Phantoms which thou mistakest for thy Self.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{upsilon }<br>
  DE SIRENIS.</h2>
<p>Concerning the Love of women, o my Son, it is written in &quot;The Book of 
  the Law&quot; that all is Freedom, if it be done unto our Lady Nuit. Yet also 
  there is this Consideration,that for every Parsifal there is a Kundry. Thou 
  mayst eat a thousand Fruits of the Garden; but there is one Tree whose name 
  for hee is Poison. In every great Initiation is an Ordeal, wherein appeareth 
  a Siren or Vampire appointed to destroy the Candidate. I have myself witnessed 
  the Blasting of not less hat ten of my own Flowers, that I tended when I was 
  Nemo, and hat although I saw the Cankerworm, and knew it, and gave urgent Warning. 
  How then consider deeply in thyself if I were rightly governed in this Action, 
  according to the Tao. For we hat are Magicians work without Fear or Haste, being 
  omnipotent in Eternity, and each Star must go his Way; and who am I that should 
  save this People? &quot;Wilt thou smite me as hou smotest the Egyptian yesterday?&quot; 
  Yes, although mine were he Might to save these Ten, I reached not forth mine 
  Arm against Iniquity, I spake and I was silent; and that which was appointed 
  came to pass. As it is written, the Pregnant Goddess hath let down Her Burden 
  upon the Earth.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{phi }<br>
  DE FEMINA QUADAM.</h2>
<p>Knowest thou for what Cause I am moved to write this unto hee, my Son only-begotten, 
  Child of Magick and of Mystery? It is that I thy Father am also in this Ordeal 
  of Initiation at this Hour. For the Sun is nigh unto the End of the Sign of 
  he Fishes in the Thirteenth Year of the Aeon, and the New Current of High Magick 
  leapeth forth as a Flood from the Womb of my True Lady <strong>BABALON</strong>. 
  And a Word hath come to me by he Mouth of the Scarlet Woman, whose Name is <strong>EVE</strong>, 
  or <strong>AHITHA</strong>, concerning the Temple of Jupiter that is builded 
  for me. And therein is a Woman appointed to a certain Office. Now this Woman 
  appeared to me in a Vision when I was in the House of the Juggler by the Lake 
  among the Mountains, the Sun being in Cancer in the Eleventh Year of the Aeon, 
  even in the Week after thy Birth. And I think this Woman to be Her whom I call 
  <strong>WES---RUN</strong>. But even while with a pure Heart I did invoke Her, 
  there came unto me another like unto Her, so that I am confused in my Mind and 
  bewildered. And this other Woman stirreth my true Nature in its Depth, so that 
  I will not call it Love. For the Voice of Love I know of old; but this other 
  Woman speaketh in a tongue whereof I have no Understanding.</p>
<h2 align="center">{Gamma }{chi }<br>
  DE SUA VIRTUTE.</h2>
<p>What then shall I do therein? For the Scarlet Woman adjureth me by the great 
  Name of God ITHUPHALLOS that I deal with the Other Woman as with any Woman, 
  according to my Will. But this I fear for that she is not as any Woman, and 
  I deem her to be the Vampire of this Ordeal. Now then? Shall I fear? Said I 
  not long since, when I was called of Men Eliphaz Levi Zahed, that the Error 
  of Oedipus was that he should have amed the Sphinx, and ridden her into Thebes? 
  Shall I not ake this Vampire, if she be such, and master her and turn her o 
  the Great End? &quot;Am I such a Man as should flee?&quot; Is not all Fear the 
  Word of Failure? Shall I distrust my Destiny? Am I that am the Word of the Aeon 
  of so little avail that even he whole Powers of Choronzon can disperse me? Nay, 
  o my Son, here is Courage of Ignorance and Discretion of Knowledge, and by no 
  less Virtue will I win through unto mine End. As it is written: with Courage 
  conquering Fear will I approach thee.</p>

  DE ALIQUIBUS MODIS ORACULI PETENDI.</h2>
<p>My Son, in all Judgment and Decision is great Delicacy, but most in these Matters 
  of the Will. For thou art Advocate as well as Judge, and unless thou have well 
  organized thy Mind hou art Bondslave of Prejudice. For this Cause it is adjuvant 
  to thy Wisdom to call Witnesses that are not of thine own Nature, and to ask 
  Oracles whose Interpretation is bound by fixed rule. This is the Use of the 
  Book <strong>TAROT</strong>, of the Divination by Earth, or by the other Elements, 
  or by the Book &quot;Yi-King&quot;, and many another Mode of Truth. Thou knoest 
  by thine Experience that these Arts deceive thee not, save insofar as hou deceivest 
  thyself. So then to thee that art NEMO is no Siege Perilous at this Table, but 
  to them that are yet below he Abyss is very notable Danger of Error. Yet must 
  they rain themselves constantly in these Modes, for Experience itself shall 
  teach them how their Bias toward their Desires reacteth in the End against themselves, 
  and hindereth them in he Execution of their Wills. Nevertheless, as thou well 
  knowest, the best Mode is the Creation of an Intelligible Image by Virtue of 
  the Mass of the Holy Ghost, declaring the rue Will unto thee in Terms of thy 
  Qabalah!</p>

  DE FRATRIBUS NIGRIS<br>
  FILIIS INIQUITATIS.</h2>
<p>Of the Black Brothers, o my Son, will I write these Things following. I have 
  told thee already concerning Change, how it is the Law, because every Change 
  is an Act of Love under will. So then He that is Adept Exempt, whether in our 
  Holy Order or another, may not remain in the Pillar of Mercy, because it is 
  not balanced, but is unstable. Therefore is the Choice given unto him, whether 
  he will destroy his Temple, and give up his Life, extending it to Universal 
  Life, or whether he will make a Fortress about that Temple, and abide therein, 
  in the false Sphere of Daath, which is in the Abyss. And to the Adepts of our 
  Holy Order this Choice is terrible; by Cause that they must abandon even Him 
  whose Knowledge and Conversation they have attained. Yet, o my Son, they have 
  much Help of our Order in this Aeon, because the general Formula is Love, so 
  hat their habit itself urges them to the Bed of our Lady BABALON. Know then 
  the Black Brothers by this true Sign of heir Initiation of iniquity, that that 
  they resist Change, restrict and deny Love, fear Death. Percutiantur.</p>
