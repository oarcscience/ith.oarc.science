#### A.·. A.·. Publication in Class B. Imprimatur: N. Fra A.·. A.·.

1.  This book is the Gate of the Secret of the Universe.
2.  Let the Exempt Adept procure the Prolegomena of Kant, and study it,
    paying special attention to the Antinomies.
3.  Also Hume's doctrine of Causality in his "Enquiry."
4.  Also Herbert Spencer's discussion of the three theories of the
    Universe in his "First Principles," Part I.
5.  Also Huxley's Essays on Hume and Berkeley.
6.  Also Crowley's Essays: Berashith, Time, [The Soldier and the
    Hunchback](lib148), et cetera.
7.  Also the "Logik" of Hegel.
8.  Also the "Questions of King Milinda" and the Buddhist Suttas which
    bear on Metaphysic.
9.  Let him also be accomplished in Logic. (Formal Logic, Keynes.)
    Further let him study any classical works to which his attention may
    be sufficiently directed in the course of his reading.
10. Now let him consider special problems, such as the Origin of the
    World, the Origin of Evil, Infinity, the Absolute, the Ego and the
    non-Ego, Freewill and Destiny, and such others as may attract him.
11. Let him subtly and exactly demonstrate the fallacies of every known
    solution, and let him seek a true solution by his right Ingenium.
12. In all this let him be guided only by clear reason, and let him
    forcibly suppress all other qualities such as Intuition, Aspiration,
    Emotion, and the like.
13. During these practices all forms of Magick Art and Meditation are
    forbidden to him. It is forbidden to hi to seek any refuge from his
    intellect.
14. Let then his reason hurl itself again and again against the blank
    wall of mystery which will confront him.
15. Thus also following is it said, and we deny it not. At last
    automatically his reason will take up the practice, sua sponte, and
    he shall have no rest therefrom.
16. Then will all phenomena which present themselves to him appear
    meaningless and disconnected, and his own Ego will break up into a
    series of impressions having no relation one with the other, or with
    any other thing.
17. Let this state then become so acute that it is in truth Insanity,
    and let this continue until exhaustion.
18. According to a certain deeper tendency of the individual will be the
    duration of this state.
19. It may end in real insanity, which concludes the activities of the
    Adept during this present life, or by his rebirth into his own body
    and mind with the simplicity of a little child.
20. And then shall he find all his faculties unimpaired, yet cleansed in
    a manner ineffable.
21. And he shall recall the simplicity of the Task of the Adeptus Minor,
    and apply himself thereto with fresh energy in a more direct manner.
22. And in his great weakness it may be that for awhile the new Will and
    Aspiration are not puissant, yet being undisturbed by those dead
    weeds of doubt and reason which he hath uprooted, they grow
    imperceptibly and easily like a flower.
23. And with the reappearance of the Holy Guardian Angel he may be
    granted the highest attainments, and be truly fitted for the full
    experience of the destruction of the Universe. And by the Universe
    We mean not that petty Universe which the mind of man can conceive,
    but that which is revealed to his soul in the Samadhi of
    Atmadarshana.
24. Thence may he enter into a real communion with those that are
    beyond, and he shall be competent to receive communication and
    instruction from Ourselves directly.
25. Thus shall We prepare him for the confrontation of Choronzon and the
    Ordeal of the Abyss, when we have received him into the City of the
    Pyramids.
26. So, being of Us, let the Master of the Temple accomplish that Work
    which is appointed. (In [Liber CDXVIII](418/418). is an adequate
    account of this Ordeal and Reception. See also Liber CLVI. for the
    preparation.)
27. Also concerning the Reward thereof, of his entering into the Palace
    of the King's Daughter, and of that which shall thereafter befall,
    let it be understood of the Master of the Temple. Hath he not
    attained to Understanding? Yea, verily, hath he not attained to
    Understanding?
