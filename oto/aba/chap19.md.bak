## CHAPTER XIX OF DRAMATIC RITUALS.

The Wheel turns to those effectual methods of invocation employed in the
ancient Mysteries and by certain secret bodies of initiates to-day. The
object of them is almost invariably

> *The word is unwarrantably universal. It would not be impracticable to
> adopt this method to such operations as Talismanic Magick. For
> example, one might consecrate and charge a Pantacle by the

> Magician representing the Angel, the Pantacle being the Book, and the
> person on whom the Pantacle is intended to act taking the part of the
> Scribe.*

the invocation of a God, that God conceived in a more or less material
and personal fashion. These Rituals are therefore well suited for such
persons as are capable of understanding the spirit of Magick as opposed
to the letter. One of the great advantages of them is that a large
number of persons may take part, so that there is consequently more
force available; but it is important that they should all be initiates
of the same mysteries, bound by the same oaths, and filled with the same
aspirations. They should be associated only for this one purpose.

Such a company being prepared, the story of the God should be dramatised
by a well-skilled poet accustomed to this form of composition. Lengthy
speeches and invocations should be avoided, but action should be very
full. Such ceremonies should be carefully rehearsed; but in rehearsals
care should be taken to omit the climax, which should be studied by the
principal character in private. The play should be so arranged that this
climax depends on him alone. By this means one prevents the ceremony
from becoming mechanical or hackneyed, and the element of surprise.
assists the lesser characters to get out of themselves at the supreme
moment. Following the climax there should always be an unrehearsed
ceremony, an impromptu. The most satisfactory form of this is the dance.
In such ceremonies appropriate libations may be freely used.

The Rite of Luna (Equinox I. VI) is a good example of this use. Here the
climax is the music of the goddess, the assistants remaining in silent
ecstasy.

In the rite of Jupiter the impromptu is the dance, in that of Saturn
long periods of silence.

It will be noticed that in these Rites poetry and music were largely
employed --- mostly published pieces by well-known authors and
composers. It would be better

> *"PERHAPS! One can think of certain Awful Consequences". "But, after
> all, they wouldn't seem so to the authors!" "But --- pity the poor
> Gods!" "Bother the Gods!"*

to write and compose specially for the ceremony.

> therefore congenitally possessed of the powers thereto appurtenant.
> The cock, "Peter Paul," was consequently a baptized Christian for all
> magical purposes. Order was then taken to imprison the bird; which
> done, the Magicians assuming respectively the characters of Herod,
> Herodias, Salome, and the Executioner, acted out the scene of the
> dance and the beheading, on the lines of Oscar Wilde's drama, "Peter
> Paul" being cast for the part of John the Baptist. This ceremony was
> devised and done on the spur of the moment, and its spontaneity and
> simplicity were presumably potent factors in its success.*

> for all he became a bishop, he is damned.
