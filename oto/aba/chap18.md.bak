## CHAPTER XVIII OF CLAIRVOYANCE AND THE BODY OF LIGHT ITS POWER AND ITS DEVELOPMENT ALSO CONCERNING DIVINATION

### I

Within the human body is another body of approximately the same size and
shape;

> *i.e. as a general rule. It can be altered very greatly in these
> respects.*

but made of a subtler and less illusory material. It is of course not
"real"; but then no more is the other body! Before treating of
clairvoyance one must discuss briefly this question of reality, for
misapprehension on the subject has given rise to endless trouble.

There is the story of the American in the train who saw another American
carrying a basket of unusual shape. His curiosity mastered him, and he
leant across and said: "Say, stranger, what you got in that bag?" The
other, lantern-jawed and taciturn, replied: "mongoose". The first man
was rather baffled, as he had never heard of a mongoose. After a pause
he pursued, at the risk of a rebuff: "But say, what is a Mongoose?"
"Mongoose eats snakes", replied the other. This was another poser, but
he pursued: "What in hell do you want a Mongoose for?" "Well, you see",
said the second man (in a confidential whisper) "my brother sees
snakes". The first man was more puzzled than ever; but after a long
think, he continued rather pathetically: "But say, them ain't real
snakes". "Sure", said the man with the basket, "but this Mongoose ain't
real either".

This is a perfect parable of Magick. There is no such thing as truth in
the perceptible universe; every idea when analysed is found to contain a
contradiction. It is quite useless (except as a temporary expedient) to
set up one class of ideas against another as being "more real". The
advance of man towards God is not necessarily an advance towards truth.
All philosophical systems have crumbled. But each class of ideas
possesses true relations within itself. It is possible, with Berkeley,

> *The real Berkeley did nothing of the sort: the reference here is to
> an imaginary animal invented by Dr. Johnson out of sturdy British
> ignorance.*

to deny the existence of water and of wood; but, for all that, wood
floats on water. The Magician becomes identical with the immortal
Osiris, yet the Magician dies. In this dilemma the facts must be
restated. One should preferably say that the Magician becomes conscious
of that part of himself which he calls the immortal Osiris; and that
Part does not "die".

Now this interior body of the Magician, of which we spoke at the
beginning of this chapter, does exist, and can exert certain powers
which his natural body cannot do. It can, for example, pass through
"matter", and it can move freely in every direction through space. But
this is because "matter", in the sense in which we commonly use the
word, is on another plane

> *We do not call electrical resistance, or economic laws, unreal, on
> the ground that they are not directly perceived by the senses. Our
> magical doctrine is universally accepted by sceptics --- only they
> wish to make Magick itself an exception!*

.

Now this fine body perceives a universe which we do not ordinarily
perceive. It does not necessarily perceive the universe which we do
normally perceive, so although in this body I can pass through the roof,
it does not follow that I shall be able to tell what the weather is
like. I might do so, or I might not: but if I could not, it would not
prove that I was deceiving myself in supposing that I had passed through
the roof. This body, which is called by various authors the Astral
double, body of Light, body of fire, body of desire, fine body,
scin-laeca and numberless other names is naturally fitted to perceive
objects of its own class ... in particular, the phantoms of the astral
plane.

There is some sort of vague and indeterminate relation between the
Astrals and the Materials; and it is possible, with great experience, to
deduce facts about material things from the astral aspect which they
present to the eyes of the Body of Light.

> *This is because there is a certain necessary correspondence between
> planes; as in the case of an Anglo-Indian's liver and this temper. The
> relation appears "vague and indeterminate" only in so far as one
> happens to be ignorant of the laws which state the case. The situation
> is analogous to that of the chemist before the discovery of the law of
> "Combining Weights", etc.*

This astral plane is so varied and so changeable that several
clairvoyants looking at the same thing might give totally different
accounts of what they saw; yet they might each make correct deductions.
In looking at a man the first clairvoyant might say: "The lines of force
are all drooping"; the second: "It seems all dirty and spotty"; a third;
"The Aura looks very ragged." Yet all might agree in deducing that the
man was in ill-health. In any case all such deductions are rather
unreliable. One must be a highly skilled man before one can trust one's
vision. A great many people think that they are extremely good at the
business, when in fact they have only made some occasional shrewd
guesses (which they naturally remember) in the course of hundreds of
forgotten failures.

The only way to test clairvoyance is to keep a careful record of every
experiment made. For example, FRATER O. M. once gave a clairvoyant a
waistcoat to psychometrize. He made 56 statements about the owner of the
waistcoat; of these 4 were notably right; 17, though correct, were of
that class of statement which is true of almost everybody. The remainder
were wrong. It was concluded from this that he showed no evidence of any
special power. In fact, his bodily eyes, --- if he could discern
Tailoring --- would have served him better, for he thought the owner of
the vest was a corn-chandler, instead of an earl, as he is.

The Magician can hardly take too much trouble to develop this power in
himself. It is extremely useful to him in guarding himself against
attack; in obtaining warnings, in judging character, and especially in
watching the process of his Ceremonies.

There are a great many ways of acquiring the power. Gaze into a crystal,
or into a pool of ink in the palm of the hand, or into a mirror, or into
a teacup. Just as with a microscope the expert operator keeps both eyes
open, though seeing only through the one at the eye-piece of the
instrument, so the natural eyes, ceasing to give any message to the
brain, the attention is withdrawn from them, and the man begins to see
through the Astral eyes.

These methods appear to The MASTER THERION to be unsatisfactory. Very
often they do not work at all. It is difficult to teach a person to use
these methods; and, worst of all, they are purely passive! You can see
only what is shewn you, and you are probably shewn things perfectly
pointless and irrelevant.

The proper method is as follows: --- Develop the body of Light until it
is just as real to you as your other body, teach it to travel to any
desired symbol, and enable it to perform all necessary Rites and
Invocations. In short, educate it. Ultimately, the relation of that body
with your own must be exceedingly intimate; but before this harmonizing
takes place, you should begin by a careful differentiation. The first
thing to do, therefore, is to get the body outside your own. To avoid
muddling the two, you begin by imagining a shape resembling yourself
standing in front of you. Do not say: "Oh, it's only imagination!" The
time to test that is later on, when you have secured a fairly clear
mental image of such a body. Try to imagine how your own body would look
if you were standing in its place; try to transfer your consciousness to
the Body of Light. Your own body has its eyes shut. Use the eyes of the
Body of Light to describe the objects in the room behind you. Don't say.
"It's only an effort of subconscious memory" ... the time to test that
is later on.

As soon as you feel more or less at home in the fine body, let it rise
in the air. Keep on feeling the sense of rising; keep on looking about
you as you rise until you see landscapes or beings of the astral plane.
Such have a quality all their own. They are not like material things ---
they are not like mental pictures --- they seem to lie between the two.

After some practice has made you adept, so that in the course of any
hour's journey you can reckon on having a fairly eventful time, turn
your attention to reaching a definite place on the astral plane; invoke
Mercury, for example, and examine carefully your record of the resulting
vision --- discover whether the symbols which you have seen correspond
with the conventional symbols of Mercury.

This testing of the spirits is the most important branch of the whole
tree of Magick. Without it, one is lost in the jungle of delusion. Every
spirit, up to God himself, is ready to deceive you if possible, to make
himself out more important than he is; in short to lay in wait for your
soul in 333 separate ways. Remember that after all the highest of all
the Gods is only the Magus,

> *See Liber 418, 3rd Aethyr.*

Mayan, the greatest of all the devils.

You may also try "rising on the planes".

> *See Infra and Appendix.*

With a little practice, especially if you have a good Guru, you ought to
be able to slip in and out of your astral body as easily as you slip in
and out of a dressing-gown. It will then no longer be so necessary for
your astral body to be sent far off; without moving an inch you will be
able to "turn on" its eyes and ears --- as simply as the man with the
microscope (mentioned above) can transfer his complete attention from
one eye to the other.

Now, however unsuccessful your getting out the body may apparently have
been, it is most necessary to use every effort to bring it properly
back. Make the Body of Light coincide in space with the physical body,
assume the God-Form, and vibrate the name of Harpocrates with the utmost
energy; then recover unity of consciousness. If you fail to do this
properly you may find yourself in serious trouble. Your Body of Light
may wander away uncontrolled, and be attacked and obsessed. You will
become aware of this through the occurrence of headache, bad dreams, or
even more serious signs such as hysteria, fainting fits, possibly
madness or paralysis. Even the worst of these attacks will probably wear
off, but it may leave you permanently damaged to a greater or less
extent.

A great majority of "spiritualists", "occultists", "Toshosophists", are
pitiable examples of repeated losses from this cause.

The emotional type of religionist also suffers in this way. Devotion
projects the fine body, which is seized and vampirized by the demon
masquerading as "Christ" or "Mary", or whoever may be the object of
worship. Complete absence of all power to concentrate thought, to follow
an argument, to formulate a Will, to hold fast to an opinion or a course
of action, or even to keep a solemn oath, mark indelibly those who have
thus lost parts of their souls. They wander from one new cult to another
even crazier. Occasionally such persons drift for a moment into the
surrounding of The MASTER THERION, and are shot out by the simple
process of making them try to do a half-hour's honest work of any kind.

In projecting the Astral, it is a valuable additional safeguard to
perform the whole operation in a properly consecrated circle.

Proceed with great caution, then, but proceed. In time your Body of
Light will be as strong against spirits as your other body against the
winds of Heaven. All depends upon the development of that Body of Light.
It must be furnished with an organism as ramified and balanced as its
shadowy brother, the material body.

To recapitulate once more, then, the first task is to develop your own
Body of light within your own circle without reference to any other
inhabitants of the world to which it belongs.

That which you have accomplished with the subject you may now proceed to
do with the object. You will learn to see the astral appearance of
material things; and although this does not properly belong to pure
clairvoyance, one may here again mention that you should endeavour to
the utmost to develop and fortify this Body of Light. The best and
simplest way to do this is to use it constantly, to exercise it in every
way. In particular it may be employed in ceremonies of initiation or of
invocation --- while the physical body remains silent and still.

In doing this it will often be necessary to create a Temple on the
astral plane. It is excellent practice to create symbols. This one
precaution is needed: after using them, they should be reabsorbed.

Having learned to create astral forms, the next step will be at first
very difficult. Phantasmal and fleeting as the astral is in general,
those forms which are definitely attached to the material possess
enormous powers of resistance, and it consequently requires very high
potential to influence them. The material analogues seem to serve as a
fortress. Even where a temporary effect is produced, the inertia of
matter draws it back to the normal; yet the power of the trained and
consecrated will in a well-developed astral body is such that it can
even produce a permanent change in the material upon whose Body of Light
you are working, e.g.; one can heal the sick by restoring a healthy
appearance to their astral forms. On the other hand, it is possible so
to disintegrate the Body of Light even of a strong man that he will fall
dead.

Such operations demand not only power, but judgment. Nothing can upset
the sum total of destiny --- everything must be paid for the uttermost
farthing. For this reason a great many operations theoretically possible
cannot be performed. Suppose, for example, you see two men of similarly
unhealthy astral appearance. In one case the cause may be slight and
temporary. Your help suffices to restore him in a few minutes. The
other, who looks no worse, is really oppressed by a force incalculably
greater than you could control, and you would only damage yourself by
attempting to help him. The diagnosis between the two cases could be
made by an investigation of the deeper strata of the astral, such as
compose the"causal body".

A body of black magicians under Anna Kingsford

once attempted to kill a vivisector who was not particularly well known;
and they succeeded in making him seriously ill. But in attempting the
same thing with Pasteur they produced no effect whatever, because
Pasteur was a great genius --- an adept in his own line far greater than
she in hers --- and because millions of people were daily blessing him.
It cannot be too clearly understood that magical force is subject to the
same laws of proportion as any other kind of force. It is useless for a
mere millionaire to try to bankrupt a man who has the Bank of England
behind him.

To sum up, the first task is to separate the astral form from the
physical body, the second to develop the powers of the astral body, in
particular those of sight, travel, and interpretation; third, to unify
the two bodies without muddling them.

This being accomplished, the magician is fitted to deal with the
invisible.

### II

It is now useful to contine with considerations of other planes, which
have commonly been classed under the Astral. There is some reason for
this, as the delimitations are somewhat vague. Just as the vegetable
kingdom merges into the animal, and as the material plane has beings
which encroach upon the boundaries of the astral, so do we find it in
the higher planes.

The mental images which appear during meditation are subjective, and
pertain not at all to the astral plane. Only very rarely do astral
images occur during meditation. It is a bad break in the circle, as a
rule, when they do.

There is also a Magical Plane. This touches the material, and even
includes a portion of it. It includes the Astral, chiefly a full-blooded
type of the Astral. It reaches to and includes most, if not all, of the
spiritual planes.

The Magical plane is thus the most comprehensive of all. Egyptian Gods
are typical inhabitants of this plane, and it is the home of every
Adept.

The spiritual planes are of several types, but are all distinguished by
a reality and intensity to be found nowhere else. Their inhabitants are
formless, free of space and time, and distinguished by incomparable
brilliance.

There are also a number of sub-planes, as, for example, the Alchemical.
This plane will often appear in the practice of "Rising on the Planes";
its images are usually those of gardens curiously kept, mountains
furnished with peculiar symbols, hieroglyphic animals, or such figures
as that of the "Hermetic Arcanum", and pictures like the "Goldseekers"
and the "Massacre of the Innocents" of Basil Valentine. There is a
unique quality about the alchemical Plane which renders its images
immediately recognizable.

There are also planes corresponding to various religions past and
present, all of which have their peculiar unity.

It is of the utmost importance to the "Clairvoyant" or "traveler in the
fine body" to be able to find his way to any desired plane, and operate
therein as its ruler.

The Neophyte of A.'. A.'. is examined most strictly in this practice
before he is passed to the degree of Zelator.

In "Rising on the Planes" one must usually pass clear through the Astral
to the Spiritual. Some will be unable to do this. The "fine body" which
is good enough to subsist on lower planes, a shadow among shadows, will
fail to penetrate the higher strata. It requires a great development of
this body, and an intense infusion of the highest spiritual constituents
of man, before he can pierce the veils. The constant practice of Magick
is the best preparation possible. Even though the human consciousness
fail to reach the goal, the consciousness of the fine body itself may do
so, wherefore whoso travels in that body on a subsequent occasion may be
found worthy; and its success will react favourably on the human
consciousness, and increase its likelihood of success in its next
magical operation.

Similarly, the powers gained in this way will strengthen the magician in
his mediation-practices. His Will becomes better able to assist the
concentration, to destroy the mental images which disturb it, and to
reject the lesser rewards of that practice which tempt, and too often
stop the progress of, the mystic.

Although it is said that the spiritual lies "beyond the astral", this is
theoretical;

> *The Hon. Bertrand Russell's "Principia Mathematica" may be said to
> "lie beyond" Colenso's "School Arithmetic"; but one can take the
> former book from one's shelves --- as every one should --- and read it
> without first going all through the latter again.*

the advanced Magician will not find it to be so in practice. He will be
able by suitable invocation to travel directly to any place desired. In
Liber 418 an example of perfection is given. The Adept who explored
these Aethyrs did not have to pass through and beyond the Universe, the
whole of which yet lies within even the inmost (30th) Aethyr. He was
able to summon the Aethyrs he wanted, and His chief difficulty was that
sometimes He was at first unable to pierce their veils. In fact, as the
Book shows, it was only by virtue of successive and most exalted
initiations undergone in the Aethyrs themselves that He was able to
penetrate beyond the 15th. The Guardians of such fortresses know how to
guard.

The MASTER THERION has published the most important practical magical
secrets in the plainest language. No one, by virtue of being clever or
learned, has understood one word; and those unworthy who have profaned
the sacrament have but eaten and drunken damnation to themselves.

One may bring down stolen fire in a hollow tube from Heaven, as The
MASTER THERION indeed has done in a way that no other adept dared to do
before him. But the thief, the Titan, must foreknow and consent to his
doom to be chained upon a lonely rock, the vulture devouring his liver,
for a season, until Hercules, the strong man armed by virtue of that
very fire, shall come and release him.

The TEITAN

> *GR:Tau-Epsilon-Iota-Tau-Alpha-Nu = 300+5+10+300+1+50 = 666.*

--- whose number is the number of a man, six hundred and three score and
six --- unsubdued, consoled by Asia and Panthea, must send forth
constant showers of blessing not only upon Man whose incarnation he is,
but upon the tyrant and the persecutor. His infinite pain must thrill
his heart with joy, since every pang is but the echo of some new flame
that leaps upon the earth lit by his crime.

For the Gods are the enemies of Man; it is Nature that Man must overcome
ere he enter into his kingdom.&lt;

"All elements must at one time have been separate, --- that would be the
case with great heat. Now when atoms get to the sun, when we get to the
sun, we get that immense, extreme heat, and all the elements are
themselves again. Imagine that each atom of each element possesses the
memory of all his adventures in combination. By the way, that atom
(fortified with that memory) would not be the same atom; yet it is,
because it has gained nothing from anywhere except this memory.
Therefore, by the lapse of time, and by virtue of memory, a thing could
become something more than itself; and thus a real development is
possible. One can then see a reason for any element deciding to go
through this series of incarnations; because so, and only so, can he go;
and he suffers the lapse of memory which he has during these
incarnations, because he knows he will come through unchanged.

"Therefore you can have an infinite number of gods, individual and equal
though diverse, each one supreme and utterly indestructible. This is
also the only explanation of how a being could create a war {WEH NOTE:
SIC, probably should be "world"} in which war, evil, etc. exist. Evil is
only an appearance, because, (like "good") it cannot affect the
substance itself, but only multiply its combinations. This is something
the same as mystic monotheism, but the objection to that theory is that
God has to create things which are all parts of himself, so that their
interplay is false. If we presuppose many elements, their interplay is
natural. It is no objection to this theory to ask who made the elements,
--- the elements are at least there, and God, when you look for him, is
not there. Theism is "obscurum per obscurius." A male star is built up
from the centre outwards; a female from the circumference inwards. This
is what is meant when we say that woman has no soul. It explains fully
the difference between the sexes.&gt;&gt; The true God is man. In man
are all things hidden. Of these the Gods, Nature, Time, all the powers
of the universe are rebellious slaves. It is these that men must fight
and conquer in the power and in the name of the Beast that hath availed
them, the Titan, the Magus, the Man whose number is six hundred and
three score and six.

### III

The practice of Rising on the Planes is of such importance that special
attention must be paid to it. It is part of the essential technique of
Magick. Instruction in this practice has been given with such
conciseness in Liber O, that one cannot do better than quote verbatim
(the "previous experiment" referred to in the first sentence is the
ordinary astral journey.):

"1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results
of importance. But it is susceptible of a development which merges into
a form of Dharana --- concentration --- and as such may lead to the very
highest ends. The principal use of the practice in the last chapter is
to familiarise the student with every kind of obstacle and every kind of
delusion, so that he may be perfect master of every idea that may arise
in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it, to cause it instantly to
obey his will.

"2. Let him then begin exactly as before; but with the most intense
solemnity and determination.

"3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a
line exactly perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his
physical body is situated (or, to put it more simply, straight upwards).

"4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost
overcomes him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to
do so, and that figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.
Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way
upward and onward!

"5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in him.
Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his
hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from
the very Throne of God himself that a voice issues bidding him stay and
be content, let him struggle on, ever on.

"6. At last there must come a moment when his whole being is swallowed
up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia. Let him sink (when no
longer can he strive, though his tongue be bitten through with the
effort and the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of
unconsciousness; and then on coming to himself, let him write down
soberly and accurately a record of all that hath occurred: yea, a record
of all that hath occurred."

Of course, the Rising may be done from any starting pint. One can go
(for example) into the circle of Jupiter, and the results, especially in
the lower planes, will be very different to those obtained from a
Saturnian starting point.

The student should undertake a regular series of such experiments, in
order to familiarise himself not only with the nature of the different
spheres, but with the inner meaning of each. Of course, it is not
necessary in every case to push the practice to exhaustion, as described
in the instructions, but this is the proper thing to do whenever
definitely practising, in order to acquire the power of Rising. But,
having obtained this power, it is, of course, legitimate to rise to any
particular plane that may be necessary for the purpose of exploration,
as in the case of the visions recorded in Liber 418, where the method
may be described as mixed. In such a case, it is not enough to invoke
the place you wish to visit, because you may not be able to endure its
pressure, or to breathe its atmosphere. Several instances occur in that
record where the seer was unable to pass through certain gateways, or to
remain in certain contemplations. He had to undergo certain Initiations
before he was able to proceed. Thus, it is necessary that the technique
of Magick should be perfected. The Body of Light must be rendered
capable of going everywhere and doing everything. It is, therefore,
always the question of drill which is of importance. You have got to go
out Rising on the Planes every day of your life, year after year. You
are not to be disheartened by failure, or too much encouraged by
success, in any one practice or set of practices. What you are doing is
what will be of real value to you in the end; and that is, developing a
character, creating a Karma, which will give you the power to do your
will.

### IV

Divination is so important a branch of Magick as almost to demand a
separate treatise.

Genius is composed of two sides; the active and the passive. The power
to execute the Will is but blind force unless the Will be enlightened.
At every stage of a Magical Operation it is necessary to know what one
is doing, and to be sure that one is acting wisely. Acute sensitiveness
is always associated with genius; the power to perceive the universe
accurately, to analyse, coordinate, and judge impressions is the
foundation of all great Work. An army is but a blundering brute unless
its intelligence department works as it should.

The Magician obtains the transcendental knowledge necessary to an
intelligent course of conduct directly in consciousness by clairvoyance
and clairaudience; but communication with superior intelligences demands
elaborate preparation, even after years of successful performance.

It is therefore useful to possess an art by which one can obtain at a
moment's notice any information that may be necessary. This art is
divination. The answers to one's questions in divination are not
conveyed directly but through the medium of a suitable series of
symbols. These symbols must be interpreted by the diviner in terms of
his problem. It is not practicable to construct a lexicon in which the
solution of every difficulty is given in so many words. It would be
unwieldy; besides, nature does not happen to work on those lines.

The theory of any process of divination may be stated in a few simple
terms.

1\. We postulate the existence of intelligences, either within or
without the diviner, of which he is not immediately conscious. (It does
not matter to the theory whether the communicating spirit so-called is
an objective entity or a concealed portion of the diviner's mind.) We
assume that such intelligences are able to reply correctly --- within
limits --- to the questions asked.

2\. We postulate that it is possible to construct a compendium of
hieroglyphs sufficiently elastic in meaning to include every possible
idea, and that one or more of these may always be taken to represent any
idea. We assume that any of these hieroglyphics will be understood by
the intelligences with whom we wish to communicate in the same sense as
it is by ourselves. We have therefore a sort of language. One may
compare it to a "lingua franca" which is perhaps defective in expressing
fine shades of meaning, and so is unsuitable for literature, but which
yet serves for the conduct of daily affairs in places where many tongues
are spoken. Hindustani is an example of this. But better still is the
analogy between the conventional signs and symbols employed by
mathematicians, who can thus convey their ideas perfectly

> *As a matter of fact, they cannot. The best qualified are the most
> diffident as to having grasped the meaning of their colleagues with
> exactitude; in criticising their writings they often make a point of
> apologising for possible misunderstanding.*

without speaking a word of each other's languages.

3\. We postulate that the intelligences whom wish to consul are willing,
or may be compelled, to answer us truthfully.

Let us first consider the question of the compendium of symbols. The
alphabet of a language is a more or less arbitrary way of transcribing
the sounds employed in speaking it. The letters themselves have not
necessarily any meaning as such. But in a system of divination each
symbol stands for a definite idea. It would not interfere with the
English language to add a few new letters. In fact, some systems of
shorthand have done so. But a system of symbols suitable for divination
must be a complete representation of the Universe, so that each is
absolute, and the whole insusceptible to increase or diminution. It is
(in fact) technically a pantacle in the fullest sense of the word.

Let us consider some prominent examples of such system. We may observe
that a common mode of divination is to inquire of books by placing the
thumb at random within the leaves. The Books of the Sybil, the works of
Vergil, and the Bible have been used very frequently for this purpose.
For theoretical justification, one must assume that the book employed is
a perfect representation of the Universe. But even if this were the
case, it is an inferior form of construction, because the only
reasonable conception of the Cosmos is mathematical and hieroglyphic
rather than literary. In the case of a book, such as the Book of the Law
which is the supreme truth and the perfect rule of life, it is not
repugnant to good sense to derive an oracle from its pages. It will of
course be remarked that the Book of the Law is not merely a literary
compilation but a complex mathematical structure. It therefore fulfils
the required conditions.

The principal means of divination in history are astrology, geomancy,
the Tarot, the Holy Qabalah, and the Yi King. There are hundreds of
others; from pyromancy, oneiromancy, auguries from sacrifices, and the
spinning-top of some ancient oracles to the omens drawn from the flight
of birds and the prophesying of tea-leaves. It will be sufficient for
our present purpose to discuss only the five systems first enumerated.

ASTROLOGY is theoretically a perfect method, since the symbols employed
actually exist in the macrocosm, and thus possess a natural
correspondence with microcosmic affairs. But in practice the
calculations involved are overwhelmingly complicated. A horoscope is
never complete. It needs to be supplemented by innumerable other
horoscopes. For example, to obtain a judgment on the simplest question,
one requires not only the nativities of the people involved, some of
which are probably inaccessible, but secondary figures for directions
and transits, together with progressed horoscopes, to say nothing of
prenatal, mundane, and even horary figures. To appreciate the entire
mass of data, to balance the elements of so vast a concourse of forces,
and to draw a single judgment therefrom, is a task practically beyond
human capacity. Besides all this, the actual effects of the planetary
positions and aspects are still almost entirely unknown. No two
astrologers agree on all points; and most of them are at odds on
fundamental principles.

> *Nearly all professional astrologers are ignorant of their own
> subject, as of all others.*

This science had better be discarded unless the student chances to feel
strongly drawn toward it. It is used by the MASTER THERION Himself with
fairly satisfactory results, but only in special cases, in a strictly
limited sphere, and with particular precautions. Even so, He feels great
diffidence in basing His conduct on the result so obtained.

GEOMANCY has the advantage of being rigorously mathematical. A hand-book
of the science is to be found in Equinox I, II. The objection to its use
lies in the limited number of the symbols. To represent the Universe by
no more than 16 combinations throws too much work upon them. There is
also a great restriction arising from the fact that although 15 symbols
appear in the final figure, there are, in reality, but 4, the remaining
11 being drawn by an ineluctable process from the "Mothers". It may be
added that the tables given in the handbook for the interpretation of
the figure are exceedingly vague on the one hand, and insufficiently
comprehensive on the other. Some Adepts, however, appear to find this
system admirable, and obtain great satisfaction from its use. Once more,
the personal equation must be allowed full weight. At one time the
MASTER THERION employed it extensively; but He was never wholly at ease
with it; He found the interpretation very difficult. Moreover, it seemed
to Him that the geomantic intelligences themselves were of a low order,
the scope of which was confined to a small section of the things which
interested Him; also, they possessed a point of view of their own which
was far from sympathetic with His, so that misunderstanding constantly
interfered with the Work.

THE TAROT and THE HOLY QABALAH may be discussed together. The
theoretical basis of both is identical: The Tree of Life.

> *Both these subjects may be studied in the Equinox in several articles
> appearing in several numbers.*

The 78 symbols of the Tarot are admirably balanced and combined. They
are adequate to all demands made upon them; each symbol is not only
mathematically precise, but possesses an artistic significance which
helps the diviner to understand them by stimulating his aesthetic
perceptions. The MASTER THERION finds that the Tarot is infallible in
material questions. The successive operations describe the course of
events with astonishing wealth of detail, and the judgments are reliable
in all respects. But a proper divination means at least two hours' hard
work, even by the improved method developed by Him from the traditions
of initiates. Any attempt to shorten the proceedings leads to
disappointment; furthermore, the symbols do not lend themselves readily
to the solution of spiritual questions.

The Holy Qabalah, based as it is on pure number, evidently possesses an
infinite number of symbols. Its scope is conterminous with existence
itself; and it lacks nothing in precision, purity, or indeed in any
other perfection. But it cannot be taught;

> *It is easy to teach the General Principles of exegesis, and the main
> doctrines. There is a vast body of knowledge common to all cases; but
> this is no more than the basis on which the student must erect his
> original Research.*

each man must select for himself the materials for the main structure of
his system. It requires years of work to erect a worthy building. Such a
building is never finished; every day spent on it adds new ornaments.
The Qabalah is therefore a living Temple of the Holy Ghost. It is the
man himself and his universe expressed in terms of thought whose
language is so rich that even the letters of its alphabet have no limit.
This system is so sublime that it is unsuited to the solution of the
petty puzzles of our earthly existence. In the light of the Qabalah, the
shadows of transitory things are instantly banished.

The YI KING is the most satisfactory system for general work. The MASTER
THERION is engaged in the preparation of a treatise on the subject, but
the labour involved is so great that He cannot pledge Himself to have it
ready at any definite time. The student must therefore make his own
investigations into the meaning of the 64 hexagrams as best he can.

The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. Its structure is
cognate with that of the Qabalah; the identity is so intimate that the
existence of two such superficially different systems is transcendent
testimony to the truth of both. It is in some ways the most perfect
hieroglyph ever constructed. It is austere and sublime, yet withal so
adaptable to every possible emergency that its figures may be
interpreted to suit all classes of questions. One may resolve the most
obscure spiritual difficulties no less than the most mundane dilemmas;
and the symbol which opens the gates of the most exalted palaces of
initiation is equally effective when employed to advise one in the
ordinary business of life. The MASTER THERION has found the Yi King
entirely satisfactory in every respect. The intelligences which direct
it show no inclination to evade the question or to mislead the querent.
A further advantage is that the actual apparatus is simple. Also the
system is easy to manipulate, and five minutes is sufficient to obtain a
fairly detailed answer to any but the most obscure questions.

With regard to the intelligences whose business it is to give
information to the diviner, their natures differ widely, and correspond
more or less to the character of the medium of divination. Thus, the
geomantic intelligences are gnomes, spirits of an earthy nature,
distinguished from each other by the modifications due to the various
planetary and zodiacal influences which pertain to the several symbols.
The intelligence governing Puella is not to be confused with that of
Venus or of Libra. It is simply a particular terrestrial daemon which
partakes of those natures.

The Tarot, on the other hand, being a book, is under Mercury, and the
intelligence of each card is fundamentally Mercurial. Such symbols are
therefore peculiarly proper to communicate thought. They are not gross,
like the geomantic daemons; but, as against this, they are unscrupulous
in deceiving the diviner.

The Yi King is served by beings free from these defects. The intense
purity of the symbols prevent them from being usurped by intelligences
with an axe of their own to grind.

> sincerity of the Figures of Fu and King Wan.*

It is always essential for the diviner to obtain absolute magical
control over the intelligences of the system which he adopts. He must
not leave the smallest loop-hole for being tricked, befogged, or mocked.
He must not allow them to use casuistry in the interpretation of his
questions. It is a common knavery, especially in geomancy, to render an
answer which is literally true, and yet deceives. For instance, one
might ask whether some business transaction would be profitable, and
find, after getting an affirmative answer, that it really referred to
the other party to the affair!

There is, on the surface, no difficulty at all in getting replies. In
fact, the process is mechanical; success is therefore assured, bar a
stroke of apoplexy. But, even suppose we are safe from deceit, how can
we know that the question has really been put to another mind,
understood rightly, and answered from knowledge? It is obviously
possible to check one's operations by clairvoyance, but this is rather
like buying a safe to keep a brick in. Experience is the only teacher.
One acquires what one may almost call a new sense. One feels in one's
self whether one is right or not. The diviner must develop this sense.
It resembles the exquisite sensibility of touch which is found in the
great billiard player whose fingers can estimate infinitesimal degrees
of force, or the similar phenomenon in the professional taster of tea or
wine who can distinguish fantastically subtle differences of flavour.

It is a hard saying; but in the order to divine without error, one ought
to be a Master of the Temple. Divination affords excellent practice for
those who aspire to that exalted eminence, for the faintest breath of
personal preference will deflect the needle from the pole of truth in
the answer. Unless the diviner have banished utterly from his mind the
minutest atom of interest in the answer to his question, he is almost
certain to influence that answer in favour of his personal inclinations.

The psycho-analyst will recall the fact that dreams are phantasmal
representations of the unconscious Will of the sleeper, and that not
only are they images of that Will instead of representations of
objective truth, but the image itself is confused by a thousand
cross-currents set in motion by the various complexes and inhibitions of
his character. If therefore one consults the oracle, one must take sure
that one is not consciously or unconsciously bringing pressure to bear
upon it. It is just as when an Englishman cross-examines a Hindu, the
ultimate answer will be what the Hindu imagines will best please the
inquirer.

The same difficulty appears in a grosser form when one receives a
perfectly true reply, but insists on interpreting it so as to suit one's
desires. The vast majority of people who go to "fortunetellers" have
nothing else in mind but the wish to obtain supernatural sanction for
their follies. Apart from Occultism altogether, every one knows that
when people ask for advice, they only want to be told how wise they are.
Hardly any one acts on the most obviously commonsense counsel if it
happens to clash with his previous intentions. Indeed, who would take
counsel unless he were warned by some little whisper in his heart that
he was about to make a fool of himself, which he is determined to do,
and only wants to be able to blame his best friend, or the oracle, when
he is overtaken by the disaster which his own interior mentor foresees?

Those who embark on divination will be wise to consider the foregoing
remarks very deeply. They will know when they are getting deep enough by
the fact of the thought beginning to hurt them. It is essential to
explore oneself to the utmost, to analyse one's mind until one can be
positive, beyond the possibility of error, that one is able to detach
oneself entirely from the question. The oracle is a judge; it must be
beyond bribery and prejudice.

It is impossible in practice to lay down rules for the interpretation of
symbols. Their nature must be investigated by intellectual methods such
as the Qabalah, but the precise shape of meaning in any one case, and
the sphere and tendency of its application, must be acquired by
experience, that is, but induction, by recording and classifying one's
experiments over a long period; and --- this is the better part --- by
refining one's ratiocination to the point where it becomes instinct or
intuition, whichever one likes to call it.

It is proper in cases where the sphere of the question is well marked to
begin the divination by invocations of the forces thereto appropriate.
An error of judgment as to the true character of the question would
entail penalties proportionate to the extent of that error; and the
delusions resulting from a divination fortified by invocation would be
more serious than if one had not employed such heavy artillery.

> *The apparent high sanction for the error would fortify the obstinacy
> of the mule.*

There can, however, be no objection to preparing oneself by a general
purification and consecration devised with the object of detaching
oneself from one's personality and increasing the sensitiveness of one's
faculties.

All divination comes under the general type of the element Air. The
peculiar properties of air are in consequence its uniform
characteristics. Divination is subtle and intangible. It moves with
mysterious ease, expanding, contracting, flowing, responsive to the
slightest stress. It receives and transmits every vibration without
retaining any. It becomes poisonous when its oxygen is defiled by
passing through human lungs.

There is a peculiar frame of mind necessary to successful divination.
The conditions of the problem are difficult. It is obviously necessary
for the mind of the diviner to be concentrated absolutely upon his
question. Any intrusive thought will confuse the oracle as certainly as
the reader of a newspaper is confused when he reads a paragraph into
which a few lines have strayed from another column. It is equally
necessary that the muscles with which he manipulates the apparatus of
divination must be entirely independent of any volition of his. He must
lend them for the moment to the intelligence whom he is consulting, to
be guided in their movement to make the necessary mechanical actions
which determine the physical factor of the operation. It will be obvious
that this is somewhat awkward for the diviner who is also a magician,
for as a magician he has been constantly at work to keep all his forces
under his own control, and to prevent the slightest interference with
them by any alien Will. It is, in fact, commonly the case, or so says
the experience of The MASTER THERION, that the most promising Magicians
are the most deplorable diviners, and vice versa. It is only when the
aspirant approaches perfection that he becomes able to reconcile these
two apparently opposing faculties. Indeed, there is no surer sign of
all-round success than this ability to put the whole of one's powers at
the service of any type of task.

With regard to the mind, again, it would seem that concentration on the
question makes more difficult the necessary detachment from it. Once
again, the diviner stands in need of a considerable degree of attainment
in the practices of meditation. He must have succeeded in destroying the
tendency of the ego to interfere with the object of thought. He must be
able to conceive of a thing out of all relation with anything else. The
regular practice of concentration leads to this result; in fact, it
destroys the thing itself as we have hitherto conceived it; for the
nature of things is always veiled from us by our habit of regarding them
as in essential relation without ourselves and our reactions toward
them.

One can hardly expect the diviner to make Samadhi with his question ---
that would be going too far, and destroy the character of the operation
by removing the question from the class of concatenated ideas. It would
mean interpreting the question in terms of "without limit", and this
imply an equally formless answer. But he should approximate to this
extreme sufficiently to allow the question entire freedom to make for
itself its own proper links with the intelligence directing the answer,
preserving its position on its own plane, and evoking the necessary
counterpoise to its own deviation from the norm of nothingness.

We may recapitulate the above reflections in a practical form. We will
suppose that one wishes to divine by geomancy whether or no one should
marry, it being assumed that one's emotional impulses suggest so rash a
course. The man takes his wand and his sand; the traces the question,
makes the appropriate pentagram, and the sigil of the spirit. Before
tracing the dashes which are to determine the four "Mothers", he must
strictly examine himself. He must banish from his mind every thought
which can possibly act as an attachment to his proposed partner. He must
banish all thoughts which concern himself, those of apprehension no less
than those of ardour. He must carry his introspection as far as
possible. He must observe with all the subtlety at his command whether
it pains him to abandon any of these thoughts. So long as his mind is
stirred, however slightly, by one single aspect of the subject, he is
not fit to begin to form the figure. He must sink his personality in
that of the intelligence hearing the question propounded by a stranger
to whom he is indifferent, but whom it is his business to serve
faithfully. He must now run over the whole affair in his mind, making
sure of this utter aloofness therefrom. He must also make sure that his
muscles are perfectly free to respond to the touch of the Will of that
intelligence. (It is of course understood that he has not become so
familiar with geomancy by dint of practice as to be able to calculate
subconsciously what figures he will form; for this would vitiate the
experiment entirely. It is, in fact, one of the objections to geomancy
that sooner or later one does become aware at the time of tracing them
whether the dots are going to be even or odd. This needs a special
training to correct).

Physio-psychological theory will probably maintain that the "automatic"
action of the hand is controlled by the brain no less than in the case
of conscious volition; but this is an additional argument for
identifying the brain with the intelligence invoked.

Having thus identified himself as closely as possible with that
intelligence, and concentrated on the question as if the "prophesying
spirit" were giving its whole attention thereto, he must await the
impulse to trace the marks on the sand; and, as soon as it comes let it
race to the finish. Here arises another technical difficulty. One has to
make 16 rows of dots; and, especially for the beginner, the mind has to
grapple with the apprehension lest the hand fail to execute the required
number. It is also troubled by fearing to exceed; but excess does not
matter. Extra lines are simply null and void, so that the best plan is
to banish that thought, and make sure only of not stopping too soon.

> *Practice soon teaches one to count subconsciously ... yes, and that
> is the other difficulty again!*

The lines being traced, the operation is over as far as spiritual
qualities are required, for a time. The process of setting up the figure
for judgment is purely mechanical.

But, in the judgment, the diviner stands once more in need of his inmost
and utmost attainments. He should exhaust the intellectual sources of
information at his disposal, and form from them his judgment. But having
done this, he should detach his mind from what it has just formulated,
and proceed to concentrate it on the figure as a whole, almost as if it
were the object of his meditation. One need hardly repeat that in both
these operations detachment from one's personal partialities is as
necessary as it was in the first part of the work. In setting up the
figure, bias would beget a Freudian phantasm to replace the image of
truth which the figure ought to be; and it is not too much to say that
the entire subconscious machinery of the body and mind lends itself with
horrid willingness to this ape-like antic of treason. But now that the
figure stands for judgment, the same bias would tend to form its
phantasm of wish-fulfilment in a different manner. It would act through
the mind to bewray sound judgment. It might, for example, induce one to
emphasize the Venereal element in Puella at the expense of the
Saturnian. It might lead one to underrate the influence of a hostile
figure, or to neglect altogether some element of importance. The MASTER
THERION has known cases where the diver was so afraid of an unfavourable
answer that he made actual mistakes in the simple mechanical
construction of the figure! Finally, in the summing up; it is fatally
easy to slur over unpleasantness, and to breathe on the tiniest spark
that promises to kindle the tinder --- the rotten rags! --- of hope.

The concluding operation is therefore to obtain a judgment of the
figure, independent of all intellectual or moral restraint. One must
endeavour to apprehend it as a thing absolute in itself. One must treat
it, in short, very much the same as one did the question; as a mystical
entity, till now unrelated with other phenomena. One must, so to speak,
adore it as a god, uncritically: "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth."
It must be allowed to impose its intrinsic individuality on the mind, to
put its fingers independently on whatever notes it pleases.

In this way one obtains an impression of the true purport of the answer;
and one obtains it armed with a sanction superior to any sensible
suggestions. It comes from and to a part of the individual which is
independent of the influence of environment; is adjusted to that
environment by true necessity, and not by the artifices of such
adaptations as our purblind conception of convenience induces us to
fabricate.

The student will observe from the above that divination is in one sense
an art entirely separate from that of Magick; yet it interpenetrates
Magick at every point. The fundamental laws of both are identical. The
right use of divination has already been explained; but it must be added
that proficiency therein, tremendous as is its importance in furnishing
the Magician with the information necessary to his strategical and
tactical plans, in no wise enables him to accomplish the impossible. It
is not within the scope of divination to predict the future (for
example) with the certainty of an astronomer in calculating the return
of a comet.

> *The astronomer himself has to enter a caveat. He can only calculate
> the probability on the observed facts. Some force might interfere with
> the anticipated movement.*

There is always much virtue in divination; for (Shakespeare assures us!)
there is "much virtue in IF"!

In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment, one must
allow for more than the numerous sources of error inherent in the
process itself. The judgment can do no more than the facts presented to
it warrant. It is naturally impossible in most cases to make sure that
some important factor has not been omitted. In asking, "shall I be wise
to marry?" one leaves it open for wisdom to be defined in divers ways.
One can only expect an answer in the sense of the question. The
connotation of "wise" would then imply the limitations "in your private
definition of wisdom", "in reference to your present circumstances." It
would not involve guarantee against subsequent disaster, or pronounce a
philosophical dictum as to wisdom in the abstract sense. One must not
assume that the oracle is omniscient. By the nature of the case, on the
contrary, it is the utterance of a being whose powers are partial and
limited, though not to such an extent, or in the same directions, as
one's own. But a man who is advised to purchase a certain stock should
not complain if a general panic knocks the bottom out of it a few weeks
later. The advice only referred to the prospects of the stock in itself.
The divination must not be blamed any more than one would blame a man
for buying a house at Ypres there years before the World-War.

As against this, one must insist that it is obviously to the advantage
of the diviner to obtain this information from beings of the most
exalted essence available. An old witch who has a familiar spirit of
merely local celebrity such as the toad in her tree, can hardly expect
him to tell her much more of private matters than her parish magazine
does of public. It depends entirely on the Magician how he is served.
The greater the man, the greater must be his teacher. It follows that
the highest forms of communicating daemons, those who know, so to speak,
the court secrets, disdain to concern themselves with matters which they
regard as beneath them. One must not make the mistake of calling in a
famous physician to one's sick Pekinese. One must also beware of asking
even the cleverest angel a question outside his ambit. A heart
specialist should not prescribe for throat trouble.

The Magician ought therefore to make himself master of several methods
of divination; using one or the other as the purpose of the moment
dictates. He should make a point of organizing a staff of such spirits
to suit various occasions. These should be "familiar"spirits, in the
strict sense; members of his family. He should deal with them
constantly, avoiding whimsical or capricious changes. He should choose
them so that their capacities cover the whole ground of his work; but he
should not multiply them unnecessarily, for he makes himself responsible
for each one that he employs. Such spirits should be ceremonially evoked
to visible or semi-visible appearance. A strict arrangement should be
made and sworn. This must be kept punctiliously by the Magician, and its
infringement by the spirit severely punished. Relations with these
spirits should be confirmed and encouraged by frequent intercourse. They
should be treated with courtesy, consideration, and even affection. They
should be taught to love and respect their master, and to take pride in
being trusted by him.

It is sometimes better to act on the advice of a spirit even when one
knows it to be wrong, though in such a case one must take the proper
precautions against an undesirable result. The reason for this is that
spirits of this type are very sensitive. They suffer agonies of remorse
on realising that they have injured their Master; for he is their God;
they know themselves to be part of him, their aim is to attain to
absorption in him. They understand therefore that his interests are
theirs. Care must be taken to employ none but spirits who are fit for
the purpose, not only by reason of their capacity to supply information,
but for their sympathy with the personality of the Magician. Any attempt
to coerce unwilling spirits is dangerous. They obey from fear; their
fear makes them flatter, and tell amiable falsehoods. It also creates
phantasmal projections of themselves to personate them; and these
phantasms, besides being worthless, become the prey of malicious daemons
who use them to attack the Magician in various ways whose prospect of
success is enhanced by the fact that he has himself created a link with
them.

One more observation seems desirable while on this subject. Divination
of any kind is improper in matters directly concerning the Great Work
itself. In the Knowledge and Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel,
the adept is possessed of all he can possibly need. To consult any other
is to insult one's Angel. Moreover, it is to abandon the only person who
really knows, and really cares, in favour of one who by the nature of
the case, must be ignorant

of the essence of the matter --- one whose interest in it is no more (at
the best) than that of a well-meaning stranger. It should go without
saying that until the Magician has attained to the Knowledge and
Conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel he is liable to endless
deceptions. He does not know Himself; how can he explain his business to
others? How can those others, though they do their best for him, aid in
anything but trifles? One must therefore be prepared for disappointment
at every stage until one attains to adeptship.

This is especially true of divination, because the essence of the horror
of not knowing one's Angel is the utter bewilderment and anguish of the
mind, complicated by the persecution of the body, and envenomed by the
ache of the soul. One puts the wrong questions, and puts them wrong;
gets the wrong answers, judges them wrong, and acts wrongly upon them.
One must nevertheless persist, aspiring with ardour towards one's Angel,
and comforted by the assurance that He is guiding one secretly towards
Himself, and that all one's mistakes are necessary preparations for the
appointed hour of meeting Him. Each mistake is the combing-out of some
tangle in the hair of the bride as she is being coiffed for marriage.

On the other hand, although the adept is in daily communication with his
Angel, he ought to be careful to consult Him only on questions proper to
the dignity of the relation. One should not consult one's Angel on too
many details, or indeed on any matters which come within the office of
one's familiar spirits. One does not go the the King about petty
personal trifles. The romance and rapture of the ineffable union which
constitutes Adeptship must not be profaned by the introduction of
commonplace cares. One must not appear with one's hair in curl-papers,
or complain of the cook's impertinence, if one wants to make the most of
the honeymoon.

> *As the poet puts it; "Psyche, beware how thou disclose Thy tricks of
> toilet to Eros, Or let him learn that those love-breathing Lyrical
> lips that whisper, wreathing His brows with sense-bewitching gold, Are
> equally expert to scold; That those caressing hands will maybe Yet box
> his ears and slap the baby!"*

To the Adept divination becomes therefore a secondary consideration,
although he can now employ it with absolute confidence, and probably use
it with far greater frequency than before his attainment. Indeed, this
is likely in proportion as he learns that resort to divination (on every
occasion when his Will does not instantly instruct him) with implicit
obedience to its counsels careless as to whether or no they may land him
in disaster, is a means admirably efficacious of keeping his mind
untroubled by external impressions, and therefore in the proper
condition to receive the reiterant strokes of rapture with which the
love of his Angel ravishes him.

We have now mapped out the boundaries of possibility and propriety which
define the physical and political geography of divination. The student
must guard himself constantly against supposing that this art affords
any absolute means of discovering "truth", or indeed, of using that word
as if it meant more than the relation of two ideas each of which is
itself as subject to "change without notice" as a musical programme.

Divination, in the nature of things, can do no more than put the mind of
the querent into conscious connection with another mind whose knowledge
of the subject at issue is to his own as that of an expert to a layman.
The expert is not infallible. The client may put his question in a
misleading manner, or even base it on a completely erroneous conception
of the facts. He may misunderstand the expert's answer, and he may
misinterpret its purport. Apart from all this, excluding all error, both
question and answer are limited in validity by their own conditions; and
these conditions are such that truth may cease to be true, either as
time goes on, or if it be flawed by the defect of failure to consider
some circumstances whose concealed operation cancels the contract.

In a word, divination, like any other science, is justified of its
children. It would be extraordinary should so fertile a mother be immune
from still-births, monstrosities, and abortions.

We none of us dismiss our servant science with a kick and a curse every
time the telephone gets out of order. The telephone people make no claim
that it always works and always works right.

> *Except in New York City.*

Divination, with equal modesty, admits that "it often goes wrong; but it
works well enough, all things considered. The science is in its infancy.
All we can do is our best. We no more pretend to infallibility than the
mining expert who considers himself in luck if he hits the bull's eye
four times in ten."

The error of all dogmatists (from the oldest prophet with his
"literally-inspired word of God" to the newest German professor with his
single-track explanation of the Universe) lies in trying to prove too
much, in defending themselves against critics by stretching a probably
excellent theory to include all the facts and the fables, until it
bursts like the overblown bladder it is.

Divination is no more than a rough and ready practical method which we
understand hardly at all, and operate only as empirics. Success for the
best diviner alive is no more certain in any particular instance than a
long putt by a champion golfer. Its calculations are infinitely more
complex than Chess, a Chess played on an infinite board with men whose
moves are indeterminate, and made still more difficult by the
interference of imponderable forces and unformulated laws; while its
conduct demands not only the virtues, themselves rare enough, of
intellectual and moral integrity, but intuition combining delicacy with
strength in such perfection and to such extremes as to make its
existence appear monstrous and miraculous against Nature.

To admit this is not to discredit oracles. On the contrary, the oracles
fell into disrepute just because they pretended to do more than they
could. To divine concerning a matter is little more than to calculate
probabilities. We obtain the use of minds who have access to knowledge
beyond ours, but not to omniscience. HRU, the great angel set over the
Tarot, is beyond us as we are beyond the ant; but, for all we know, the
knowledge of HRU is excelled by some mightier mind in the same
proportion. Nor have we any warrant for accusing HRU of ignorance or
error if we read the Tarot to our own delusion. He may have known, he
may have spoken truly; the fault may lie with our own insight.

The MASTER THERION has observed on innumerable occasions that
divinations, made by him and dismissed as giving untrue answers, have
justified themselves months or years later when he was able to revise
his judgment in perspective, untroubled by his personal passion.

It is indeed surprising how often the most careless divinations give
accurate answers. When things go wrong, it is almost always possible to
trace the error to one's own self-willed and insolent presumption in
insisting that events shall accommodate themselves to our egoism and
vanity. It is comically unscientific to adduce examples of the mistakes
of the diviners as evidence that their art is fatuous. Every one knows
that the simplest chemical experiments often go wrong. Every one knows
the eccentricities of fountain pens; but nobody outside Evangelical
circles makes fun of the Cavendish experiment, or asserts that, if
fountain pens undoubtedly work now and then, their doing so is merely
coincidence.

The fact of the case is that the laws of nature are incomparably more
subtle than even science suspects. The phenomena of every plane are
intimately interwoven. The arguments of Aristotle were dependent on the
atmospheric pressure which prevented his blood from boiling away. There
is nothing in the universe which does not influence every other thing in
one way or another. There is no reason in Nature why the apparently
chance combination of half-a dozen sticks of tortoise-shell should not
be so linked both with the human mind and with the entire structure of
the Universe that the observation of their fall should not enable us to
measure all things in heaven and earth.

With one piece of curved glass we have discovered uncounted galaxies of
suns; with another, endless orders of existence in the infinitesimal.
With the prism we have analysed light so that matter and force have
become intelligible only as forms of light. With a rod we have summoned
the invisible energies of electricity to be our familiar spirit serving
us to do our Will, whether it be to outsoar the condor, or to dive
deeper into the demon world of disease than any of our dreamers dared to
dream.

Since with four bits of common glass mankind has learnt to know so much,
achieved so much, who dare deny that the Book of Thoth, the
quintessentialized wisdom of our ancestors whose civilizations, perished
though they be, have left monuments which dwarf ours until we wonder
whether we are degenerate from them, or evolved from Simians, who dare
deny that such a book may be possessed of unimaginable powers?

It is not so long since the methods of modern science were scoffed at by
the whole cultured world. In the sacred halls themselves the roofs rang
loud with the scornful laughter of the high priests as each new
postulant approached with his unorthodox offering. There is hardly a
scientific discovery in history which was not decried as quackery by the
very men whose own achievements were scarce yet recognized by the world
at large.

Within the memory of the present generation, the possibility of
aeroplanes was derisively denied by those very engineers accounted most
expert to give their opinions.

The method of divination, the "ratio" of it, is as obscure to-day as was
that of spectrum analysis a generation ago. That the chemical
composition of the fixed stars should become known to man seemed an
insane imagining too ridiculous to discuss. To-day it seems equally
irrational to enquire of the desert sand concerning the fate of empires.
Yet surely it, if any one knows, should know!

To-day it may sound impossible for inanimate objects to reveal the
inmost secrets of mankind and nature. We cannot say why divination is
valid. We cannot trace the process by which it performs it marvels.

But the same objections apply equally well to the telephone. No man
knows what electricity is, or the nature of the forces which determine
its action. We know only that by doing certain things we get certain
results, and that the least error on our part will bring our work to
naught. The same is exactly true of divination. The difference between
the two sciences is not more than this: that, more minds having been at
work on the former we have learnt to master its tricks with greater
success than in the case of the latter.
