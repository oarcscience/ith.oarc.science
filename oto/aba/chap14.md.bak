## CHAPTER XIV OF THE CONSECRATIONS: WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE NATURE AND NURTURE OF THE MAGICAL LINK.

### I

Consecration is the active dedication of a thing to a single purpose.
Banishing prevents its use for any other purpose, but it remains inert
until consecrated. Purification is performed by water, and banishing by
air, whose weapon is the sword. Consecration is performed by fire,
usually symbolised by the holy lamp.

> *The general conception is that the three active elements co-operate
> to affect earth; but earth itself may be employed as an instrument.
> Its function is solidification. The use of the Pentacle is indeed very
> necessary in some types of operation, especially those whose object
> involves manifestation in matter, and the fixation in (more or less)
> permanent form of the subtle forces of Nature.*

In most extant magical rituals the two operations are performed at once;
or (at least) the banishing has the more important place, and greater
pains seem to be taken with it; but as the student advances to Adeptship
the banishing will diminish in importance, for it will no longer be so
necessary. The Circle of the Magician will have been perfected by his
habit of Magical work. In the truest sense of that word, he will never
step outside the Circle during his whole life. But the consecration,
being the application of a positive force, can always be raised to a
closer approximation to perfection. Complete success in banishing is
soon attained; but there can be no completeness in the advance to
holiness.

The method of consecration is very simple. Take the wand, or the holy
oil, and draw upon the object to be consecrated the supreme symbol of
the force to which you dedicate it. Confirm this dedication in words,
invoking the appropriate God to indwell that pure temple which you have
prepared for Him. Do this with fervour and love, as if to balance the
icy detachment which is the proper mental attitude for banishing.

> *The Hebrew legends furnish us with the reason for the respective
> virtues of water and fire. The world was purified by water at the
> Deluge, and will be consecrated by fire at the last Judgment. Not
> until that is finished can the "real ceremony" begin.*

The words of purification are: Asperges me, Therion, hyssopo, et
mundabor; lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.

Those of consecration are: Accendat in nobis Therion ignem sui amoris et
flammam aeternae caritatis.

> *These may now advantageously be replaced by (a) "... pure will,
> unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way
> perfect." (CCXX, I, 44) to banish; and (b) "I am uplifted in thine
> heart; and the kisses of the stars rain hard upon thy body." (CCXX,
> II, 62) to consecrate. For the Book of the Law contains the Supreme
> Spells.*

These, as initiates of the VII Degree of O.T.O. are aware, mean more
than appears.

### II

It is a strange circumstance that no Magical writer has hitherto treated
the immensely important subject of the Magical Link. It might almost be
called the Missing Link. It has apparently always been taken for
granted, only lay writers on Magick like Dr. J. G. Frazer have accorded
the subject its full importance.

Let us try to make considerations of the nature of Magick in a strictly
scientific spirit, as well as, deprived of the guidance of antiquity, we
may.

What is a Magical Operation? It may be defined as any event in nature
which is brought to pass by Will. We must not exclude potato-growing or
banking from our definition.

Let us take a very simple example of a Magical Act: that of a man
blowing his nose. What are the conditions of the success of the
Operation? Firstly, that the man's Will should be to blow his nose;
secondly, that he should have a nose capable of being blown; thirdly,
that he should have at command an apparatus capable of expressing his
spiritual Will in terms of material force, and applying that force to
the object which he desires to affect. His Will may be as strong and
concentrated as that of Jupiter, and his nose may be totally incapable
of resistance; but unless the link is made by the use of his nerves and
muscles in accordance with psychological, physiological, and physical
law, the nose will remain unblown through all eternity.

Writers of Magick have been unsparing in their efforts to instruct us in
the preparation of the Will, but they seem to have imagined that no
further precaution was necessary. There is a striking case of an
epidemic of this error whose history is familiar to everybody. I refer
to Christian Science, and the cognate doctrines of "mental healing" and
the like. The theory of such people, stripped of dogmatic furbelows, is
perfectly good Magic of its kind, its negroid kind. The idea is correct
enough: matter is an illusion created by Will through mind, and
consequently susceptible of alteration at the behest of its creator. But
the practice has been lacking. They have not developed a scientific
technique for applying the Will. It is as if they expected the steam of
Watts' kettle to convey people from place to place without the trouble
of inventing and using locomotives.

Let us apply these considerations to Magick in its restricted sense, the
sense in which it was always understood until the Master Therion
extended it to cover the entire operations of Nature.

What is the theory implied in such rituals as those of the Goetia? What
does the Magician do? He applies himself to invoke a God, and this God
compels the appearance of a spirit whose function is to perform the Will
of the magician at the moment. There is no trace of what may be called
machinery in the method. The exorcist hardly takes the pains of
preparing a material basis for the spirit to incarnate except the bare
connection of himself with his sigil. It is apparently assumed that the
spirit already possesses the means of working on matter. The conception
seems to be that of a schoolboy who asks his father to tell the butler
to do something for him. In other words, the theory is grossly
animistic. The savage tribes described by Frazer had a far more
scientific theory. The same may be said of witches, who appear to have
been wiser than the thaumaturgists who despised them. They at least made
waxen images --- identified by baptism --- of the people they wished to
control. They at least used appropriate bases for Magical
manifestations, such as blood and other vehicles of animal force, with
those of vegetable virtue such as herbs. They were also careful to put
their bewitched products into actual contact --- material or astral ---
with their victims. The classical exorcists, on the contrary, for all
their learning, were careless about this essential condition. They acted
as stupidly as people who should write business letters and omit to post
them.

It is not too much to say that this failure to understand the conditions
of success accounts for the discredit into which Magick fell until
Eliphas Levi undertook the task of re-habilitating it two generations
ago. But even he (profoundly as he studied, and luminously as he
expounded, the nature of Magick considered as a universal formula) paid
no attention whatever to that question of the Magical Link, though he
everywhere implies that it is essential to the Work. He evaded the
question by making the "petitio principii" of assigning to the Astral
Light the power of transmitting vibrations of all kinds. He nowhere
enters into detail as to how its effects are produced. He does not
inform us as to the qualitative or quantitative laws of this light. (The
scientifically trained student will observe the analogy between Levi's
postulate and that of ordinary science "in re" the luminiferous ether.)

It is deplorable that nobody should have recorded in a systematic form
the results of our investigations of the Astral Light. We have no
account of its properties or of the laws which obtain in its sphere. Yet
these are sufficiently remarkable. We may briefly notice that, in the
Astral Light, two or more objects can occupy the same space at the same
time without interfering with each other or losing their outlines.

In that Light, objects can change their appearance completely without
suffering change of Nature. The same thing can reveal itself in an
infinite number of different aspects; in fact, it identifies itself by
so doing, much as a writer or a painter reveals himself in a succession
of novels or pictures, each of which is wholly himself and nothing else,
but himself under varied conditions, though each appears utterly
different from its fellows. In that Light one is "swift without feet and
flying without wings"; one can travel without moving, and communicate
without conventional means of expression. One is insensible to heat,
cold, pain, and other forms of apprehension, at least in the shapes
which are familiar to us in our bodily vehicles. They exist, but they
are appreciated by us, and they affect us, in a different manner. In the
Astral Light we are bound by what is, superficially, an entirely
different series of laws. We meet with obstacles of a strange and subtle
character; and we overcome them by an energy and cunning of an order
entirely alien to that which serves us in earthly life. In that Light,
symbols are not conventions but realities, yet (on the contrary) the
beings whom we encounter are only symbols of the realities of our own
nature. Our operations in that Light are really the adventures of our
own personified thoughts. The universe is a projection of ourselves; an
image as unreal as that of our faces in a mirror, yet, like that face,
the necessary form of expression thereof, not to be altered save as we
alter ourselves.

The mirror may be distorted, dull, clouded, or cracked; and to this
extent, the reflection of ourselves may be false even in respect of its
symbolic presentation. In that Light, therefore, all that we do is to
discover ourselves by means of a sequence of hieroglyphics, and the
changes which we apparently operate are in an objective sense illusions.

But the Light servers us in this way. It enables us to see ourselves,
and therefore to aid us to initiate ourselves by showing us what we are
doing. In the same way a watchmaker uses a lens, though it exaggerates
and thus falsifies the image of the system of wheels which he is trying
to adjust. In the same way, a writer employs arbitrary characters
according to a meaningless convention in order to enable his reader by
retranslating them to obtain an approximation to his idea.

Such are a few of the principal characteristics Astral Light. Its
quantitative laws are much less dissimilar from those of material
physics. Magicians have too often been foolish enough to suppose that
all classes of Magical Operations were equally easy. They seem to have
assumed that the "almighty power of God" was an infinite quantity in
presence of which all finites were equally insignificant. "One day is
with the Lord as a thousand years" is their first law of Motion. "Faith
can move mountains" they say, and disdain to measure either the faith or
the mountains. If you can kill a chicken by Magick, why not destroy an
army with equal exertion? "With God all things are possible."

This absurdity is an error of the same class as that mentioned above.
The facts are wholly opposed. Two and two make four in the Astral as
rigorously as anywhere else. The distance of one's Magical target and
the accuracy of one's Magical rifle are factors in the success of one's
Magical shooting in just the same way as at Bisley. The law of Magical
gravitation is as rigid as that of Newton. The law of Inverse Squares
may not apply; but some such law does apply. So it is for everything.
You cannot produce a thunderstorm unless the materials exist in the air
at the time, and a Magician who could make rain in Cumberland might fail
lamentably in the Sahara. One might make a talisman to win the love of a
shop-girl and find it work, yet be baffled in the case of a countess; or
vice versa. One might impose one's Will on a farm, and be crushed by
that of a city; or vice versa. The MASTER THERION himself, with all his
successes in every kind of Magick, sometimes appears utterly impotent to
perform feats which almost any amateur might do, because He has matched
his Will against that of the world, having undertaken the Work of a
Magus to establish the word of His Law on the whole of mankind. He will
succeed, without doubt, but He hardly expects to see more than a sample
of His product during His present incarnation. But He refuses to waste
the least fraction of His force on works foreign to His WORK, however
obvious it may seem to the onlooker that His advantage lies in
commanding stones to become bread, or otherwise making things easy for
Himself.

These considerations being thoroughly understood we may return to the
question of making the Magical Link. In the case above cited FRATER
PERDURABO composed His talisman by invoking His Holy Guardian Angel
according to the Sacred Magick of Abramelin the Mage. That Angel wrote
on the lamen the Word of the Aeon. The Book of the Law is this writing.
To this lamen the Master Therion gave life by devoting His own life
thereto. We may then regard this talisman, the Law, as the most powerful
that has been made in the world's history, for previous talismans of the
same type have been limited in their scope by conditions of race and
country. Mohammed's talisman, Allah, was good only from Persia to the
Pillars of Hercules. The Buddha's, Anatta, operated only in the South
and East of Asia. The new talisman, Thelema, is master of the planet.

But now observe how the question of the Magical Link arises! No matter
how mighty the truth of Thelema, it cannot prevail unless it is applied
to any by mankind. As long as the Book of the Law was in Manuscript, it
could only affect the small group amongst whom it was circulated. It had
to be put into action by the Magical Operation of publishing it. When
this was done, it was done without proper perfection. Its commands as to
how the work ought to be done were not wholly obeyed. There were doubt
and repugnance in FRATER PERDURABO's mind, and they hampered His work.
He was half-hearted. Yet, even so then intrinsic power of the truth of
the Law and the impact of the publication were sufficient to shake the
world so that a critical war broke out, and the minds of men were moved
in a mysterious manner. The second blow was struck by the re-publication
of the Book in September 1913, and this time the might of this Magick
burst out and caused a catastrophe to civilization. At this hour, the
MASTER THERION is concealed, collecting his forces for a final blow.
When The Book of the Law and its Comment is published, with the forces
of His whole Will in perfect obedience to the instructions which have up
to now been misunderstood or neglected, the result will be incalculably
effective. The event will establish the kingdom of the Crowned and
Conquering Child over the whole earth, and all men shall bow to the Law,
which is "love under will".

This is an extreme case; but there is one law only to govern the small
as the great. The same laws describe and measure the motions of the ant
and the stars. Their light is no swifter than that of a spark. In every
operation of Magick the link must be properly made. The first requisite
is the acquisition of adequate force of the kind required for the
purpose. We must have electricity of a certain potential in sufficient
amount if we wish to heat food in a furnace. We shall need a more
intense current and a greater supply to light a city than to charge a
telephone wire. No other kind of force will do. We cannot use the force
of steam directly to impel an aeroplane, or to get drunk. We must apply
it in adequate strength in an appropriate manner.

It is therefore absurd to invoke the spirit of Venus to procure us the
love of an Empress, unless we take measures to transmit the influence of
our work to the lady. We may for example consecrate a letter expressing
our Will; or, if we know how, we may use some object connected with the
person whose acts we are attempting to control, such as a lock of hair
or a handkerchief once belonging to her, and so in subtile connection
with her aura. But for material ends it is better to have material
means. We must not rely on fine gut in trolling for salmon. Our will to
kill a tiger is poorly conveyed by a charge of small shot fired at a
range of one hundred yards. Our talisman must, therefore, be an object
suitable to the nature of our Operation, and we must have some such
means of applying its force to such a way as will naturally compel the
obedience of the portion of Nature which we are trying to change. If one
will the death of a sinner, it is not sufficient to hate him, even if we
grant that the vibrations of thought, when sufficiently powerful and
pure, may modify the Astral light sufficiently to impress its intention
to a certain extent on such people as happen to be sensitive. It is much
surer to use one's mind and muscle in service of that hate by devising
and making a dagger, and then applying the dagger to the heart of one's
enemy. One must give one's hate a bodily form of the same order as that
which one's enemy has taken for his manifestation. Your spirit can only
come into contact with his by means of this magical manufacture of
phantoms; in the same way, one can only measure one's mind (a certain
part of it) against another man's by expressing them in some such form
as the game of chess. One cannot use chessmen against another man unless
he agree to use them in the same sense as you do. The board and men form
the Magical Link by which you can prove your power to constrain him to
yield. The game is a device by which you force him to turn down his king
in surrender, a muscular act made in obedience to your will, thought he
may be twice your weight and strength.

These general principles should enable the student to understand the
nature of the work of making the Magical Link. It is impossible to give
detailed instructions, because every case demands separate
consideration. It is sometimes exceedingly difficult to devise proper
measures.

Remember that Magick includes all acts soever. Anything may serve as a
Magical weapon. To impose one's Will on a nation, for instance, one's
talisman may be a newspaper, one's triangle a church, or one's circle a
Club. To win a woman, one's pantacle may be a necklace; to discover a
treasure, one's wand may be a dramatist's pen, or one's incantation a
popular song.

Many ends, many means: it is only important to remember the essence of
the operation, which is to will its success with sufficiently pure
intensity, and to incarnate that will in a body suitable to express it,
a body such that its impact on the bodily expression of the idea one
wills to change is to cause it to do so. For instance, is it my will to
become a famous physician? I banish all "hostile spirits" such as
laziness, alien interests, and confliction pleasures, from my "circle"
the hospital; I consecrate my "weapons" (my various abilities) to the
study of medicine; I invoke the "Gods" (medical authorities) by studying
and obeying their laws in their books. I embody the "Formulae" (the ways
in which causes and effects influence disease) in a "Ritual" (my
personal style of constraining sickness to conform with my will). I
persist in these conjurations year after year, making the Magical
gestures of healing the sick, until I compel the visible appearance of
the Spirit of Time, and make him acknowledge me his master. I have used
the appropriate kind of means, in adequate measure, and applied them in
ways pertinent to my purpose by projecting my incorporeal idea of
ambition in a course of action such as to induce in others the
incorporeal idea of satisfying mine. I made my Will manifest to sense;
sense swayed the Wills of my fellowmen; mind wrought on mind through
matter.

I did not "sit for" a medical baronetcy by wishing I had it, or by an
"act of faith", or by praying to God "to move Pharaoh's heart", as our
modern mental, or our mediaeval, mystic, miracle-mongers were and are
muddlers and maudlin enough to advise us to do.

A few general observations on the Magical Link may not be amiss, in
default of details; one cannot make a Manual of How to Go Courting, with
an Open-Sesame to each particular Brigand's Cavern, any more than one
can furnish a budding burglar with a directory containing the
combination of every existing safe. But one can point out the broad
distinctions between women who yield, some to flattery, some to
eloquence, some to appearance, some to rank, some to wealth, some to
ardour, and some to authority. We cannot exhaust the combinations of
Lover's Chess, but we may enumerate the principal gambits: the Bouquet,
the Chocolates, the Little Dinner, the Cheque-Book, the Poem, the Motor
by Moonlight, the Marriage Certificate, the Whip, and the Feigned
Flight.

The Magical Link may be classified under three main heads; as it
involves (1) one plane and one person, (2) one plane and two or more
persons, (3) two planes.

In class (1) the machinery of Magick --- the instrument --- already
exists. Thus, I may wish to heal my own body, increase my own energy;
develop my own mental powers, or inspire my own imagination. Here the
Exorcist and the Demon are already connected, consciously or
subconsciously, by an excellent system of symbols. The Will is furnished
by Nature with an apparatus adequately equipped to convey and execute
its orders.

It is only necessary to inflame the Will to the proper pitch and to
issue its commands; they are instantly obeyed, unless --- as in the case
of organic disease --- the apparatus is damaged beyond the art of Nature
to repair. It may be necessary in such a case to assist the internal
"spirits" by the "purification" of medicines, the "banishing" of diet,
or some other extraneous means.

But at least there is no need of any special device "ad hoc" to effect
contact between the Circle and the Triangle. Operations of this class
are therefore often successful, even when the Magician has little or no
technical knowledge of Magick. Almost any duffer can "pull himself
together", devote himself to study, break off a bad habit, or conquer a
cowardice. This class of work, although the easiest, is yet the most
important; for it includes initiation itself in its highest sense. It
extends to the Absolute in every dimension; it involves the most
intimate analysis, and the most comprehensive synthesis. In a sense, it
is the sole type of Magick either necessary or proper to the Adept; for
it includes both the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel, and the Adventure of the Abyss.

The second class includes all operations by which the Magician strives
to impose his Will upon objects outside his own control, but within that
of such other wills as are symbolised by means of a system similar to
his own. That is, they can be compelled naturally by cognate
consciousness.

For instance, one may wish to obtain the knowledge put forth in this
book. Not knowing that such a book exists, one might yet induce some one
who knows of it to offer a copy. Thus one's operation would consist in
inflaming one's Will to possess the knowledge to the point of devoting
one's life to it, in expressing that will by seeking out people who seem
likely to know what is needed, and in imposing it on them by exhibiting
such enthusiastic earnestness that they will tell the enquirer that this
book will meet his needs.

Does this sound too simple? Can this obvious common-sense course be
really that marvellous Magick that frightens folk so? Yes, even this
triviality is one instance of how Magick works.

But the above practical programme may be a fiasco. One might then resort
to Magick in the conventional sense of the word, by constructing and
charging a Pantacle appropriate to the object; this Pantacle should then
cause a strain in the Astral Light such that the vibrations would compel
some alien consciousness to restore equilibrium by bringing the book.

Suppose a severer and more serious aim; suppose that I wish to win a
woman who dislikes me and loves somebody else. In this case, not only
her Will, but her lover's must be overcome by my own. I have no direct
control of either. But my Will is in touch with the woman's by means of
our minds; I have only to make my mind the master of hers by the
existing means of communication; her mind will then present its
recantation to her Will, her Will repeal its decision, and her body
submit to mine as the seal of her surrender.

Here the Magical Link exists; only it is complex instead of simple as in
the First Class.

There is opportunity for all kinds of error in the transmission of the
Will; misunderstanding may mar the matter; a mood may make mischief;
external events may interfere; the lover may match me in Magick; the
Operation itself may offend nature in many ways; for instance, if there
is a subconscious incompatibility between myself and the woman, I
deceive myself into thinking that I desire her. Such a flaw is enough to
bring the whole operation to naught, just as no effort of Will can make
oil mix with water.

I may work "naturally" by wooing, of course. But, magically, I may
attack her astrally so that her aura becomes uneasy, responding no
longer to her lover. Unless they diagnose the cause, a quarrel may
result, and the woman's bewildered and hungry Body of Light may turn in
its distress to that of the Magician who has mastered it.

Take a third case of this class 2. I wish to recover my watch, snatched
from me in a crowd.

Here I have no direct means of control over the muscles that could bring
back my watch, or over the mind that moves these muscles. I am not even
able to inform that mind of my Will, for I do not know where it is. But
I know it to be a mind fundamentally like my own, and I try to make a
Magical Link with it by advertising my loss in the hope of reaching it,
being careful to calm it by promising it immunity, and to appeal to its
own known motive by offering a reward. I also attempt to use the
opposite formula; to reach it by sending my "familiar spirits", the
police, to hunt it, and compel its obedience by threats.

> *The ceremonial method would be to transfer to the watch --- linked
> naturally to me by possession and use --- a thought calculated to
> terrify the thief, and induce him to get rid of it at once. Observing
> clairsentiently this effect, suggest relief and reward as the result
> of restoring it.*

Again, a sorcerer might happen to possess an object belonging magically
to a rich man, such as a compromising letter, which is really as much
part of him as his liver; he may then master the will of that man by
intimidating his mind. His power to publish the letter is as effective
as if he could injure the man's body directly.

These "natural" cases may be transposed into subtler terms; for
instance, one might master another man, even a stranger, by sheer
concentration of will, ceremonially or otherwise wrought up to the
requisite potential. But in one way or another that will must be made to
impinge on the man; by the normal means of contact if possible, if not,
by attacking some sensitive spot in his subconscious sensorium. But the
heaviest rod will not land the smallest fish unless there be a line of
some sort fixed firmly to both.

The Third Class is characterized by the absence of any existing link
between the Will of the Magician and that controlling the object to be
affected. (The Second Class may approximate to the Third when there is
no possibility of approaching the second mind by normal means, as
sometimes happens).

This class of operations demands not only immense knowledge of the
technique of Magick combined with tremendous vigour and skill, but a
degree of Mystical attainment which is exceedingly rare, and when found
is usually marked by an absolute apathy on the subject of any attempt to
achieve any Magick at all. Suppose that I wish to produce a
thunderstorm. This event is beyond my control or that of any other man;
it is as useless to work on their minds as my own. Nature is independent
of, and indifferent to, man's affairs. A storm is caused by atmospheric
conditions on a scale so enormous that the united efforts of all us
Earth-vermin could scarcely disperse one cloud, even if we could get at
it. How then can any Magician, he who is above all things a knower of
Nature, be so absurd as to attempt to throw the Hammer of Thor? Unless
he be simply insane, he must be initiated in a Truth which transcends
the apparent facts. He must be aware that all nature is a continuum, so
that his mind and body are consubstantial with the storm, are equally
expressions of One Existence, all alike of the self-same order of
artifices whereby the Absolute appreciates itself. He must also have
assimilated the fact that the Quantity is just as much a form as
Quality; that as all things are modes of One Substance, so their
measures are modes of their relation. Not only are gold and lead mere
letters, meaningless in themselves yet appointed to spell the One Name;
but the difference between the bulk of a mountain and that of a mouse is
no more than one method of differentiating them, just as the letter "m"
is not bigger than the letter "i" in any real sense of the word.

> *Professor Rutherford thinks it not theoretically impracticable to

> rest to disintegrate explosively.*

Our Magician, with this in his mind, will most probably leave
thunderstorms to stew in their own juice; but, should he decide (after
all) to enliven the afternoon, he will work in the manner following.

First, what are the elements necessary for his storms? He must have
certain stores of electrical force, and the right kind of clouds to
contain it.

He must see that the force does not leak away to earth quietly and
slyly.

He must arrange a stress so severe as to become at last so intolerable
that it will disrupt explosively.

Now he, as a man, cannot pray to God to cause them, for the Gods are but
names for the forces of Nature themselves.

But, "as a Mystic", he knows that all things are phantoms of One Thing,
and that they may be withdrawn therein to reissue in other attire. He
knows that all things are in himself, and that he is All-One with the
All. There is therefore no theoretical difficulty about converting the
illusion of a clear sky into that of a tempest. On the other hand, he is
aware, "as a Magician", that illusions are governed by the laws of their
nature. He knows that twice two is four, although both "two" and "four"
are merely properties pertaining to One. He can only use the Mystical
identity of all things in a strictly scientific sense. It is true that
his experience of clear skies and storms proves that his nature contains
elements cognate with both; for it not, they could not affect him. He is
the Microcosm of his own Macrocosm, whether or no either one or the
other extend beyond his knowledge of them. He must therefore arouse in
himself those ideas which are clansmen of the Thunderstorm, collect all
available objects of the same nature for talismans, and proceed to
excite all these to the utmost by a Magical ceremony; that is, by
insisting on their godhead, so that they flame within and without him,
his ideas vitalising the talismans. There is thus a vivid vibration of
high potential in a certain group of sympathetic substances and forces;
and this spreads as do the waves from a stone thrown into a lake,
widening and weakening; till the disturbance is compensated. Just as a
handful of fanatics, insane with one over-emphasised truth, may infect a
whole country for a time by inflaming that thought in their neighbours,
so the Magician creates a commotion by disturbing the balance of power.
He transmits his particular vibration as a radio operator does with his
ray; rate-relation determines exclusive selection.

In practice, the Magician must "evoke the spirits of the storm" by
identifying himself with the ideas of which atmospheric phenomena are
the expressions as his humanity is of him; thus achieved, he must impose
his Will upon them by virtue of the superiority of his intelligence and
the integration of his purpose to their undirected impulses and
uncomprehending interplay.

All such Magick demands the utmost precision in practice. It is true
that the best rituals give us instructions in selecting our vehicles of
force. In 777 we find "correspondences" of many classes of being with
the various types of operation, so that we know what weapons, jewels,
figures, drugs, perfumes, names, etc. to employ in any particular work.
But it has always been assumed that the invoked force is intelligent and
competent, that it will direct itself as desired without further ado, by
this method of sympathetic vibrations.

The necessity of timing the force has been ignored; and so most
operations, even when well performed as far as invocation goes, are as
harmless as igniting loose gunpowder.

But, even allowing that Will is sufficient to determine the direction,
and prevent the dispersion of the force, we can hardly be sure that it
will act on its object, unless that object be properly prepared to
receive it. The Link must be perfectly made. The object must possess in
itself a sufficiency of stuff sympathetic to our work. We cannot make
love to a brick, or set an oak to run errands.

We see, then, that we can never affect anything outside ourselves save
only as it is also within us. Whatever I do to another, I do also to
myself. If I kill a man, I destroy my own life at the same time. That is
the magical meaning of the so-called "Golden Rule", which should not be
in the imperative but in the indicative mood. Every vibration awakens
all others of its particular pitch.

There is thus some justification for the assumption of previous writers
on Magick that the Link is implicit, and needs no special attention.
Yet, in practice, there is nothing more certain than that one ought to
confirm one's will by all possible acts on all possible planes. The
ceremony must not be confined to the formally magical rites. We must
neglect no means to our end, neither despising our common sense, nor
doubting our secret wisdom.

When Frater I. A. was in danger of death in 1899 e.v. Frater V. N. and
FRATER PERDURABO did indeed invoke the spirit Buer to visible
manifestation that the might heal their brother; but also one of them
furnished the money to send him to a climate less cruel than England's.
He is alive to day

> *P.S. He died some months after this passage was written: but he had

; who cares whether spirits or shekels wrought that which these
Magicians willed?

Let the Magical Link be made strong! It is "love under will"; it affirms
the identity of the Equation of the work; it makes success Necessity.
