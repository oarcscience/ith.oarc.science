## CHAPTER XII OF THE BLOODY SACRIFICE: AND MATTERS COGNATE.

It is necessary for us to consider carefully the problems connected with
the bloody sacrifice, for this question is indeed traditionally
important in Magick. Nigh all ancient Magick revolves around this
matter. In particular all the Osirian religions --- the rites of the
Dying God --- refer to this. The slaying of Osiris and Adonis; the
mutilation of Attis; the cults of Mexico and Peru; the story of Hercules
or Melcarth; the legends of Dionysus and of Mithra, are all connected
with this one idea. In the Hebrew religion we find the same thing
inculcated. The first ethical lesson in the Bible is that the only
sacrifice pleasing to the Lord is the sacrifice of blood; Abel, who made
this, finding favour with the Lord, while Cain, who offered cabbages,
was rather naturally considered a cheap sport. The idea recurs again and
again. We have the sacrifice of the Passover, following on the story of
Abraham's being commanded to sacrifice his firstborn son, with the idea
of the substitution of animal for human life. The annual ceremony of the
two goats carries out this in perpetuity. And we see again the
domination of this idea in the romance of Esther, where Haman and
Mordecai are the two goats or gods; and ultimately in the presentation
of the rite of Purim in Palestine, where Jesus and Barabbas happened to
be the Goats in that particular year of which we hear so much, without
agreement on the date.

This subject must be studied in the "Golden Bough", where it is most
learnedly set forth by Dr. J. G. Frazer. Enough has now been said to
show that the bloody sacrifice has from time immemorial been the most
considered part of Magick. The ethics of the thing appear to have
concerned no one; nor, to tell the truth, need they do so. As St. Paul
says, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"; and who are we
to argue with St. Paul? But, after all that, it is open to any one to
have any opinion that he likes upon the subject, or any other subject,
thank God! At the same time, it is most necessary to study the business,
whatever we may be going to do about it; for our ethics themselves will
naturally depend upon our theory of the universe. If we were quite
certain, for example, that everybody went to heaven when he died, there
could be no serious objection to murder or suicide, as it is generally
conceded --- by those who know neither --- that earth is not such a
pleasant place as heaven.

However, there is a mystery concealed in this theory of the bloody
sacrifice which is of great importance to the student, and we therefore
make no further apology, We should not have made even this apology for
an apology, had it not been for the solicitude of a pious young friend
of great austerity of character who insisted that the part of this
chapter which now follows --- the part which was originally written ---
might cause us to be misunderstood. This must not be. The blood is the
life. This simple statement is explained by the Hindus by saying that
the blood is the principal vehicle of vital Prana.

> subtle energy. The prana of the body is only one of its "vayus". Vayu
> means air or spirit. The idea is that all bodily forces are

There is some ground for the belief that there is a definite substance

, not isolated as yet, whose presence makes all the difference between
live and dead matter. We pass by with deserved contempt the
pseudo-scientific experiments of American charlatans who claim to have
established that weight is lost at the moment of death, and the
unsupported statements of alleged clairvoyants that they have seen the
soul issuing like a vapour from the mouth of persons "in articulo
mortis"; but his experiences as an explorer have convinced the Master
Therion that meat loses a notable portion of its nutritive value within
a very few minutes after the death of the animal, and that this loss
proceeds with ever-diminishing rapidity as time goes on. It is further
generally conceded that live food, such as oysters, is the most rapidly
assimilable and most concentrated form of energy.

> *Once can become actually drunk on oysters, by chewing them

Laboratory experiments in food-values seem to be almost worthless, for
reasons which we cannot here enter into; the general testimony of
mankind appears a safer guide.

It would be unwise to condemn as irrational the practice of those
savages who tear the heart and liver from an adversary, and devour them
while yet warm. In any case it was the theory of the ancient Magicians,
that any living being is a storehouse of energy varying in quantity
according to the size and health of the animal, and in quality according
to its mental and moral character. At the death of the animal this
energy is liberated suddenly.

The animal should therefore be killed

> *It is a mistake to suppose that the victim is injured. On the

within the Circle, or the Triangle, as the case may be, so that its
energy cannot escape. An animal should be selected whose nature accords
with that of the ceremony --- thus, by sacrificing a female lamb one
would not obtain any appreciate quantity of the fierce energy useful to
a Magician who was invoking Mars. In such a case a ram

> *A wolf would be still better in the case of Mars. See 777 for the
> correspondences between various animals and the "32 Paths" of Nature.*

would be more suitable. And this ram should be virgin --- the whole
potential of its original total energy should not have been diminished
in any way.

> *There is also the question of its magical freedom. Sexual intercourse
> creates a link between its exponents, and therefore a responsibility.*

For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that
victim which contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of
perfect innocence and high intelligence

> this particular sacrifice on an average about 150 times every year

is the most satisfactory and suitable victim.

For evocations it would be more convenient to place the blood of the
victim in the Triangle --- the idea being that the spirit might obtain
from the blood this subtle but physical substance which was the
quintessence of its life in such a manner as to enable it to take on a
visible and tangible shape.

Those magicians who abject to the use of blood have endeavored to
replace it with incense. For such a purpose the incense of Abramelin may
be burnt in large quantities. Dittany of Crete is also a valuable
medium. Both these incenses are very catholic in their nature, and
suitable for almost any materialization.

But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious;
and for nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best. The truly great
Magician will be able to use his own blood, or possibly that of a
disciple, and that without sacrificing the physical life irrevocably.

An example of this sacrifice is given in Chapter 44 of Liber 333. This
Mass may be recommended generally for daily practice.

One last word on this subject. There is a Magical operation of maximum
importance: the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary to
utter a Word, the whole Planet must be bathed in blood. Before man is
ready to accept the Law of Thelema, the Great War must be fought. This
Bloody Sacrifice is the critical point of the World-Ceremony of the
Proclamation of Horus, the Crowned and conquering Child, as Lord of the
Aeon.

> three years before its fulfilment.*

This whole matter is prophesied in the Book of the Law itself; let the
student take note, and enter the ranks of the Host of the Sun.

### II

There is another sacrifice with regard to which the Adepts have always
maintained the most profound secrecy. It is the supreme mystery of
practical Magick. Its name is the Formula of the Rosy Cross. In this
case the victim is always --- in a certain sense --- the Magician
himself, and the sacrifice must coincide with the utterance of the most
sublime and secret name of the God whom he wishes to invoke.

Properly performed, it never fails of its effect. But it is difficult
for the beginner to do it satisfactorily, because it is a great effort
for the mind to remain concentrated upon the purpose of the ceremony.
The overcoming of this difficulty lends most powerful aid to the
Magician.

It is unwise for him to attempt it until he has received regular
initiation in the true

Order of the Rosy Cross, and he must have taken the vows with the
fullest comprehension and experience of their meaning. It is also
extremely desirable that he should have attained an absolute degree of
moral emancipation

> *This results from the full acceptance of the Law of THELEMA,
> persistently put into practice.*

, and that purity of spirit which results from a perfect understanding
both of the differences and harmonies of the planes upon the Tree of
Life.

For this reason FRATER PERDURABO has never dared to use this formula in
a fully ceremonial manner, save once only, on an occasion of tremendous
import, when, indeed, it was not He that made the offering, but ONE in
Him. For he perceived a grave defect in his moral character which he has
been able to overcome on the intellectual plane, but not hitherto upon
higher planes. Before the conclusion of writing this book he will have
done so.

> *P.S. With the happiest results. P.*

The practical details of the Bloody Sacrifice may be studied in various
ethnological manuals, but the general conclusions are summed up in
Frazer's "Golden Bough", which is strongly recommended to the reader.
Actual ceremonial details likewise may be left to experiment. The method
of killing is practically uniform. The animal should be stabbed to the
heart, or its throat severed, in either case by the knife. All other
methods of killing are less efficacious; even in the case of Crucifixion
death is given by stabbing.

> *Yet one might devise methods of execution appropriate to the Weapons:
> Stabbing or clubbing for the Lance or Wand, Drowning or poisoning for
> the Cup, Beheading for the Sword, Crushing for the Disk, Burning for
> the Lamp, and so forth.*

One may remark that warm-blooded animals only are used as victims: with
two principal exceptions. The first is the serpent, which is only used
in a very special Ritual;

> vessel; and it issues in due season refreshed and modified, but still
> essentially itself. The idea is the transmission of life and wisdom

the second the magical beetles of Liber Legis. (See Part IV.)

One word of warning is perhaps necessary for the beginner. The victim
must be in perfect health --- or its energy may be as it were poisoned.
It must also not be too large:

> *The sacrifice (e.g.) of a bull is sufficient for a large number of
> people; hence it is commonly made in public ceremonies, and in some
> initiations, e.g. that of a King, who needs force for his whole
> kingdom. Or again, in the Consecration of a Temple.*
>
> See Lord Dunsany, "The Blessing of Pan" --- a noble and most notable
> prophecy of Life's fair future.

the amount of energy disengaged is almost unimaginably great, and out of
all anticipated proportion to the strength of the animal. Consequently,
the Magician may easily be overwhelmed and obsessed by the force which
he has let loose; it will then probably manifest itself in its lowest
and most objectionable form. The most intense spirituality of purpose

> "bad" by definition. Nothing is in itself good or evil. The shields of
> the Sabines which crushed Tarpeia were not murderous to them, but the
> contrary. Her criticism of them was simply that they were what she did
> not want in her Operation.*

is absolutely essential to safety.

In evocations the danger is not so great, as the Circle forms a
protection; but the circle in such a case must be protected, not only by
the names of God and the Invocations used at the same time, but by a
long habit of successful defence.

If you are easily disturbed or alarmed, or if you have not yet overcome
the tendency of the mind to wander, it is not advisable for you to
perform the "Bloody Sacrifice".

Yet it should not be forgotten that this, and that other art at which we
have dared darkly to hint, are the supreme formulae of Practical Magick.

You are also likely to get into trouble over this chapter unless you
truly comprehend its meaning.
