## CHAPTER IX OF SILENCE AND SECRECY: AND OF THE BARBAROUS NAMES OF EVOCATION.

It is found by experience (confirming the statement of Zoroaster) that
the most potent conjurations are those in an ancient and perhaps
forgotten language, or even those couched in a corrupt and possibly
always meaningless jargon. Of these there are several main types. The
"preliminary invocation" in the "Goetia" consists principally of
corruptions of Greek and Egyptian names. For example, we find
"Osorronnophris" for "Asor Un-Nefer".

> *See appendix 4, Liber Samekh; this is an edition of this Invocation,
> with an elaborate Rubric, translation, scholia, and instruction.*
>
> {WEH ADDENDUM: This is the "Preliminary Invocation" placed in the

> is itself a small portion of the "Lemegeton" or "Lesser Key of
> Solomon." This "Preliminary Evocation" is altered in Liber Samekh over
> that published in the "Goetia".

The conjurations given by Dr. Dee (vide Equinox I, VIII) are in a
language called Angelic, or Enochian. Its source has hitherto baffled
research, but it is a language and not a jargon, for it possesses a
structure of its own, and there are traces of grammar and syntax.

However this may be, it "works". Even the beginner finds that "things
happen" when he uses it: and this is an advantage --- or disadvantage!
---- shared by no other type of language,. The rest need skill. This
needs Prudence!

The Egyptian Invocations are much purer, but their meaning has not been
sufficiently studied by persons magically competent. We possess a number
of Invocations in Greek of every degree of excellence; in Latin but few,
and those of inferior quality. It will be noticed that in every case the
conjurations are very sonorous, and there is a certain magical voice in
which they should be recited. This special voice was a natural gift of
the Master Therion; but it can be easily taught --- to the right people.

Various considerations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the
English language. There already existed one example, the charm of the
witches in Macbeth; although this was perhaps not meant seriously, its
effect is indubitable.

> *A true poet cannot help revealing himself and the truth of things in
> his art, whether he be aware of what he is writing, or no.*

He has found iambic tetrameters enriched with many rimes both internal
an external very useful. "The Wizard Way" (Equinox I,I) gives a good
idea of the sort of thing. So does the Evocation of Bartzabel in Equinox
I,IX. There are many extant invocations throughout his works, in many
kinds of metre, of many kinds of being, and for many kinds of purposes.
(See Appendix).

Other methods of incantation are on record as efficacious. For instance
Frater I.A., when a child, was told that he could invoke the devil by
repeating the "Lord's Prayer" backwards. He went into the garden and did
so. The Devil appeared, and almost scared him out of his life.

It is therefore not quite certain in what the efficacy of conjurations
really lies. The peculiar mental excitement required may even be aroused
by the perception of the absurdity of the process, and the persistence
in it, as when once FRATER PERDURABO (at the end of His magical
resources) recited "From Greenland's Icy Mountains", and obtained His
result.

> *See "Eleusis", A. Crowley, "Collected Works", Vol. III Epilogue.*

It may be conceded in any case that the long strings of formidable words
which roar and moan through so many conjurations have a real effect in
exalting the consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch --- that
they should do so is no more extraordinary than music of any kind should
do so.

Magicians have not confined themselves to the use of the human voice.
The Pan-pipe with its seven stops, corresponding to the seven planets,
the bull-roarer, the tom-tom, and even the violin, have all been used,
as well as many others, of which the most important is the bell

> *See Part II. It should be said that in experience no bell save His
> own Tibetan bell of Electrum Magicum has ever sounded satisfactory to
> the Master Therion. Most bells jar and repel.*

, though this is used not so much for actual conjuration as to mark
stages in the ceremony. Of all these the tom-tom will be found to be the
most generally useful.

While on the subject of barbarous names of evocation we should not omit
the utterance of certain supreme words which enshrine (alpha) the
complete formula of the God invoked, or (beta) the whole ceremony.

Examples of the former kind are Tetragrammaton, I.A.O., and Abrahadabra.

An example of the latter kind is the great word StiBeTTChePhMeFSHiSS,
which is a line drawn on the Tree of Life (Coptic attributions) in a
certain manner.

> *It represents the descent of a certain Influence. See the Evocation
> of Taphtatharath, Equinox I, III. The attributions are given in 777.
> This Word expresses the current Kether - Beth - Binah - Cheth -
> Geburach - Mem - Hod - Shin - Malkuth, the descent from 1 to 10 via
> the Pillar of Severity.*

With all such words it is of the utmost importance that they should
never be spoken until the supreme moment, and even then they should
burst from the magician almost despite himself --- so great should be
his reluctance

> *This reluctance is Freudian, due to the power of these words to
> awaken the suppressed subconscious libido.*

to utter them. In fact, they should be the utterance of the God in him
at the first onset of the divine possession. So uttered, they cannot
fail of effect, for they have become the effect.

Every wise magician will have constructed (according to the principles
of the Holy Qabalah) many such words, and he should have
quintessentialised them all in one Word, which last Word, once he has
formed it, he should never utter consciously even in thought, until
perhaps with it he gives up the ghost. Such a Word should in fact be so
potent that man cannot hear it and live.

Such a word was indeed the lost Tetragrammaton

> *The Master Therion has received this Word; it is communicated by Him
> to the proper postulants, at the proper time and place, in the proper
> circumstances.*

. It is said that at the utterance of this name the Universe crashes
into dissolution. Let the Magician earnestly seek this Lost Word, for
its pronunciation is synonymous with the accomplishment of the Great
Work.

> *Each man has a different Great Work, just as no two points on the
> circumference of a circle are connected with the centre by the same
> radius. The Word will be correspondingly unique.*

In this matter of the efficacity of words there are again two formulae
exactly opposite in nature. A word may become potent and terrible by
virtue of constant repetition. It is in this way that most religions
gain strength. At first the statement "So and so is God" excites no
interest. Continue, and you meet scorn and scepticism: possibly
persecution. Continue, and the controversy has so far died out that no
one troubles to contradict your assertion.

No superstition is so dangerous and so lively as an exploded
superstition. The newspapers of to-day (written and edited almost
exclusively by men without a spark of either religion or morality) dare
not hint that any one disbelieves in the ostensibly prevailing cult;
they deplore Atheism --- all but universal in practice and implicit in
the theory of practically all intelligent people --- as if it were the
eccentricity of a few negligible or objectionable persons. This is the
ordinary story of advertisement; the sham has exactly the same chance as
the real. Persistence is the only quality required for success.

The opposite formula is that of secrecy. An idea is perpetuated because
it must never be mentioned. A freemason never forgets the secret words
entrusted to him, thought these words mean absolutely nothing to him, in
the vast majority of cases; the only reason for this is that he has been
forbidden to mention them, although they have been published again and
again, and are as accessible to the profane as to the initiate.

In such a work of practical Magick as the preaching of a new Law, these
methods may be advantageously combined; on the one hand infinite
frankness and readiness to communicate all secrets; on the other the
sublime and terrible knowledge that all real secrets are incommunicable.

> *If this were not the case, individuality would not be inviolable. No

> fallacious.*

It is, according to tradition, a certain advantage in conjurations to
employ more than one language. In all probability the reason of this is
than any change spurs the flagging attention. A man engaged in intense
mental labour will frequently stop and walk up and down the room --- one
may suppose for this cause --- but it is a sign of weakness that this
should be necessary. For the beginner in Magick, however, it is
permissible

> *This is not to say that it is advisable. O how shameful is human
> weakness! But it does encourage one --- it is useless to deny it ---
> to be knocked down by a Demon of whose existence one was not really
> quite sure.*

to employ any device to secure the result.

Conjurations should be recited, not read:

> *Even this is for the weaker brethern. The really great Magus speaks
> and acts impromptu and extempore.*

and the entire ceremony should be so perfectly performed that one is
hardly conscious of any effort of memory. The ceremony should be
constructed with such logical fatality that a mistake is impossible.

> *First-rate poetry is easily memorized because the ideas and the
> musical values correspond to man's mental and sensory structure.*

The conscious ego of the Magician is to be destroyed to be absorbed in
that of the God whom he invokes, and the process should not interfere
with the automation who is performing the ceremony.

But this ego of which it is here spoken is the true ultimate ego. The
automaton should possess will, energy, intelligence, reason, and
resource. This automaton should be the perfect man far more than any
other man can be. It is only the divine self within the man, a self as
far above the possession of will or any other qualities whatsoever as
the heavens are high above the earth, that should reabsorb itself into
that illimitable radiance of which it is a spark.

> *This is said of the partial or lesser Works of Magick. This is an
> elementary treatise; one cannot discuss higher Works as for example
> those of "The Hermit of Aesopus Island".*

The great difficulty for the single Magician is so to perfect himself
that these multifarious duties of the Ritual are adequately performed.
At first he will find that the exaltation destroys memory and paralyses
muscle. This is an essential difficulty of the magical process, and can
only be overcome by practice and experience.

> *See "The Book of Lies"; there are several chapters on this subject.
> But Right exaltation should produce spontaneously the proper mental
> and physical reactions. As soon as the development is secured, there
> will be automatic reflex "justesse", exactly as in normal affairs mind
> and body respond with free unconscious rightness to the Will.*

In order to aid concentration, and to increase the supply of Energy, it
has been customary for the Magician to employ assistants or colleagues.
It is doubtful whether the obvious advantages of this plan compensate
the difficulty of procuring suitable persons

, and the chance of a conflict of will or a misunderstanding in the
circle itself. On one occasion FRATER PERDURABO was disobeyed by an
assistant, and had it not been for His promptitude in using the physical
compulsion of the sword, it is probable that the circle would have been
broken. As it was, the affair fortunately terminated in nothing more
serious than the destruction of the culprit.

However, there is no doubt that an assemblage of persons who really are
in harmony can much more easily produce an effect than a magician
working by himself. The psychology of "Revival meetings" will be
familiar to almost every one, and though such meetings

> *See, for an account of properly-conducted congregational ceremonial,
> Equinox I, IX. "Energized Enthusiasm", and Equinox III, L. Liber XV,
> Ecclesiae Gnosticae Catholicae Cannon Missae. The "Revival meetings"
> here in question were deliberate exploitations of religious hysteria.*

are the foulest and most degraded rituals of black magic, the laws of
Magick are not thereby suspended. The laws of Magick are the laws of
Nature.

A singular and world-famous example of this is of sufficiently recent
date to be fresh in the memory of many people now living. At a nigger
camp meeting in the "United" States of America, devotees were worked up
to such a pitch of excitement that the whole assembly developed a
furious form of hysteria. The comparatively intelligible cries of
"Glory" and "Hallelujah" no longer expressed the situation. Somebody
screamed out "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!", and this was taken up by the whole
meeting and yelled continuously, until reaction set in. The affair got
into the papers, and some particularly bright disciple of John Stuart
Mill, logician and economist, thought that these words, having set one
set of fools crazy, might do the same to all the other fools in the
world. He accordingly wrote a song, and produced the desired result.
This is the most notorious example of recent times of the power exerted
by a barbarous name of evocation.

A few words may be useful to reconcile the general notion of Causality
with that of Magick. How can we be sure that a person waving a stick and
howling thereby produces thunderstorms? In no other way than that
familiar to Science; we note that whenever we put a lighted match to dry
gunpowder, an unintelligibly arbitrary phenomenon, that of sound, is
observed; and so forth.

We need not dwell upon this point; but it seems worth while to answer
one of the objections to the possibility of Magick, chosing one which is
at first sight of an obviously "fatal" character. It is convenient to
quote verbatim from the Diary

> *In a later entry we read that the diarist has found a similar train
> of argument in "Space, Time, and Gravitation", page 51. He was much

> of thought.*

of a distinguished Magician and philosopher. "I have noticed that the
effect of a Magical Work has followed it so closely that it must have
been started before the time of the Work. E.g. I work to-night to make X
in Paris write to me. I get the letter the next morning, so that it must
have been written before the Work. Does this deny that the Work caused
the effect?

"If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, both my will and its motion
are due to causes long antecedent to the act. I may consider both my
Work and its reaction as twin effects of the eternal Universe. The moved
arm and ball are parts of a state of the Cosmos which resulted
necessarily from its momentarily previous state, and so, back for ever.
"Thus, my Magical Work is only one of the cause-effects necessarily
concomitant with the case-effects which set the ball in motion. I may
therefore regard the act of striking as a cause-effect of my original
Will to move the ball, though necessarily previous to its motion. But
the case of magical Work is not quite analogous. For my nature is such
that I am compelled to perform Magick in order to make my will to
prevail; so that the cause of my doing the Work is also the cause of the
ball's motion, and there is no reason why one should precede the other.
(CF. "Lewis Carroll," where the Red Queen screams before she pricks her
finger.)

"Let me illustrate the theory by an actual example.

"I write from Italy to a man in France and another in Australia on the
same day, telling them to join me. Both arrive ten days later; the first
in answer to my letter, which he received, the second on "his own
initiative", as it would seem. But I summoned him because I wanted him;
and I wanted him because he was my representative; and his intelligence
made him resolve to join me because it judged rightly that the situation
(so far as he knew it) was such as to make me desire his presence.

"The same cause, therefore, which made me write to him made him come to
me; and though it would be improper to say that the writing of the
letter was the direct cause of his arrival, it is evident that if I had
not written I should have been different from what I actually am, and
therefore my relations with him would have been otherwise than they are.
In this sense, therefore, the letter and the journey are causally
connected.

"One cannot go farther, and say that in this case I ought to write the
letter even if he had arrived before I did so; for it is part of the
whole set of circumstance that I do not use a crowbar on an open door.
"The conclusion is that one should do one's Will 'without lust of
result'. If one is working in accordance with the laws of one's own
nature, one is doing 'right'; and no such work can be criticised as
'useless', even in cases of the character here discussed. So long as
one's Will prevails, there is no cause for complaint.

"To abandon one's Magick would shew lack of self-confidence in one's
powers, and doubt as to one's inmost faith in Self and in Nature.

> the desired effects. For if one possesses the inclination to do

> said myself. "Who hath the How is careless of the Why".*

Of course one changes one's methods as experience indicates; but there
is no need to change them on any such ground as the above.

"Further, the argument here set forth disposes of the need to explain
the "modus operandi" of Magick. A successful operation does not involve
any theory soever, not even that of the existence of causality itself.
The whole set of phenomena may be conceived as single.

"For instance, if I see a star (as it was years ago) I need not assume
causal relations as existing between it, the earth, and myself. The
connexion exists; I can predicate nothing beyond that. I cannot
postulate purpose, or even determine the manner in which the event comes
to be. Similarly, when I do Magick, it is in vain to inquire why I so
act, or why the desired result does or does not follow. Nor can I know
how the previous and subsequent conditions are connected. At most I can
describe the consciousness which I interpret as a picture of the facts,
and make empirical generalizations of the superficial aspects of the
case.

"Thus, I have my own personal impressions of the act of telephoning; but
I cannot be aware of what consciousness, electricity, mechanics, sound,
etc., actually are in themselves. And although I can appeal to
experience to lay down 'laws' as to what conditions accompany the act, I
can never be sure that they have always been, or ever will again be,
identical. (In fact, it is certain that an event can never occur twice
in precisely the same circumstances.)

> *If it did so, how could we call it duplex?*

"Further, my 'laws; must always take nearly all the more important
elements of knowledge for granted. I cannot say --- finally --- how an
electric current is generated. I cannot be sure that some totally
unsuspected force is not at work in some entirely arbitrary way. For
example, it was formerly supposed that Hydrogen and Chlorine would unite
when an electric spark was passed through the mixture; now we 'know'
that the presence of a minute quantity of aqueous vapour (or some
tertium quid) is essential to the reaction. We formulated before the
days of Ross the 'laws' of malarial fever, without reference to the
mosquito; we might discover one day that the germ is only active when
certain events are transpiring in some nebula

> relation; so that we cannot possibly be sure that we may deny:
> "Malarial fever is a function of the present precession of the
> Equinoxes".*

, or when so apparently inert a substance as Argon is present in the air
in certain proportions.

"We may therefore admit quite cheerfully that Magick is as mysterious as
mathematics, as empirical as poetry, as uncertain as golf, and as
dependent on the personal equation as Love.

"That is no reason why we should not study, practice and enjoy it; for
it is a Science in exactly the same sense as biology; it is no less an
Art that Sculpture; and it is a Sport as much as Mountaineering.

"Indeed, there seems to be no undue presumption in urging that no
Science possesses equal possibilities of deep and important Knowledge;

that no Art offers such opportunities to the ambition of the Soul to
express its Truth, in Ecstasy, through Beauty; and that no Sport rivals
its fascinations of danger and delight, so excites, exercises, and tests
its devotees to the uttermost, or so rewards them by well-being, pride,
and the passionate pleasures of personal triumph.

"Magick takes every thought and act for its apparatus; it has the
Universe for its Library and its Laboratory; all Nature is its Subject;
and its Game, free from close seasons and protective restrictions,
always abounds in infinite variety, being all that exists.
