## CHAPTER XVII OF THE LICENSE TO DEPART

After a ceremony has reached its climax, anti-climax must inevitably
follow. But if the ceremony has been successful this anti-climax is
merely formal. The Magician should rest permanently on the higher plain
to which he has aspired.

> *The rock-climber who relaxes on the face of the precipice falls to
> earth; but once he has reached a safe ledge he may sit down.*

The whole force of the operation should be absorbed; but there is almost
certain to be a residuum, since no operation is perfect: and (even if it
were so) there would be a number of things, sympathetic to the
operation, attracted to the Circle. These must be duly dispersed, or
they will degenerate and become evil. It is always easy to do this where
invocations are concerned; the mere removal of the strain imposed by the
will of the magician will restore things to their normal aspects, in
accordance with the great law of inertia. In a badly-managed evocation,
however, this does not always obtain; the spirit may refuse to be
controlled, and may refuse to depart --- even after having sworn
obedience. In such a case extreme danger may arise.

In the ordinary way, the Magician dismisses the spirit with these words:
"And now I say unto thee, depart in peace unto thine habitations and
abodes --- and may the blessing of the Highest be upon thee in the name
of (here mention the divine name suitable to the operation, or a Name
appropriate to redeem that spirit); and let there be peace between thee
and me; and be thou very ready to come, whensoever thou are invoked and
called!"

> *It is usual to add "either by a word, or by a will, or by this mighty
> Conjuration of Magick Art."*

Should he fail to disappear immediately, it is a sign that there is
something very wrong. The Magician should immediately reconsecrate the
Circle with the utmost care. He should then repeat the dismissal; and if
this does not suffice, he should then perform the banishing ritual
suitable to the nature of the spirit and, if necessary, add conjurations
to the same effect. In these circumstances, or if anything else
suspicious should occur, he should not be content with the apparent
disappearance of the spirit, who might easily make himself invisible and
lie in ambush to do the Magician a mischief when he stepped out of the
Circle --- or even months afterwards.

Any symbol which has once definitely entered your environment with your
own consent is extremely dangerous; unless under absolute control. A
man's friends are more capable of working him harm than are strangers;
and his greatest danger lies in his own habits.

Of course it is the very condition of progress to build up ideas into
the subconscious. The necessity of selection should therefore be
obvious.

True, there comes a time when all elements soever must be thus
assimilated. Samadhi is, by definition, that very process. But, from the
point of view of the young magician, there is a right way --- strait and
difficult --- of performing all this. One cannot too frequently repeat
that what is lawful and proper to one Path is alien to another.

Immediately after the License to Depart, and the general closing up of
the work, it is necessary that the Magician should sit down and write up
his magical record. However much he may have been tired

> *He ought to be refreshed, more than after a full night's deep sleep.
> This forms one test of his skill.*

by the ceremony, he ought to force himself to do this until it becomes a
habit. Verily, it is better to fail in the magical ceremony than to fail
in writing down an accurate record of it. One need not doubt the
propriety of this remark. Even if one is eaten alive by Malkah
be-Tarshishim ve-Ruachoth ha-Schehalim, it does not matter very much,
for it is over so very quickly. But the record of the transactions is
otherwise important. Nobody cares about Duncan having been murdered by
Macbeth. It is only one of a number of similar murders. But
Shakespeare's account of the incident is a unique treasure of mankind.
And, apart from the question of the value to others, there is that of
the value to the magician himself. The record of the magician is his
best asset.

It is as foolish to do Magick without method, as if it were anything
else. To do Magick without keeping a record is like trying to run a
business without book-keeping. There are a great many people who quite
misunderstand the nature of Magick. They have an idea that it is
something vague and unreal, instead of being, as it is, a direct means
of coming into contact with reality. It is these people who pay
themselves with phrases, who are always using long words with no
definite connotation, who plaster themselves with pompous titles and
decorations which mean nothing whatever. With such people we have
nothing to do. But to those who seek reality the Key of Magick is
offered, and they are hereby warned that the key to the treasure-house
is no good without the combination; and the combination is the magical
record.

From one point of view, magical progress actually consists in
deciphering one's own record.

> *As one is a Star in the Body of Nuith, every successive incarnation
> is a Veil, and the acquisition of the Magical Memory a gradual
> Unveiling of that Star, of that God.*

For this reason it is the most important thing to do, on strictly
magical grounds. But apart from this, it is absolutely essential that
the record should be clear, full and concise, because it is only by such
a record that your teacher can judge how it is best to help you. Your
magical teacher has something else to do besides running around after
you all the time, and the most important of all his functions is that of
auditor. Now, if you call in an auditor to investigate a business, and
when he asks for the books you tell him that you have not thought it
worth while to keep any, you need not be surprised if he thinks you
every kind of an ass.

It is --- at least, it was --- perfectly incredible to THE MASTER
THERION that people who exhibit ordinary common sense in the other
affairs of life should lose it completely when they tackle Magick. It
goes far to justify the belief of the semi-educated that Magick is
rather a crazy affair after all. However, there are none of these
half-baked lunatics connected with the A.'. A.'., because the necessity
for hard work, for passing examinations at stated intervals, and for
keeping an intelligible account of what they are doing, frightens away
the unintelligent, idle and hysterical.

There are numerous models of magical and mystical records to be found in
the various numbers of the "Equinox", and the student will have no
difficulty in acquiring the necessary technique, if he be diligent in
practice.
