## CHAPTER XV

### I OF THE INVOCATION

In the straightforward or "Protestant" system of Magick there is very
little to add to what has already been said. The Magician addresses a
direct petition to the Being invoked. But the secret of success in
invocation has not hitherto been disclosed. It is an exceedingly simple
one. It is practically of no importance whatever that the invocation
should be "right". There are a thousand different ways of compassing the
end proposed, so far as external things are concerned. The whole secret
may be summarised in these four words: "Enflame thyself in praying."

> *This is Qabalistically expressed in the old Formula: Domine noster,
> audi tuo servo! kyrie Christe! O Christe!*

The mind must be exalted until it loses consciousness of self. The
Magician must be carried forward blindly by a force which, though in him
and of him, is by no means that which he in his normal state of
consciousness calls I. Just as the poet, the lover, the artist, is
carried out of himself in a creative frenzy, so must it be for the
Magician.

It is impossible to lay down rules for the obtaining of this special
stimulus. To one the mystery of the whole ceremony may appeal; another
may be moved by the strangeness of the words, even by the fact that the
"barbarous names" are unintelligible to him. Some times in the course of
a ceremony the true meaning of some barbarous name that has hitherto
baffled his analysis may flash upon him, luminous and splendid, so that
he is caught up unto orgasm. The smell of a particular incense may
excite him effectively, or perhaps the physical ecstasy of the magick
dance.

Every Magician must compose his ceremony in such a manner as to produce
a dramatic cilmax. At the moment when the excitement becomes
ungovernable, when then the whole conscious being of the Magician
undergoes a spiritual spasm, at that moment must he utter the supreme
adjuration.

One very effective method is to stop short, by a supreme effort of will,
again and again, on the very brink of that spasm, until a time arrives
when the idea of exercising that will fails to occur

> *This forgetfulness must be complete; it is fatal to try to "let
> oneself go" consciously.*

. Inhibition is no longer possible or even thinkable, and the whole
being of the Magician, no minutest atom saying nay, is irresistibly
flung forth. In blinding light, amid the roar of ten thousand thunders,
the Union of God and man is consummated.

If the Magician is still seen standing in the Circle, quietly pursuing
his invocations, it is that all the conscious part of him has become
detached from the true ego which lies behind that normal consciousness.
But the circle is wholly filled with that divine essence; all else is
but an accident and an illusion.

The subsequent invocations, the gradual development and materialization
of the force, require no effort. It is one great mistake of the beginner
to concentrate his force upon the actual stated purpose of the ceremony.
This mistake is the most frequent cause of failures in invocation.

A corollary of this Theorem is that the Magician soon discards evocation
almost altogether --- only rare circumstances demand any action what
ever on the material plane. The Magician devotes himself entirely to the
invocation of a god; and as soon as his balance approaches perfection he
ceases to invoke any partial god; only that god vertically above him is
in his path. And so a man who perhaps took up Magick merely with the
idea of acquiring knowledge, love, or wealth, finds himself irrevocably
committed to the performance of *The Great Work.*

It will now be apparent that there is no distinction between magick and
meditation except of the most arbitrary and accidental kind.

> comes bubbling to my brim; Life and Death are one to Him!".*

### II

Beside these open methods thee are also a number of mental methods of
Invocation, of which we may give three.

The first method concerns the so-called astral body. The Magician should
practise the formation of this body as recommended in Liber O, and learn
to rise on the planes according to the instruction given in the same
book, though limiting his "rising" to the particular symbol whose God he
wishes to invoke.

The second is to recite a mantra suitable to the God.

The third is the assumption of the form of the God --- by transmuting
the astral body into His shape. This last method is really essential to
all proper invocation, and cannot be too sedulously practised.

There are many other devices to aid invocation, so many that it is
impossible to enumerate them; and the Magician will be wise to busy
himself in inventing new ones.

We will give one example.

Suppose the Supreme Invocation to consist of 20 to 30 barbarous names,
let him imagine these names to occupy sections of a vertical column,
each double the length of the preceding one; and let him imagine that
his consciousness ascends the column with each name. The mere
multiplication will then produce a feeling of awe and bewilderment which
is the proper forerunner of exstasy.

Kundalini. This essay should be studied with care and determination.
