Hear Me: -

the Firmament and of the Ether: upon the Earth and under the Earth: on
dry Land and in the Water: of Whirling Air, and of rushing Fire: and
every Spell and Scourge of God may be obedient unto Me.

\(1\) See, for the formula of IAF, or rather FIAOF, Book 4 Part III,
Chapter V. The form FIAOF will be found preferable in practice.

Section E.  
Earth

I invoke Thee: -

    MA                      "O Mother!  O Truth!"
    BARRAIO                 "Thou Mass!" (1)

*The conception of of Earth, glowing, inhabited by a Solar-Phallic
Hippopotamus (2) of a Venereal nature.*

the Firmament, and of the Ether: upon The Earth and under the Earth: on
dry land and in the Water: of Whirling Air, and of rushing Fire: and
every Spell and Scourge of God may be obedient unto Me.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(1)"Mass", in the sense of the word which is used by physicists. The
impossibility of defining it will not deter the intrepid initiate (in
view of the fact that the fundamental conception is beyond the normal
categories of reason.)  
(2)Sacred to AHAThOOR. The idea is that of the Female conceived as
invulnerable, reposeful, of enormous swallowing capacity etc.

Section F.

Hear Me:

                               thus symbolizing the whole course of
                               spiritual life.  A is the formless Hero;
                               U is the six-fold solar sound of physical
                               life, the triangle of Soul being
                               entwined with that of Body; M is the
                               silence of "death"; GN is the nasal
                               sound of generation & knowledge.
    ISAK                    "Identical Point!"

                               Hail, IAO!"

Section Ff.

1.  This is the Lord of the Gods:
2.  This is the Lord of the Universe:
3.  This is He whom the Winds fear.
4.  This is He, Who having made Voice by His commandment is Lord of all
    Things; King, Ruler and Helper. Hear Me, and make all Spirits
    subject unto Me: so that every Spirit of the Firmament and of the
    Ether: upon the Earth and under the Earth: on dry Land and in the
    Water: of Whirling Air, and of rushing Fire: and every Spell and

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(1)In Hebrew, ADNI, 65. The Gnostic Initiates transliterated it to imply
their own secret formulae; we follow so excellent an example. ON is an
Arcanum of Arcana; its significance is taught, gradually, in the O.T.O.
Also AD is the paternal formula, Hadit; ON is its complement NUIT; the
final Yod signifies "mine" etymologically and essentially the Mercurial
(transmitted) hermaphroditic virginal seed - The Hermit of the Taro -
The use of the name is therefore to invoke one's own inmost secrecy,
considered as the result of the conjunction of Nuit and Hadit. If the
second A is included, its import is to affirm the operation of the Holy
Ghost and the formulation of the Babe in the Egg, which precedes the
appearance of the Hermit.  
(2)A thorough comprehension of Psycho-analysis will contribute notably
to the proper appreciation of this Ritual.  
(3)It is said among men that the word Hell deriveth from the word
"helan", to hele or conceal, in the tongue of the Anglo-Saxons. That is,
it is the concealed place, which since all things are in thine own self,
is the unconscious, *Liber CXI (Aleph) chap. Delta-Zeta*  
(4)But compare the use of the same word in section C.

The Attainment

1.  I am He! the Bornless Spirit! having sight in the feet: Strong, and
    the Immortal Fire!
2.  I am He! the Truth!
3.  I am He! Who hate that evil should be wrought in the World!
4.  I am He, that lighteneth and thundereth!
5.  I am He, from whom is the Shower of the Life of Earth!
6.  I am He, whose mouth ever flameth!
7.  I am He, the Begetter and Manifester unto the Light!
8.  I am He, The Grace of the Worlds!
9.  "The Heart Girt with a Serpent" is my name!

Section H.  
The "Charge to the Spirit"

Come thou forth, and follow me: and make all Spirits subject unto Me so
that every Spirit of the Firmament, and of the Ether, upon the Earth and
under the Earth: on dry Land, or in the Water: of Whirling Air or of
rushing Fire, and every Spell and scourge of God, may be obedient unto
me!

The Proclamation of the Beast 666

IAF:SABAF (1)  
Such are the Words!

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(1)See explanation in Point II.  
  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  

POINT II  
  
*Ars Congressus Cum Daemone*

Section A

Let the Adeptus Minor be standing in this circle on the square of
Tiphereth, armed with his Wand and Cup; but let him perform the Ritual
throughout in his Body of Light. He may burn the Cakes of Light, or the
Incense of Abramelin; he may be prepared by Liber CLXXV, the reading of
Liber LXV, and by the practices of Yoga. He may invoke Hadit by "...
wine and strange drugs" if he so will. (1) He prepares the circle by the
usual formulae of Banishing and Consecration, etc. He recites Section A
as a rehearsal before His Holy Guardian Angel of the attributes of that
Angel. Each phrase must be realized with full concentration of force, so
as to make Samadhi as perfectly as possible upon the truth proclaimed.

Line 1

> He identifies his Angel with the Ain Soph, and the Kether thereof; one
> formulation of Hadit in the boundless Body of Nuith.

Line 2,3,4

> He asserts that His Angel has created (for the purpose of
> self-realization through projection in conditioned Form) three pairs
> of opposites: (a) The Fixed and the Volatile; (b) The Unmanifested and
> the Manifest; and (c) the Unmoved and the Moved. Otherwise, the
> Negative and the Positive in respect of Matter, Mind and Motion.

Line 5

> He acclaims his Angel as "Himself Made Perfect"; adding that this
> Individuality is inscrutable in inviolable. In the Neophyte Ritual of
> G: D: (As it is printed in Equinox I, II, for the old aeon) the
> Hierophant is the perfected Osiris, who brings the candidate, the
> natural Osiris, to identity with himself. But in the new Aeon the
> Hierophant is Horus (Liber CCXX, I, 49) therefore the Candidate will
> be Horus too. What then is the formula of the initiation of Horus? It
> will no longer be that of the Man, through Death. It will be the
> natural growth of the Child. His experiences will no more be regarded
> as catastrophic. Their hieroglyph is the Fool: the innocent and
> impotent Harpocrates Babe becomes the Horus Adult by obtaining the
> Wand. "Der reine Thor" seizes the Sacred Lance. Bacchus becomes Pan.
> The Holy Guardian Angel is the Unconscious Creature Self - the
> Spiritual Phallus. His knowledge and conversation contributes occult
> puberty. It is therefore advisable to replace the name Asar-Un-Nefer
> by that of Ra-Hoor-Khuit at the outset, and by that of one's own Holy
> Guardian Angel when it has been communicated.

Line 6

> He hails Him as BESZ, the Matter that destroys and devours Godhead,
> for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God.

Line 7

> He hails Him as APOPHRASZ, the Motion that destroys and devours
> Godhead, for the purpose of the Incarnation of any God. The combined
> action of these two DEVILS is to allow the God upon whom they prey to
> enter into enjoyment of existence through the Sacrament of dividual
> "Life" (Bread - the flesh of BESZ) and "Love" (Wine - the blood or

Section B

The Adept passes from contemplation to action in the sections now
following B to Gg. He is to travel astrally around the circle, making
the appropriate pentagrams, sigils, and signs. His direction is
widdershins. He thus makes three curves, each covering three-fourths of
the circle. He should give the sign of the Enterer on passing the
Kiblah, or Direction of Boleskine. This picks up the force naturally
radiating from that point (1) and projects it in the direction of the
path of the Magician. The sigils are those given in the Equinox Vol. I,
No. 7, Plate X outside the square; the signs those shewn in Vol. I, No.
2, Plate "The Signs of the Grades". In these invocations he should
expand his girth and his stature to the utmost (2), assuming the form
and the consciousness of the elemental god of the quarter. After this,
he begins to vibrate the "Barbarous Names" of the Ritual.

Now let him not only fill his whole being to the uttermost with the
force of the Names; but let him formulate his Will, understood
thoroughly as the dynamic aspect of his Creative Self, in an appearance
symbolically apt, I say not in the form of a Ray of Light, of a Fiery
Sword, or of aught save that bodily Vehicle of the Holy Ghost which is
sacred to BAPHOMET, by its virtue that concealeth the Lion and the
Serpent that His Image may appear adorably upon the Earth for ever.

Let then the Adept extend his Will beyond the Circle in this imagined
Shape and let it radiate with the Light proper to the element invoked,
and let each Word issue along the Shaft with passionate impulse, as if
its voice gave command thereto that it should thrust itself leapingly
forward. Let also each Word accumulate authority, so that the Head of
the Shaft may plunge twice as far for the Second Word as for the First,
and Four Times for the Third as the Second, and thus to the end.
Moreover, let the Adept fling forth his whole consciousness thither.
Then at the final Word, let him bring rushing back his Will within
himself, steadily streaming, and let him offer himself to its point, as
Artemis to PAN, that this perfectly pure concentration of the Element
purge him thoroughly, and possess him with its passion.

In this Sacrament being wholly at one with that Element, let the Adept
utter the Charge "Hear me, and make", etc. with strong sense that this
unity with that quarter of the Universe confers upon him the fullest
freedom and privilege appurtenant thereto.

Let the Adept take note of the wording of the Charge. The "Firmament" is
the Ruach, the "mental plane"; it is the realm of Shu, or Zeus, where
revolves the Wheel of the Gunas, the Three forms (3) of Being. The
Aethyr is the "akasha", the "Spirit", the Aethyr or physics, which is
the framework on which all forms are founded; it receives, records and
transmits all impulses without itself suffering mutation thereby. The
"Earth" is the sphere wherein the operation of these "fundamental" and
aethyric forces appears to perception. "Under the Earth" is the world of
those phenomena which inform those perceived projections, and determine
their particular character. "Dry land" is the place of dead "material
things", dry (i.e. unknowable) because unable to act on our minds.
"Water" is the vehicle whereby we feel such things; "air" their
menstruum wherein these feelings are mentally apprehended. It is called
"whirling" because of the instability of thought, and the fatuity of
reason, on which we are yet dependent for what we call "life". "Rushing
Fire" is the world in which wandering thought burns up to swift-darting
Will. These four stages explain how the non-Ego is transmuted into the
Ego. A "Spell" of God is any form of consciousness, and a "Scourge" any
form of action.

The Charge, as a whole, demands for the Adept the control of every
detail of the Universe which His Angel has created as a means of
manifesting Himself to Himself. It covers command of the primary
projection of the Possible in individuality, in the antithetical
artifice which is the device of Mind, and in a balanced triplicity of
modes or states of being whose combinations constitute the
characteristics of Cosmos. It includes also a standard of structure, a
rigidity to make reference possible. Upon these foundations of condition
which are not things in themselves, but the canon to which things
conform, is builded the Temple of Being, whose materials are themselves
perfectly mysterious, inscrutable as the Soul, and like the Soul
imagining themselves by symbols which we may feel, perceive, and adapt
to our use without ever knowing the whole Truth about them. The Adept
sums up all these items by claiming authority over every form of
expression possible to Existence, whether it be a "spell" (idea) or a
"scourge" (act) of "God", that is, of himself. The Adept must accept
every "spirit", every "spell", every "scourge", as part of his
environment, and make them all "subject to" himself; that is, consider
them as contributory causes of himself. They have made him what he is.
They correspond exactly to his own faculties. They are all - ultimately
- of equal importance. The fact that he is what he is proves that each
item is equilibrated. The impact of each new impression affects the
entire system in due measure. He must therefore realize that every event
is subject to him. It occurs because he had need of it. Iron rusts
because the molecules demand oxygen for the satisfaction of their
tendencies. They do not crave hydrogen; therefore combination with that
gas is an event which does not happen. All experiences contribute to
make us complete in ourselves. We feel ourselves subject to them so long
as we fail to recognise this; when we do, we perceive that they are
subject to us. And whenever we strive to evade an experience, whatever
it may be, we thereby do wrong to ourselves. We thwart our own
tendencies. To live is to change; and to oppose change is to revolt
against the law which we have enacted to govern our lives. To resent
destiny is thus to abdicate our sovereignty, and to invoke death.
Indeed, we have decreed the doom of death for every breach of the law of
Life. And every failure to incorporate any impression starves that
particular faculty which stood in need of it.

This Section B invokes Air in the East, with a shaft of golden glory.

(3)They correspond to the Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt of Alchemy; to
Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas in the Hindu system; and are rather modes of
action than actual qualities even when conceived as latent. They are the
apparatus of communication between the planes; as such, they are
conventions. There is no absolute validity in any means of mental
apprehension; but unless we make these spirits of the Firmament subject
unto us by establishing right relation (within the possible limits) with
the Universe, we shall fall into error when we develop our new
instrument of direct understanding. It is vital that the Adept should
train his intellectual faculties to tell him the truth, in the measure
of their capacity. To despise the mind on account of its limitations is
the most disastrous blunder; it is the common cause of the calamities
which strew so many shores with the wreckage of the Mystic Armada.
Bigotry, Arrogance, Bewilderment, all forms of mental and moral
disorder, so often observed in people of great spiritual attainment,
have brought the Path itself into discredit; almost all such
catastrophes are due to trying to build the Temple of the Spirit without
proper attention to the mental laws of structure and the physical
necessities of foundation. The mind must be brought to its utmost pitch
of perfection, but according to its own internal properties; one cannot
feed a microscope on mutton chops. It must be regarded as a mechanical
instrument of knowledge, independent of the personality of its
possessor. One must treat it exactly as one treats one's electroscope or
one's eyes; one influence of one's wishes. A physician calls in a
colleague to attend to his own family, knowing that personal anxiety may
derange his judgment. A microscopist who trusts his eyes when his pet
theory is at stake may falsify the facts, and find too late that he has
made a fool of himself.  
In the case of initiations itself, history is scarred with the wounds
inflicted by this Dagger. It reminds us constantly of the danger of
relying upon the intellectual faculties. A judge must know the law in
every point, and be detached from personal prejudices, and
incorruptible, or iniquity will triumph. Dogma, with persecution,
delusion, paralysis of progress, and many another evil, as its satraps,
has always established a tyranny when Genius has proclaimed it. Islam
making a bonfire of written Wisdom, and Haeckel forging biological
evidence; physicists ignorant of radioactivity disputing the conclusions
of geology, and theologians impatient of truth struggling against the
tide of thought; all such must perish at the hands of their own error in
making their minds, internally defective or externally deflected, the
measure of the Universe.

<u>Section F</u>

> spirit, facing toward Boleskine, by the active Pentagrams, the sigil
> called the Mark of the Beast, and the Signs of L.V.X. (See plate as

> Aspiration.

<u>Section Ff</u>

With these words the Adept does not withdraw his will within him as in
the previous Sections. He thinks of them as a reflection of Truth on the
surface of the dew, where his Soul hides trembling. He takes them to be
the first formulation in his consciousness of the nature of His Holy
Guardian Angel.

Line 1  

> The "Gods" include all the conscious elements of his nature.

Line 2  

> The "Universe" includes all possible phenomena of which he can be
> aware.

Line 3  

> The "Winds" are his thoughts, which have prevented him from attaining
> to his Angel.

Line 4  

> His Angel has made "Voice", the magical weapon which produces "Words",
> and these words have been the wisdom by which He hath created all
> things. The "Voice" is necessary as the link between the Adept and his
> Angel. The Angel is "King", the One who "can", the "source of
> authority and the fount of honour"; also the King (or King's Son) who
> delivers the Enchanted Princess, and makes her his Queen. He is
> "Ruler", the "unconscious Will"; to be thwarted no more by the
> ignorant and capricious false will of the conscious man. And He is
> "Helper", the author of the infallible impulse that sends the Soul
> sweeping along the skies on its proper path with such impetus that the
> attraction of alien orbs is no longer sufficient to swerve it. The
> "Hear me" clause is now uttered by the normal human consciousness,
> withdrawn to the physical body; the Adept must deliberately abandon
> his attainment, because it is not yet his whole being which burns up
> before the Beloved.

<u>Section G</u>

The Adept, though withdrawn, shall have maintained the Extension of his
Symbol. He now repeats the signs as before, save that he makes the
Passive Invoking Pentagram of Spirit. He concentrates his consciousness
within his Twin-Symbol of Self, and endeavours to send it to sleep. But
if the operation be performed properly, his Angel shall have accepted
the offering of Dew, and seized with fervour upon the extended symbol of
Will towards Himself. This then shall He shake vehemently with
vibrations of love reverberating with the Words of the Section. Even in
the physical ears of the adept there shall resound an echo thereof, yet
he shall not be able to describe it. It shall seem both louder than
thunder, and softer than the whisper of the night-wind. It shall at once
be inarticulate, and mean more than he hath ever heard.  
  
Now let him strive with all the strength of his Soul to withstand the
Will of his Angel, concealing himself in the closest cell of the citadel
of consciousness. Let him consecrate himself to resist the assault of
the Voice and the Vibration until his consciousness faint away into
Nothing. For if there abide unabsorbed even one single atom of the false
Ego, that atom should stain the virginity of the True Self and profane
the Oath; then that atom should be so inflamed by the approach of the
Angel that is should overwhelm the rest of the mind, tyrannize over it,
and become an insane despot to the total ruin of the realm.  
  
But, all being dead to sense, who then is able to strive against the
Angel? He shall intensify the stress of His Spirit so that His loyal
legions of Lion-Serpents leap from the ambush, awakening the adept to
witness their Will and sweep him with them in their enthusiasm, so that
he consciously partakes this purpose, and sees in its simplicity the
solution of all his perplexities. Thus then shall the Adept be aware
that he is being swept away through the column of his Will Symbol. and
that His Angel is indeed himself, with intimacy so intense as to become
identity, and that not in a single Ego, but in every unconscious element
that shares in that manifold uprush.  
  
This rapture is accompanied by a tempest of brilliant light, almost
always, and also in many cases by an outburst of sound, stupendous and
sublime in all cases, though its character may vary within wide limits.
(1)  
  
The spate of stars shoots from the head of the Will-Symbol, and is
scattered over the sky in glittering galaxies. This dispersion destroys
the concentration of the adept, whose mind cannot master such
multiplicity of majesty; as a rule, he simply sinks stunned into
normality, to recall nothing of his experience but a vague though vivid
impression of complete release and ineffable rapture. Repetition
fortifies him to realise the nature of his attainment; and his Angel,
the link once made, frequents him, and trains him subtly to be sensitive
to his Holy presence, and persuasion. But it may occur, especially after
repeated success, that the Adept is not flung back into his mortality by
the explosion of the Star-spate, but identified with one particular
"Lion-Serpent", continuing conscious thereof until it finds its proper
place in Space, when its secret self flowers forth as a truth, which the
Adept may then take back to earth with him.  
  
This is but a side issue. The main purpose of the Ritual is to establish
the relation of the subconscious self with the Angel in such a way that
the Adept is aware that his Angel is the Unity which expresses the sum
of the Elements of that Self, that his normal consciousness contains
alien enemies introduced by the accidents of environment, and that his
Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel destroys all
doubts and delusions, confers all blessings, teaches all truth, and
contains all delights. But it is important that the Adept should not
rest in mere inexpressible realization of his rapture, but rouse himself
to make the relation submit to analysis, to render it in rational terms,
and thereby enlighten his mind and heart in a sense as superior to
fanatical enthusiasm as Beethoven's music is to West African
war-drums.  
  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(1)These phenomena are not wholly subjective; they may be perceived,
though often under other forms, by even the ordinary man.  
  

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

<u>Section Gg</u>

The adept should have realised that his Act of Union with the angel
implies (1) the death of his old mind save in so far as his unconscious
elements preserve its memory when they absorb it, and (2) the death of
his unconscious elements themselves. But their death is rather a going
forth to renew their life through love. He then, by conscious
comprehension of them separately and together, becomes the "Angel" of
his Angel, as Hermes is the Word of Zeus, whose own voice is Thunder.
Thus in this section the adept utters articulately so far as words may,
what his Angel is to Himself. He says this, with his Scin-Laeca wholly
withdrawn into his physical body, constraining His Angel to indwell his
heart.

Line 1  

> "I am He" asserts the destruction of the sense of separateness between
> self and Self. It affirms existence, but of the third person only.
> "The Bornless Spirit" is free of all space, "having sight in the
> feet", that they may choose their own path. "Strong" is G B R, The
> Magician escorted by the Sun and the Moon (See Liber D and Liber 777).
> The "Immortal Fire" is the creative Self; impersonal energy cannot
> perish, no matter what forms it assumes. Combustion is Love.

Line 2  

> "Truth" is the necessary relation of any two things; therefore,
> although it implies duality, it enables us to conceive of two things
> as being one thing such that it demands to be defined by
> complementals. Thus, an hyperbola is a simple idea, but its
> construction exacts two curves.

Line 3  

> The Angel, as the adept knows him, is a being Tiphereth, which
> obscures Kether. The Adept is not officially aware of the higher
> Sephiroth. He cannot perceive, like the Ipsissimus, that all things
> soever are equally illusion and equally Absolute. He is in Tiphereth,
> whose office is Redemption, and he deplores the events which have
> caused the apparent Sorrow from which he has just escaped. He is also
> aware, even in the height of his ecstasy, of the limits and defects of
> his Attainment.

Line 4  

> This refers to the phenomena which accompany his Attainment.

Line 5  

> This means the recognition of the Angel as the True Self of his
> subconscious self, the hidden Life of his physical life.

Line 6  

> The Adept realises every breath, every word of his Angel as charged
> with creative fire. Tiphereth is the Sun, and the Angel is the
> spiritual Sun of the Soul of the Adept.

Line 7  

> Here is summed the entire process of bringing the conditioned Universe
> to knowledge of itself through the formula of generation (1); a soul
> implants itself in sense-hoodwinked body and reason-fettered mind,
> makes them aware of their Inmate, and thus to partake of its own
> consciousness of the Light.

Line 8  

> "Grace" has here its proper sense of "Pleasantness". The existence of
> the Angel is the justification of the device of creation. (2)

<u>Section H.</u>

This recapitulation demands the going forth together of the Adept and
his Angel "to do their pleasure on the Earth among the living."  
  
<u>Section J.</u>

The Beast 666 having devised the present method of using this Ritual,
having proved it by his own practice to be of infallible puissance when
properly performed, and now having written it down for the world, it
shall be an ornament for the Adept who adopts it to cry Hail to His name
at the end of his work. This shall moreover encourage him in Magick, to
recall that indeed there was One who attained by its use to the
Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel, the which forsook
him no more, but made Him a Magus, the Word of the Aeon of Horus!  
  
For know this, that the Name IAF in its most secret and mighty sense
declareth the Formula of the Magick of the BEAST whereby he wrought many
wonders. And because he doth will that the whole world shall attain to
this Art, He now hideth it herein so that the worthy may win to His
Wisdom.  
  
Let I and F face all (1); yet ward their A from attack. The Hermit to
himself, the fool to foes, The Hierophant to friends, Nine by nature,
Naught by attainment, Five by function. In speech swift, subtle and
secret; in thought creative, unbiassed, unbounded; in act gentle,
patient and persistent.  
  
Hermes to hear, Dionysus to touch, Pan to behold.  
  
A Virgin, A Babe, and a Beast!  
  
A Liar, an Idiot, and a Master of Men!  
  
A kiss, a guffaw, and a bellow; he that hath ears to hear, let him
hear!  
  
Take ten that be one, and one that is one in three, to conceal them in
six!  
  
Thy wand to all Cups, and thy Disk to all Swords, but betray not thine
Egg!  
  
Moreover also is IAF verily 666 by virtue of Number; and this is a
Mystery of Mysteries; Who knoweth it, he is adept of adepts, and Mighty
among Magicians!  
  
Now this word SABAF, being by number Three score and Ten (2), is a name
of Ayin, the Eye, and the Devil our Lord, and the Goat of Mendes. He is
the Lord of the Sabbath of the Adepts, and is Satan, therefore also the
Sun, whose number of Magick is 666, the seal of His servant the BEAST.  
  
But again SA is 61, AIN, the Naught of Nuith; BA means go, for Hadit;
and F is their Son the Sun who is Ra-Hoor-Khuit.  
  
So then let the Adept set his sigil upon all the words he hath writ in
the Book of the Works of his Will.  
  
And let him then end all, saying, Such are the Words! (3) For by this he
maketh proclamation before all them that be about his Circle that these
Words are true and puissant, binding what he would bind, and loosing
what he would loose.  
  
Let the Adept perform this Ritual aright, perfect in every part thereof,
once daily for one moon, then twice, at dawn and dusk, for two moons,
next, thrice, noon added, for three moons, afterwards, midnight making
up his course, for four moons four times every day. Then let the
Eleventh Moon be consecrated wholly to this Work; let him be instant in
continual ardour, dismissing all but his sheer needs to eat and sleep.
(4) For know that the true Formula (5) whose virtue sufficed the Beast
in this Attainment, was thus:  
  

INVOKE OFTEN (6)  
  

So may all men come at last to the Knowledge and Conversation of the
Holy Guardian Angel: thus sayeth the Beast, and prayeth His own Angel
that this book be as a burning Lamp, and as a living Spring, for Light
and Life to them that read therein.  
  

666

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

(1)If we adopt the new orthography VIAOV (Book 4 Part III Chap. V.) we
must read "The Sun-6-the Son" etc. for "all"; and elaborate this
interpretation here given in other ways, accordingly. Thus O (of F) will
not be "The Fifteen by function" instead of "Five" etc., and "in act
free, firm, aspiring, ecstatic", rather than "gentle" etc. as in the
present text.  
(2)There is an alternative spelling TzBA-F Where the Root, (ABz) "an
Host", has the value of 93. The Practicus should revive this Ritual
throughout in the Light of his personal researches in the Qabalah, and
thus make it his own peculiar property. The spelling here suggested
implies that he who utters the Word affirms his allegiance to the
symbols 93 and 61 that he is a warrior in the army of Will and of the
Sun. 93 is also the number of AIWAZ and 6 of The Beast.  
(3)The consonants of LOGOS, "Word", add (Hebrew values: sGL) to 93. And
EPH, "Words", (whence "Epic") has also that value: EIDE TA EPH might be
the phrase here intended: its number is 418. This would then assert the
accomplishment of the Great Work; this is the natural conclusion of the
Ritual. Cf. CCXX. III. 75.  
(4)These needs are modified during the process of Initiation both as to
quantity and quality. One should not become anxious about one's physical
or mental health on a priori grounds, but pay attention only to
indubitable symptoms of distress should such arise.  
(5)The Oracles of Zoroaster utter this:  
  

> "And when, by often invoking, all the phantasms are vanished, thou
> shalt see that Holy and Formless Fire, that Fire which darts and
> flashes through all the Depths of the Universe; hear thou the Voice of
> the Fire!  
>   
> "A similar Fire flashingly extending through the rushings of Air, or a
> Fire formless whence cometh the Image of a voice, or even a flashing
> Light abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying aloud. Also there
> is the vision of the fire-flashing Courser of Light, or also a Child,
> borne aloft on the shoulders of the Celestial Steed, fiery, or clothed
> with gold, or naked, or shooting with the bow shafts or light, and
> standing on the shoulders of the horse, then if thy meditation
> prolongeth itself, thou shalt unite all these symbols into the form of
> a Lion."

POINT III  
  
*Scholion on Sections G & Gg  
  
"The Seeds of Immortality!"*

The Adept who has mastered this Ritual, successfully realising the full
import of this controlled rapture, ought not to allow his mind to loosen
its grip on the astral imagery of the Star-spate, Will-Symbol, or
Soul-symbol, or even to forget its duty to the body and the sensible
surroundings. Nor should he omit to keep his Body of Light in close
touch with the phenomena of its own plane, so that its privy
consciousness may fulfil its proper functions of protecting his
scattered ideals from obsession.

But he should have acquired, by previous practice, the faculty of
detaching these elements of his consciousness from their articulate
centre, so that they become (temporarily) independent responsible units,
capable of receiving communications from headquarters at will, but
perfectly able (1) to take care of themselves without troubling their
chief, and (2) to report to him at the proper time. In a figure, they
must be like subordinate officers, expected to display self-reliance,
initiative, and integrity in the execution of the Orders of the Day.

The Adept should therefore be able to rely on these individual minds of
his to control their own conditions without interference from himself
for the time required, and to recall them in due course, receiving an
accurate report of their adventures.

This being so, the Adept will be free to concentrate his deepest self,
that part of him which unconsciously orders his true Will, upon the
realization of his Holy Guardian Angel. The absence of his bodily,
mental and astral consciousness is indeed cardinal to success, for it is
their usurpation of his attention which has made him deaf to his Soul,
and his preoccupation with their affairs that has prevented him from
perceiving that Soul.

The effect of the Ritual has been

> 1.  to keep them so busy with their own work that they cease to
>     distract him;  
> 2.  to separate them so completely that his soul is stripped of its
>     sheaths;  
> 3.  to arouse in him an enthusiasm so intense as to intoxicate and
>     anaesthetize him, that he may not feel and resent the agony of
>     this spiritual vivisection, just as bashful lovers get drunk on
>     the wedding night, in order to brazen out the intensity of shame
>     which so mysteriously coexists with their desire;  
> 4.  to concentrate the necessary spiritual forces from every element,
>     and fling them simultaneously into the aspiration towards the Holy
>     Guardian Angel; and  
> 5.  to attract the Angel by the vibration of the magical voice which
>     invokes Him.
>
> The method of the Ritual is thus manifold.
>
> There is firstly an analysis of the Adept, which enables him to
> calculate his course of action. He can decide what must be banished,
> what purified, what concentrated. He can then concentrate his will
> upon its one essential element, over-coming its resistance - which is
> automatic, like a physiological reflex - by destroying inhibitions
> through his ego-overwhelming enthusiasm. (1) The other half of the
> work needs no such complex effort; for his Angel is simple and
> unperplexed, ready at all times to respond to rightly ordered
> approach.
>
> It is impossible to overcome one's inhibitions by conscious effort;
> their existence justifies them. God is on their side, as on that of
> the victim in Browning's Instans Tyrannus. A man cannot compel himself
> to love, however much he may want to, on various rational grounds. But
> on the other hand, when the true impulse comes, it overwhelms all its
> critics; they are powerless either to make or break a genius; it can
> only testify to the fact that it has met its master.
>
> But the results of the Ritual are too various to permit of rigid
> description. One may say that, presuming the union to be perfect, the
> Adept need not retain any memory soever of what has occurred. He may
> be merely aware of a gap in his conscious life, and judge of its
> contents by observing that his nature has been subtly transfigured.
> Such an experience might indeed be the proof of perfection.
>
> If the Adept is to be any wise conscious of his Angel it must be that
> some part of his mind is prepared to realise the rapture, and to
> express it to itself in one way or another. This involves the
> perfection of that part, its freedom from prejudice and the
> limitations of rationality so-called. For instance: one could not
> receive the illumination as to the nature of life which the doctrine
> of evolution should shed, if one is passionately persuaded that
> humanity is essentially not animal, or convinced that causality is
> repugnant to reason. The Adept must be ready for the utter destruction
> of his point of view on any subject, and even that of his innate
> conception of the forms and laws of thought. (2) Thus he may find that
> his Angel consider his "business" or his "love" to be absurd trifles;
> also that human ideas of "time" are invalid, and human "laws" of logic
> applicable only to the relations between illusions.
>
> Now the Angel will make contact with the Adept at any point that is
> sensitive to His influence. Such a point will naturally be one that is
> salient in the Adept's character, and also one that is, in the proper
> sense of the word, pure. (3)
>
> Thus an artist, attuned to appreciate plastic beauty is likely to
> receive a visual impression of his Angel in a physical form which is
> sublimely quintessential of his ideal. A musician may be rapt away by
> majestic melodies such as he never hoped to hear. A philosopher may
> attain apprehension of tremendous truths, the solution of problems
> that had baffled him all his life.
>
> Conformably with this doctrine, we read of illuminations experienced
> by simple-minded men, such as a workman who "saw God" and likened Him
> to "a quantity of little pears". Again, we know that ecstasy,
> impinging upon unbalanced minds, inflames the idolised idea, and
> produces fanatical faith fierce even to frenzy, with intolerance and
> insanely disordered energy which is yet so powerful as to effect the
> destinies of empires.
>
> But the phenomena of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy
> Guardian Angel are a side issue; the essence of the Union is the
> intimacy. Their intimacy (or rather identity) is independent of all
> partial forms of expression; at its best it is therefore as
> inarticulate as Love.
>
> The intensity of the consummation will more probably compel a sob or a
> cry, some natural physical gesture of animal sympathy with the
> spiritual spasm. This is to be criticised as incomplete self-control.
> Silence is nobler.
>
> In any case the Adept must be in communion with his Angel, so that his
> Soul is suffused with sublimity, whether intelligible or not in terms
> of intellect. It is evident that the stress of such spiritual
> possession must tend to overwhelm the soul, especially at first. It
> actually suffers from the excess of its ecstasy, just as extreme love
> produces vertigo. The soul sinks and swoons. Such weakness is fatal
> alike to its enjoyment and its apprehension. "Be strong! then canst
> thou bear more rapture!" sayeth The Book of the Law. (4)
>
> The Adept must therefore play the man, arousing himself to harden his
> soul.
>
> To this end, I, the Beast, have made trial and proof of divers
> devices. Of these the most potent is to set the body to strive with
> the soul. Let the muscles take grip on themselves as if one were
> wrestling. Let the jaw and mouth, in particular, be tightened to the
> utmost. Breathe deeply, slowly, yet strongly. Keep mastery over the
> mind by muttering forcibly and audibly. But lest such muttering tend
> to disturb communion with the Angel, speak only His Name. Until the
> Adept have heard that Name, therefore, he may not abide in the perfect
> possession of his Beloved. His most important task is thus to open his
> ears to the voice of his Angel, that he may know him, how he is
> called. For hearken! this Name, understood rightly and fully,
> declareth the nature of the Angel in every point, wherefore also that
> Name is the formula of the perfection to which the Adept must aspire,
> and also of the power of Magick by virtue whereof he must work.
>
> He then that is as yet ignorant of that Name, let him repeat a word
> worthy of this particular Ritual. Such are Abrahadabra, the Word of
> the Aeon, which signifieth "The Great Work accomplished"; and Aumgn
> interpreted in Part III of Book 4 (5); and the name of THE BEAST, for
> that His number showeth forth this Union with the Angel, and His Work
> is no other than to make all men partakers of this Mystery of the
> Mysteries of Magick.
>
> So then saying this word or that, let the Adept wrestle with his Angel
> and withstand Him, that he may constrain Him to consent to continue in
> communion until the consciousness becomes capable of clear
> comprehension, and of accurate transmission (6) of the transcendent
> Truth of the Beloved to the heart that holds him.
>
> The firm repetition of one of these Words ought to enable the Adept to
> maintain the state of Union for several minutes, even at first.
>
> In any case he must rekindle his ardour, esteeming his success rather
> as an encouragement to more ardent aspiration than as a triumph. He
> should increase his efforts.
>
> Let him beware of the "lust of result", of expecting too much, of
> losing courage if his first success is followed by a series of
> failures.
>
> For success makes success seem so incredible that one is apt to create
> an inhibition fatal to subsequent attempts. One fears to fail; the
> fear intrudes upon the concentration and so fulfils its own prophecy.
> We know how too much pleasure in a love affair makes one afraid to
> disgrace oneself on the next few occasions; indeed, until familiarity
> has accustomed one to the idea that one's lover has never supposed one
> to be more than human. Confidence returns gradually. Inarticulate
> ecstasy is replaced by a more sober enjoyment of the elements of the
> fascination.
>
> Just so one's first dazzled delight in a new landscape turns, as one
> continues to gaze, to the appreciation of exquisite details of the
> view. At first they were blurred by the blinding rush of general
> beauty; they emerge one by one as the shock subsides, and passionate
> rapture yields to intelligent interest.
>
> In the same way the Adept almost always begins by torrential lyrics
> painting out mystical extravagances about "ineffable love",
> "unimaginable bliss", "inexpressible infinities of illimitable
> utterness". (7) He usually loses his sense of proportion, of humour,
> of reality, and of sound judgment. His ego is often inflated to the
> bursting point, till he would be abjectly ridiculous if he were not so
> pitifully dangerous to himself and others. He also tends to take his
> new-found "truths of illumination" for the entire body of truth, and
> insists that they must be as valid an vital for all men as they happen
> to be for himself.
>
> It is wise to keep silence about those things "unlawful to utter"
> which one may have heard "in the seventh heaven". This may not apply
> to the sixth.
>
> The Adept must keep himself in hand, however tempted to make a new
> heaven and a new earth in the next few days by trumpeting his
> triumphs. He must give time a chance to redress his balance, sore
> shaken by the impact of the Infinite.
>
> As he becomes adjusted to intercourse with his Angel, he will find his
> passionate ecstasy develop a quality of peace and intelligibility
> which adds power, while it informs and fortifies his mental and moral
> qualities instead of obscuring and upsetting them. He will by now have
> become able to converse with his Angel, impossible as it once seemed;
> for he now knows that the storm of sound which he supposed to be the
> Voice was only the clamour of his own confusions. The "infinity"
> nonsense was born of his own inability to think clearly beyond his
> limits, just as a Bushman, confronted by numbers above five, can only
> call them "many".
>
> The truth told by the Angel, immensely as it extends the horizon of
> the Adept, is perfectly definite and precise. It does not deal in
> ambiguities and abstractions. It possesses form, and confesses law, in
> exactly the same way and degree as any other body of truth. It is to
> the truth of the material and intellectual spheres of man very much
> what the Mathematics of Philosophy with its "infinite series" and
> "Cantorian continuity" is to schoolboy arithmetic. Each implies the
> other, though by that one may explore the essential nature of
> existence, and by this a pawnbroker's profits.
>
> This then is the true aim of the Adept in this whole operation, to
> assimilate himself to his Angel by continual conscious communion. For
> his Angel is an intelligible image of his own true Will, to do which
> is the whole of the law of his Being.
>
> Also the Angel appeareth in Tiphereth, which is the heart of the
> Ruach, and thus the Centre of Gravity of the Mind. It is also directly
> inspired from Kether, the ultimate Self, through the Path of the High
> Priestess, or initiated intuition. Hence the Angel is in truth the
> Logos or articulate expression of the whole Being of the Adept, so
> that as he increases in the perfect understanding of His name, he
> approaches the solution of the ultimate problem, Who he himself truly
> is.
>
> Unto this final statement the Adept may trust his Angel to lead him;
> for the Tiphereth-consciousness alone is connected by paths with the
> various parts of his mind. (8) None therefore save He hath the
