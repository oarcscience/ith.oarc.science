#### [Top](#Index) The Magus with Wand. On the Altar are incense, Fire, Bread, Wine, the Chain, the Scourge, the Dagger & the Oil. In his left hand the Bell he taketh.

> Hail! Asi! hail, Hoor-Apep! Let  
> The Silence speech beget! Two strokes on Bell.  
> Banishing Spiral Dance.  
> The Words against the Sons of Night  
> Tahuti speaketh in the Light.  
> Knowledge & Power, twin warriors, shake  
> The Invisible; they roll asunder  
> The Darkness; matter shines, a snake.  
> Sebek is smitten by the thunderÄ  
> The Light breaks forth from Under.

He goes to the West, in the centre of the base of the Triangle of THOTH
(Maim), ASI (Aleph), & HOOR (Shin).

> O Thou, the Apex of the Plane,  
> With Ibis head & Phoenix Wand  
> And Wings of Night! Whose serpents strain  
> Thou in the Light & in the Night!

He lays the Wand, etc., on the Altar, uses the Scourge on his buttocks,
cuts a cross with the Daggar upon his breast & tightens the Chain of the
Bell about his forehead, saying:

> The Lustral Water! Smite thy flood  
> Through meÄLymph, marrow & blood! Annointing the Wounds, say  
> The Fire Informing! Let the Oil  
> Balance, assain, assoil! The Invoking Spiral Dance.  
> So Life takes Fire from Death, & runs  
> Whirling amid the Suns.  
> Hail, Asi! Pace the Path, bind on  
> The girdle of the Starry One!  

Sign of the Enterer: Homage to Thee, Lord of the Word! Sign of Silence:
Lord of Silence, Homage to Thee! Repeat both Signs: Lord we adore Thee,
still & stirred Beyond Infinity. The Secret Word: MTzThBTzMÄ271 (Blue,
Orange, Yellow-Green, Yellow, Orange, Blue)

> For from the Silence of the Wand  
> Unto the Speaking of the Sword,  
> And back again to the Beyond,  
> This is the toil & the Reward.  
> This is the Path of HVAÄHo!  
> This is the Path of IAO. Bell.  
> Hail Asi! Hail, thou Wanded Wheel!  
> Alpha & Delta kissed & came  
> For five that feed the Flame. Bell.  
> Hail, Hoor-Apep! thou Sword of Steel!  
> Alpha & Delta & Epsilon  
> Met in the Shadow of the Pylon  
> And in Iota did proclaim  
> That tenfold core & crown of flame.  
> Hail, Hoor-Apep! Unspoken Name!  
> Thus is the Great Pyramid duly builded.

Gates of Hell.)
