## A new translation of the Book of Changes by The Master Therion

  

## INTRODUCTION

The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. Its structure is
cognate with that of the Qabalah; the actual apparatus is simple, and
five minutes is sufficient to obtain a fairly detailed answer to any but
the most obscure questions.  
To Mega Therion

### THE TAO

1\. TAO concentrateth itself upon Kether as a point.

2\. TAO directeth itself within Chokmah and becometh the Male Force. He
is called YANG, and is symbolized by a Solid Line.

3\. TAO expandeth in Binah and becometh the Female Force. She is called
YIN, and is symbolized by a Broken Line.

4\. These three: TAO, YANG and YIN, bring forth heaven and earth, and
all contained therein.

### THE APPARATUS

0\. TAO is the source of the Yi King, as of all.

1\. Thou shalt obtain 6 Chinese coins. Five shall be of one metal and
the sixth of another. One side ye shall call Yang, and the other Yin
(Heads and Tails).

2\. These coins should be kept in a wrapped black cloth, and no other
should lay his hand upon them. For they swell with thine aura when used
with sincerity and repetition.

3\. Hast no coins? Six sticks will serve. Paint one side solid and the
other broken. One of the six is especial; It should be made unique by
painting one end on both sides. Care for thine sticks as though they
were coins.

### THE METHOD

4\. When a situation ariseth in thy mind, and you wouldst seek an
oracle, do thus: Go and take out thine coins or sticks.

5\. Face thou East; and make clear thy mind, so that no thoughts shall
intrude.

6\. Call upon what god ye will; filling thyself with pure light, and
raising thine mind to a fixed image of the situation into which you
inquire.

7\. Then, gently toss thy sticks or coins toward the East; they wilst
fall into a certain pattern which thou wilt arrange into an Hexagram -
the unit of Divination of this book: Yi King.

### THE HEXAGRAM

8\. An Hexagram is made up of six lines; each line being Yang or Yin.
The especial stick or coin is called "The Moving Line."

9\. Each line of the Hexagram is numbered: The line nearest thyself is
number One; whilst the farthest away is number Six.

### AN EXAMPLE

10\. Thou hast concentrated upon thy situation, and thine sticks have
fallen thus:

Line 6 - YANG (a solid line)  
Line 5 - YANG (a solid line)  
Line 4 - Yang (a solid line)

Line 3 - YANG (a solid line)  
Line 2 - YIN (a broken line)  
Line 1 - YIN (a broken line)

( - The moving line is in line 2)

11\. The Hexagram will look like this:

    ----------
    ----------
    ----------
    ----------
    ----  ----
    ----  ----

12\. Take notice that the Hexagram is divided into two Trigrams: An
upper Trigram and a lower Trigram.

### INTERPRETATION

13\. Taking thine key, which is in this book: thou wilst find the upper
Trigram along the top of the squares. Next, find the lower Trigram at
the left of the chart.

14\. Follow thee the Trigrams into the center of the Key - Behold the
number 33.

15\. Then, thou shalt read the Thirty-third Hexagram in this Book: Yi
King.

16\. The first two lines refer to the Hexagram as a whole, shewing thee
the direction of the matter.

17\. Next, appeareth a six-line poem. The first line of this poem
pertaineth to the line number One in the Hexagram. The last line of the
poem is for number Six (the one farthest from thy-self).

18\. The Moving Line (in this case number Two) is the specific line
which pertains to thy situation: Thine answer from the TAO.

19\. If thou dost not understand, and are bewildered by doubts and
questions concerning the Forces of this Divination: Thou mayest read in
"Magick" where the Master Therion hath made discourse upon the subject
by his understanding of the TAO.
