## <span id="1"></span>I

1.  It is absolutely necessary that all experiments should be recorded
    in detail during, or immediately after, their performance.
2.  It is highly important to note the physical and mental condition of
    the experimenter or experimenters.
3.  The time and place of all experiments must be noted; also the state
    of the weather, and generally all conditions which might conceivably
    have any result upon the experiment either as adjuvants to or causes
    of the result, or as inhibiting it, or as sources of error.
4.  The A.·. A.·. will not take official notice of any experiments which
    are not thus properly recorded.
5.  It is not necessary at this stage for us to declare fully the
    ultimate end of our researches; nor indeed would it be understood by
    those who have not become proficient in these elementary courses.
6.  The experimenter is encouraged to use his own intelligence, and not
    to rely upon any other person or persons, however distinguished,
    even among ourselves.
7.  The written record should be intelligently *(WEH NOTE: EQUINOX I, 1
    has "intelligibly".)* prepared so that others may benefit from its
    study.
8.  The Book John St. John published in the first number of the
    "Equinox" is an example of this kind of record by a very advanced
    student. It is not as simply written as we could wish, but will show
    the method.
9.  The more scientific the record is, the better. Yet the emotions
    should be noted, as being some of the conditions.  
    Let then the record be written with sincerity and care; thus with
    practice it will be found more and more to approximate to the ideal.

## <span id="2"></span>II Physical clairvoyance

1.  Take a pack of (78) Tarot playing cards. Shuffle; cut. Draw one
    card. Without looking at it, try to name it. Write down the card you
    name, and the actual card. Repeat, and tabulate results.
2.  This experiment is probably easier with an old genuine pack of Tarot
    cards, preferably a pack used for divination by some one who really
    understood the matter.
3.  Remember that one should expect to name the right card once in 78
    times. Also be careful to exclude all possibilities of obtaining the
    knowledge through the ordinary senses of sight and touch, or even
    smell.  
    There was once a man whose fingertips were so sensitive that he
    could feel the shape and position of the pips and so judge the card
    correctly.
4.  It is better to try first the easier form of the experiment, by
    guessing only the suit.
5.  Remember that in 78 experiments you should obtain 22 trumps and 14
    of each other suit; so that without any clairvoyance at all, you can
    guess right twice in 7 times (roughly) by calling trumps each time.
6.  Note that some cards are harmonious.  
    Thus it would not be a bad error to call the five of Swords ("The
    Lord of Defeat") instead of the ten of Swords ("The Lord of Ruin").
    But to call the Lord of Love (2 Cups) for the Lord of Strife (5
    Wands) would show that you were getting nothing right.  
    Similarly a card ruled by Mars would be harmonious with a 5, a card
    of Gemini with "The Lovers".
7.  These harmonies must be thoroughly learnt, according to the numerous
    tables given in 777.
8.  As you progress you will find that you are able to distinguish the
    suit correctly three times in four and that very few indeed
    inharmonious errors occur, while in 78 experiments you are able to
    name the card aright as many as 15 or 20 times.
9.  When you have reached this stage, you may be admitted for
    examination; and in the event of your passing you will be given more
    complex and difficult exercises.

## <span id="3"></span>III Asana - Posture

1.  You must learn to sit perfectly still with every muscle tense for
    long periods.
2.  You must wear no garments that interfere with the posture in any of
    these experiments.
3.  The first position: (The God). Sit in a chair; head up, back
    straight, knees together, hands on knees, eyes closed.
4.  The second position: (The Dragon). Kneel; buttocks resting on the
    heels, toes turned back, back and head straight, hands on thighs.
5.  The third position: (The Ibis). Stand, hold left ankle with right
    hand, *(WEH NOTE: The EQUINOX version adds: "(and alternately
    practise right ankle in left hand, &c.)".)* free forefinger on lips.
6.  The fourth position: (The Thunderbolt). Sit; left heel pressing up
    anus, right foot poised on its toes, the heel covering the phallus;
    arms stretched out over the knees; head and back straight.
7.  Various things will happen to you while you are practising these
    positions; they must be carefully analysed and described.
8.  Note down the duration of practice; the severity of the pain (if
    any) which accompanies it, the degree of rigidity attained, and any
    other pertinent matters.
9.  When you have progressed up to the point that a saucer filled to the
    brim with water and poised upon the head does not spill one drop
    during a whole hour, and when you can no longer perceive the
    slightest tremor in any muscle; when, in short, you are perfectly
    steady and easy, you will be admitted for examination; and, should
    you pass, you will be instructed in more complex and difficult
    practices.

## <span id="4"></span>IV Pranayama - Regularisation of the Breathing

1.  At rest in one of your positions, close the right nostril with the
    thumb of the right hand and breathe out slowly and completely
    through the left nostril, while your watch marks 20 seconds. Breathe
    in through the same nostril for 10 seconds. Changing hands, repeat
    with the other nostril. Let this be continuous for one hour.
2.  When this is quite easy to you, increase the periods to 30 and 15
    seconds.
3.  When this is quite easy to you, but not before, breathe out for 15
    seconds, in for 15 seconds, and hold the breath for 15 seconds.
4.  When you can do this with perfect ease and comfort for a whole hour,
    practice breathing out for 40 and in for 20 seconds.
5.  This being attained, practice breathing out for 20, in for 10,
    holding the breath for 30 seconds.
6.  When this has become perfectly easy to you, you may be admitted for
    examination, and should you pass, you will be instructed in more
    complex and difficult practices.
7.  You will find that the presence of food in the stomach, even in
    small quantities, makes the practices very difficult.
8.  Be very careful never to overstrain your powers; especially never
    get so short of breath that you are compelled to breathe out jerkily
    or rapidly.
9.  Strive after depth, fullness, and regularity of breathing.
10. Various remarkable phenomena will very probably occur during these
    practices. They must be carefully analysed and recorded.

## <span id="5"></span>V Dharana - Control of Thought

1.  Constrain the mind to concentrate itself upon a single simple object
    imagined.  
    The five tatwas are useful for this purpose; they are: a black oval;
    a blue disk; a silver crescent; a yellow square; a red triangle.
2.  Proceed to combinations of simple objects; e.g. a black oval within
    a yellow square, and so on.
3.  Proceed to simple moving objects, such as a pendulum swinging, a
    wheel revolving, etc. Avoid living objects.
4.  Proceed to combinations of moving objects, e.g. a piston rising and
    falling while a pendulum is swinging. The relation between the two
    movements should be varied in different experiments.  
    Or even a system of flywheels, eccentrics, and governor.
5.  During these practices the mind must be absolutely confined to the
    object determined upon; no other thought must be allowed to intrude
    upon the consciousness. The moving systems must be regular and
    harmonious.
6.  Note carefully the duration of the experiments, the number and
    nature of the intruding thoughts, the tendency of the object itself
    to depart from the course laid out for it, and any other phenomena
    which may present themselves. Avoid overstrain; this is very
    important.
7.  Proceed to imagine living objects; as a man, preferably some man
    known to, and respected by, yourself.
8.  In the intervals of these experiments you may try to imagine the
    objects of the other senses, and to concentrate upon them.  
    For example, try to imagine the taste of chocolate, the smell of
    roses, the feeling of velvet, the sound of a waterfall or the
    ticking of a watch.
9.  Endeavour finally to shut out all objects of any of the senses, and
    prevent all thoughts arising in your mind. When you feel you have
    attained some success in these practices, apply for examination, and
    should you pass, more complex and difficult practices will be
    prescribed for you.

## <span id="6"></span>VI Physical limitations

1.  It is desirable that you should discover for yourself your physical
    limitations.
2.  To this end ascertain for how many hours you can subsist without
    food or drink before your working capacity is seriously interfered
    with.
3.  Ascertain how much alcohol you can take, and what forms of
    drunkenness assail you.
4.  Ascertain how far you can walk without once stopping; likewise with
    dancing, swimming, running, etc.
5.  Ascertain for how many hours you can do without sleep.
6.  Test your endurance with various gymnastic exercises, club swinging,
    and so on.
7.  Ascertain for how long you can keep silence.
8.  Investigate any other capacities and aptitudes which may occur to
    you.
9.  Let all these things be carefully and conscientiously recorded; for
    according to your powers will it be demanded of you.

## <span id="7"></span>VII A Course of Reading

1.  The object of most of the foregoing practices will not at first be
    clear to you; but at least (who will deny it?) they have trained you
    in determination, accuracy, introspection, and many other qualities
    which are valuable to all men in their ordinary avocations, so that
    in no case will your time have been wasted.
2.  That you may gain some insight into the nature of the Great Work
    which lies beyond these elementary trifles, however, we should
    mention that an intelligent person may gather more than a hint of
    its nature from the following books, which are to be taken as
    serious and learned contributions to the study of Nature, though not
    necessarily to be implicitly relied upon.  
    *The Yi King* (S.B.E. Series, Oxford University Press.)  
    *The Tao Teh King* (S.B.E. Series.)  
    *Tannhauser*, by A. Crowley.  
    *The Upanishads*.  
    *The Bhagavad-Gita*.  
    *The Voice of the Silence.*  
    *Raja Yoga*, by Swami Vivekananda.  
    *The Shiva Sanhita*.  
    *The Aphorisms of Patanjali*.  
    *The Sword of Song*.  
    *The Book of the Dead*.  
    *Rituel et Dogme de la Haute Magie*.  
    *The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage*.  
    *The Goetia*.  
    *The Hathayoga Pradipika*.  
    *The Spiritual Guide of Molinos*.  
    Erdmann's *History of Philosophy*.  
    *The Star in the West* (Captain Fuller).  
    *The Dhammapada* (S.B.E. Series, Oxford University Press).  
    *The Questions of King Milinda* (S.B.E. Series).  
    *777 vel Prolegomena, etc.*.  
    *Varieties of Religious Experience* (James).  
    *Kabbala Denudata*.  
    *Konx Om Pax*.
3.  Careful study of these books will enable the pupil to speak in the
    language of his master, and facilitate communications with him.
4.  The pupil should endeavour to discover the fundamental harmony of
    these very varied works; for this purpose he will find it best to
    study the most extreme divergencies side by side.
5.  He may at any time that he wishes apply for examination in this
    course of reading.
6.  During the whole of this elementary study and practice he will do
    wisely to seek out and attach himself to, a master, one competent to
    correct him and advise him. Nor should he be discouraged by the
    difficulty of finding such a person.
7.  Let him further remember that he must in no wise rely upon, or
    believe in, that master. He must rely entirely upon himself, and
    credit nothing whatever but that which lies within his own knowledge
    and experience.
8.  As in the beginning, so at the end, we here insist upon the vital
    importance of the written record as the only possible check upon
    error derived from the various qualities of the experimenter.
9.  Thus let the work be accomplished duly; yea, let it be accomplished
    duly.  
    (If any really important or remarkable results should occur, or if
    any great difficulty presents itself, the A.·. A.·. should be at
    once informed of the circumstances.)
