# The Cry of the 30th Aethyr Which is Called TEX[**1**](#1.md)

I AM in a vast crystal cube in the form of the Great God Harpocrates.
This cube is surrounded by a sphere[**2**](#2.md). About me are four
archangels in black robes, their wings and armour lined out in white.

In the North[**3**](#3.md) is a book on whose back and front are A.M.B.Z.
[**4**](#4) in Enochian characters. ({ENO:z}{ENO:b}{ENO:m}{ENO:a}.md)

Within it is written:

I AM, the surrounding of the four.

Lift up your heads, O Houses of Eternity: for my Father goeth forth to
judge the World. One Light, let it become a thousand, and one sword ten
thousand, that no man hide him from my Father's eye in the Day of
Judgment of my God. Let the Gods hide themselves: let the Angels be
troubled and flee away: for the Eye of My Father is open, and the Book
of the Aeons is fallen.

Arise! Arise! Arise! Let the Light of the Sight of Time be extinguished:
let the Darkness cover all things: for my Father goeth forth to seek a
spouse to replace her who is fallen and defiled.

Seal the book with the seals of the Stars Concealed: for the Rivers have
rushed together and the Name {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}is
broken in a thousand pieces (against the Cubic Stone).

Tremble ye, O Pillars of the Universe[**5**](#5.md), for Eternity is in
travail of a Terrible Child; she shall bring forth an universe of
Darkness, whence shall leap forth a spark that shall put his father to
flight.

The Obelisks are broken; the stars have rushed together: the Light hath
plunged into the Abyss: the Heavens are mixed with Hell.

My Father shall not hear their Noise: His ears are closed: His eyes are
covered with the clouds of Night.

The End! the End! the End: For the Eye of Shiva He hath opened: the
Universe is naked before Him: for the Aeon of Saturn leaneth toward the
Bosom of Death[**6**](#6.md).

\[Figure: This is an isosceles triangle with height about 7 times the
base. It extends with base on a true vertical from the left. A line
extends vertically upward from the apex, equal to the length of the
base. A trefoliate of three isosceles triangles of base slightly smaller
than the first triangle and sides equal to the first triangle is created
at the upper tip of the line. The tree component triangles of the
terfolate meet the upper tip of the line with their apices --- one
vertically and two to right and left.\][**7**](#7.md)

The Angel of the East[**8**](#8.md) hath a book of red written in letters
of Blue A.B.F.M.A.[**9**](#9.md) in Enochian ({ENO:a} {ENO:m} {ENO:f}
{ENO:b} {ENO:a}). The Book grows before my eyes and filleth the Whole
Heaven.

Within: "It is Written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God."

I see above the Book a multitude of white-robed Ones from whom droppeth
a great rain of Blood[**10**](#10.md); but above them is a Golden Sun,
having an eye, whence a great Light[**11**](#11.md).

I turned me to the South[**12**](#12.md): and read therein:

Seal up the Book! Speak not that which thou seest and reveal it unto
none: for the ear is not framed that shall hear it: nor the tongue that
can speak it!

O Lord God, blessed, blessed, blessed be Thou for ever!

Thy Shadow is as great Light.

Thy Name is as the Breath of Love across all Worlds.

\[Figure: This is a swastika or fylfot cross. It is widdershins, with
each bend going to the right when viewed down one arm from the center.
All elements are either vertical or horizontal, none
diagonal.\][**13**](#13.md)

(A vast Svastika is shewn unto me behind the Angel with the Book.)

Rend your garments, O ye clouds! Uncover yourselves! for the Love of My
Son!

Who are they that trouble thee?

Who are they that slew thee?

O Light! Come thou, who art joined with me to bruise the Dragon's
head[**14**](#14.md). We, who are wedded, and the Earth perceiveth it not!

O that Our Bed were seen of Men, that they might rejoice in My
Fertility: that My Sister might partake of My Great Light.

O Light of God, when wilt thou find the heart of man --- write not! I
would not that men know the Sorrow of my Heart, Amen!

I turned me to the West[**15**](#15.md), and the Archangel bore a flaming
Book, on which was written AN[**16**](#16) in Enochian ({ENO:n}{ENO:a}.md).
Within was drawn a fiery scorpion, yet cold withal[**17**](#17.md).

Until the Book of the East be opened!

Until the hour sound!

Until the Voice vibrate!

Until it pierce my Depth;

Look not on High!

Look not Beneath!

For thou wilt find a life which is as Death: or a Death which should be
infinite.

For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is
lone and far[**18**](#18.md).

For she is "lone and far", i.e., beyond the Abyss.

O Lord God, let Thy Spirit hither unto me!

For I am lost in the night of infinite pain: no hope: no God: no
resurrection: no end: I fall: I fear.

O Saviour of the World, bruise Thou my Head with Thy foot to save the
world, that once again I touch Him whom I slew, that in my death I feel
the radiance and the heat of the moving of Thy Robes!

Let us alone! What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth?

Go! Go!

If I keep silence --- Or if I speak each word is anguish without hope.

And I heard the Aethyr cry aloud "Return! Return! Return! For the work
is ended; and the Book is shut; and let the glory be to God the Blessed
for ever in the Aeons, Amen." Thus far is the voice of TEX and no more.
