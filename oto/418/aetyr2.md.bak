**The Cry of the 2nd Aethyr,  
Which is Called ARN**[**1**](#1.md)

In the first place, there is again the woman riding on the bull, which
is the reflection of BABALON, that rideth on The Beast. And also there
is an Assyrian legend of a woman with a fish, and also there is a legend
of Eve and the Serpent, for Cain was the the child of Eve and the
Serpent, and not of Eve and Adam; and therefore when he had slain his
brother, who was the first murderer, having sacrificed living things to
his demon, had Cain the mark upon his brow, which is the mark of the
Beast spoken of in the Apocalypse, and is the sign of
initiation[**2**](#2.md).

The shedding of blood is necessary, for God did not hear the children of
Eve until blood was shed[**3**](#3.md). And that is external religion; but
Cain spake not with God, nor had the mark of initiation upon his brow,
so that he was shunned by all men, until he had shed blood. And this
blood was the blood of his brother. This is a mystery of the sixth key
of the Taro, which ought not to be called The Lovers, but The
Brothers[**4**](#4.md).

In the middle of the card stands Cain; in his right hand is the Hammer
of Thor with which he hath slain his brother, and it is all wet with his
blood. And his left hand he holdeth open as a sign of innocence. And on
his right hand is his mother Eve, around whom the serpent is entwined
with his hood spread behind her head; and on his left hand is a figure
somewhat like the Hindoo Kali, but much more seductive. Yet I know it to
be Lilith. And above him is the Great Sigil of the Arrow, downward, but
it is struck through the heart of the child. This Child is also
Abel[**5**](#5.md). And the meaning of this part of the card is obscure,
but that is the correct drawing of the Taro card; and that is the
correct magical fable from which the Hebrew scribes, who were not
complete Initiates, stole their legend of the Fall and the subsequent
events. They joined different fables together to try and make a
connected story, and they sophisticted them to suit their sociall and
political conditions.

All this while no image hath come unto the Stone, and no voice hath been
heard.

I cannot get any idea of the source of what I have been saying. All I
can say is, that there is a sort of dew, like mist, upon the Stone, and
yet it has become hot to the touch[**6**](#6.md).

All I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so
totally disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and
ruthlessly planed down to make them into a connected account; and that
recension was re-written and edited in the interests of Christianity,
because people were complaining that Christianity could show no true
spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best minds: nothing but
miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, which
only suited pedants.

So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and
imitated the style of John.[**7**](#7.md) And this explains why the end of
the world does not happen every few years, as advertised[**8**](#8.md).

There is nothing whatever in the Stone but a White Rose. And a voice
comes: there shall be no more red roses, for she hath crushed all the
blood of all things into her cup.

It seemed at one time as if the rose was in the breast of a beautiful
woman, high-bosomed, tall, stately, yet who danced like a snake. But
there was no subsistence in this vision[**9**](#9.md).

And now I see the white Rose, as if it were in the beak of a swan, in
the picture by Michael Angelo in Venice. And that legend too is the
legend of BABALON.

But all this is before the veil of the Aethyr. Now will I go and make
certain preparations[**10**](#10.md), and I will return and repeat the call
of the Aethyr yet again.

Biskra.  
December 18, 1909. 9:20 - 10:5 a.m.

It is not a question of being unable to get into the Aethyr, and trying
to struggle through; but one is not anywhere near it[**11**](#11.md).

A voice comes: When thy dust shall strew the earth whereon She walketh,
then mayest thou bear the impress of Her foot. And thou thinkest to
behold Her face!

The Stone is become of the most brilliant whiteness, and yet, in that
whiteness, all the other colours are implicit[**12**](#12.md). The colour
of anything is but its dullness, its obstructiveness. So is it with
these visions. All that they *are* is falsity. Every idea merely marks
where the mind of the Seer was too stupid to receive the light, and
therefore reflected it. Therefore, as the pure light is colourless, so
is the pure soul black[**13**](#13.md).

And this is the Mystery of the incest of CHAOS with his
daughter[**14**](#14.md).

There is nothing whatever visible.

But I asked of the Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been
duly performed. And he says: Yes, the Aethyr is present. It is thou that
canst not perceive it, even as I cannot perceive it, because it is so
entirely beyond thy conception that there is nothing in thy mind on to
which it can cast a symbol, even as the emptiness of space is not heated
by the fire of the sun. And so pure is the light that it preventeth the
formation of images, and therefore have men called it darkness. For with
any lesser light, the mind responds, and makes for itself divers
palaces[**15**](#15.md). It is that which is written: "In my Father's house
there are many mansions"; and if the house be destroyed, how much more
the mansions that are therein! For this is the victory of BABALON over
the Magician that ensorcelled[**16**](#16.md) her. For as the Mother she is
3 by 52, and as the harlot she is 6 by 26; but she is also 12 by 13, and
that is the pure unity[**17**](#17.md). Moreover she is 4 by 39, that is,
victory over the power of the 4, and in 2 by 78 hath she destroyed the
great Sorcerer[**18**](#18.md). Thus is she the synthesis of 1 and 2 and 3
and 4, which being added are 10, therefore could she set her daughter
upon her own throne, and defile her own bed with her
virginity[**19**](#19.md).

And I ask the Angel if there is any way by which I can make myself
worthy to behold the Mysteries of this Aethyr.

And he saith: It is not in my knowledge. Yet do thou make once more in
silence the Call of the Aethyr, and wait patiently upon the favour of
the Angel, for He is a mighty Angel, and never yet have I heard the
whisper of his wing.

This is the translation of the Call of the Aethyr[**20**](#20.md).

O ye heavens which dwell in the first Aire, and are mighty in the parts
of the earth, and execute therein the judgment of the highest, to you it
is said: Behold the face of your God, the beginning of comfort, whose
eyes are the brightness of the heavens which provided you for the
government of the earth, and her unspeakable variety, furnishing you
with a power of understanding, that ye might dispose all things
according to the foresight of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, and
rose up in the beginning, saying, The earth, let her be governed by her
parts (this is the prostitution of BABALON to Pan), and let there be
division in her (the formation of the Many from the One), that her glory
may be always ecstasy and the irritation of orgasm. Her course let it
round with the heavens (that is, let her way be always harmonious with
heaven), and as an handmaid let her serve them (that is, the Virgin of
Eternity climbing into the bed of CHAOS). One season let it confound
another (that is, let there be unwearying variety of
predicates)[**21**](#21.md)}, and let there be no creature upon or within
her the same (that is, let there be an unwearying variety of
subjects)[**22**](#22.md). All her members let them differ in their
qualities, and let there be no one creature[**23**](#23.md) equal with
another (for if there were any duplication or omission, there would be
no perfection in the whole). The reasonable creatures of the earth and
men, let them vex and weed out one another (this is, the destruction of
reason by internecine conflicts in the course of redemption). And their
dwelling places, let them forget their names. (This is, the arising of
Nemo.) The work of man and his pomp, let them be defaced. (That is, in
the Great Work man must lose his personality.) His building, let it be a
cave for the Beast of the Field. ("His building" means the Vault of the
Adepts, and the "Cave" is the Cave of the Mountain of Abiegnus, and the
"Beast" is he upon whom BABALON rideth, and the "Field" is the supernal
Eden.) Confound her understanding with darkness. (This sentence is
explained by what has been said concerning Binah.) For why, it rejoiceth
me concerning the Virgin and the Man[**24**](#24.md). (Kelly did not
understand this Call at all, and he would not believe this sentence was
written so, for it seemed to contradict the rest of the Call, so he
altered it.) One while let her be known and another while a stranger,
(that is, the Mystery of the Holy One being at the same time identical
with everything and apart from it), because she is the bed of an harlot,
and the dwelling of him that is fallen. (That is that Mystery which was
revealed in the last Aethyr; the universe being, as it were, a garden
wherein the Holy Ones may take their pleasure.) O ye heavens, arise; the
lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you. (This is a command for
the whole of things to join in universal rapture.) Govern those that
govern; cast down such as fall; bring forth those that increase; and
destroy the rotten. (This means that everything shall take its own
pleasure in its own way.[**25**](#25).md) No place let it remain in one
number. ("No place" is the infinite Ain . . . "Let remain in one
number"; that is, let it be concentrated in Kether.) Add and diminish
until the stars be numbered. (It is a mystery of the Logos being
formulated by the Qabalah, because the stars, are all letters of the
Holy Alphabet, as it was said in a former Aethyr.) Arise! Move! and
Appear! before the covenant of his mouth which he hath shewn unto us in
his Justice. ("The Covenant" is the letter Aleph; "His mouth", pe'; "His
Justice", lamed; and these add up again to Aleph, so that it is in the
letter Aleph, which is zero, thus symbolizing the circles of the
Aethyrs, that he calleth them forth. But men thought that Aleph was the
initial ARR, cursing, when it was really the initial of AChD, unity, and
AHBH, love. So that it was the most horrible and wicked blasphemy of the
blackest of all the black brothers to begin Barashith with a beth, with
the letter of the Magician. Yet, by this simple device, hath he created
the whole illusion of sorrow.[**26**](#26).md) Open the mysteries of your
creation, and make us partakers of the undefiled knowledge. (The word
here is "IADNAMAD" is not the ordinary word for knowledge. It is a word
of eight letters, which is the secret name of God, summarized in the
letter cheth; for which see the Aethyr which correspondeth to that
letter, the twelfth Aethyr.[**27**](#27).md)

Now from time to time I have looked into the Stone, but never is there
any image therein, or any hint thereof; but now there are three arrows,
arranged thus:

\[Figure here: Three arrows intersecting in the common centers of the
three shafts. Two are diagonal, forming an "X" with points to top and
fledging to bottom. The third is vertical, bisecting the "X" with point
below and fledging to the top.\]

This is the letter Aleph in the Alphabet of Arrows.

(I want to say that while I was doing the translation of the Call of the
Aethyrs, the soles of my feet were burning, as if I were on red hot
steel.[**28**](#28).md)

And now the fire was spread all over me, and parches me, and tortures
me. And my sweat is bitter like poison. And all my blood is acrid in my
veins, like gleet. I seem to be all festering, rotting; and the worms
eating me while I am yet alive.

A voice, neither in myself nor out of myself, is saying: Remember
Prometheus; remember Ixion[**29**](#29.md).

I am tearing[**30**](#30.md) at nothing. I will not heed. For even this
dust[**31**](#31.md) must be consumed with fire.

And now, although there is no image, at last there is a sense of
obstacle, as if one were at length drawing near to the frontier of the
Aethyr.

But I am dying.

I can neither strive nor wait. There is agony in my ears, and in my
throat, and mine eyes have been so long blind that I cannot remember
that there ever was such a thing as sight[**32**](#32.md).

And it cometh to me that I should go away, and await the coming of the
veil of the Aethyr; not here. I think I will go to the Hot
Springs[**33**](#33.md).

So I put away the Stone upon my breast.

Biskra  
10:15-11:52 a.m.

Flashes of lightning are playing in the Stone, at the top; and at the
bottom of the Stone there is a black pyramid[**34**](#34.md), and at the
top thereof is a vesica piscis. The vesica piscis[**35**](#35.md) is of
colourless brilliance.

The two curves of Pisces are thus:

\[Figure here: The Pisces sign without the cross-line. In Essence ") (",
but larger with thick curves.\]

They are the same curves as the curves of vesica piscis, but turned
round[**36**](#36.md)}.

And a voice comes: How can that which is buried in the
pyramids[**37**](#37.md) behold that which descendeth unto its
apex[**38**](#38.md)?

Again it comes to me, without voice: Therefore is motherhood the symbol
of the Masters. For first they must give up their virginity to be
destroyed, and the seed must lie hidden in them until the nine moons wax
and wane, and they must surround it with the Universal Fluid. And they
must feed it with the blood for fire. Then is the child a living thing.
And afterwards is much suffering and much joy, and after that are they
torn asunder, and this is all their thank, that they give it to
suck[**39**](#39.md).

All this while the vision in the Shew-Stone stays as it was, save that
the lightning grows more vehement and clear; and behind the vesica
piscis is a black cross[**40**](#40.md) extending to the top and to the
edges of the Stone. And now blackness spreads, and swallows up the
images.

Now there is naught but a vast black triangle having the apex
downwards[**41**](#41.md), and in the centre of the black triangle is the
face of Typhon, the Lord of the Tempest, and he crieth aloud: Despair!
Despair! For thou mayest deceive the Virgin, and thou mayest cojole the
Mother; but what wilt thou say unto the ancient Whore that is throned in
Eternity? For if she will not, there is neither force nor cunning, nor
any wit, that may prevail upon her.

Thou canst not woo her with love[**42**](#42.md), for she *is* love. And
she hath all, and hath no need of thee.

And thou canst not woo her with gold[**43**](#43.md), for all the Kings and
captains of the earth, and all the gods of heaven, have showered their
gold upon her. Thus hath she all, and hath no need of thee.

And thou canst not woo her with knowledge, for knowledge is the thing
that she hath spurned[**44**](#44.md). She hath it all, and hath no need of
thee.

And thou canst not woo her with wit[**45**](#45.md), for her Lord is Wit.

She hath it all, and hath no need of thee. Despair! Despair!

Nor canst thou cling to her knees and ask for pity; nor canst thou cling
to her heart and ask for love; nor canst thou put thine arms about her
neck, and ask for understanding; for thou had all these[**46**](#46.md),
and they avail thee not. Despair! Despair!

Then I took the Flaming Sword[**47**](#47.md), and I let it loose against
Typhon, so that his head was cloven asunder, and the black triangle
dissolved in lightnings[**48**](#48.md).

But as he parted his voice broke out again: Nor canst thou win her with
the Sword, for her eyes are fixed upon the eyes of Him in whose hand is
the hilt of the Sword[**49**](#49.md). Despair! Despair!

And the echo of that cry was his word, which is identical, although it
be diverse: Nor canst thou win her by the Serpent[**50**](#50.md), for it
was the Serpent that seduced her first. Despair! Despair!

(Yet he cried thus as he fled:)

I am Leviathan, the great Lost Serpent of the Sea. I writhe eternally in
torment, and I lash the ocean with my tail into a whirlpool of foam that
is vemonous and bitter, and I have no purpose. I go no whither. I can
neither live nor die. I can but rave and rave in my death agony. I am
the Crocodile[**51**](#51.md) that eateth up the children of men. And
through the malice of BABALON I hunger, hunger, hunger.

All this while the Stone is more inert than ever yet; a thousand times
more lifeless than when it is not invoked. Now, when it kindles, it only
kindles into its physical beauty. And now upon the face of it is a great
black Rose, each of whose petals, though it be featureless, is yet a
devil-face. And all the stalks are the black snakes of hell. It is
alive, this Rose; a single thought informs it. It comes to clutch, to
murder. Yet, because a single thought alone informs it, I have hope
therein.

I think the Rose has a hundred and fifty-six petals, and though it be
black, it has the luminous blush[**52**](#52.md).

There it is, in the midst of the Stone, and I cannot see anyone who
wears it.

Aha! Aha! Aha! Shut out the sight[**53**](#53.md)!

Holy, Holy, Holy art thou!

Light, Life and Love are like three glow-worms at thy feet: the whole
universe of stars, the dewdrops on the grass whereon thou walkest!

I am quite blind[**54**](#54.md).

Thou art Nuit! Strain, strain, strain my whole soul[**55**](#55.md)!

A ka dua  
Tuf ur biu  
Bi a'a chefu  
Dudu ner af an nuteru[**56**](#56.md).

Falutli! Falutli[**57**](#57.md)!

I cling unto the burning Aethyr like Lucifer that fell through the
Abyss, and by the fury of his flight kindled the air.

And I am Belial, for having seen the Rose upon thy breast, I have denied
God.

And I am Satan! I am Satan! I am cast out upon a burning crag! And the
sea boils about the desolation thereof. And already the vultures gather,
and feast upon my flesh.

Yea! Before thee all the most holy is profane, O thou desolator of
shrines! O thou falsifier of the oracles of truth! Ever as I went, hath
it been thus. The truth of the profane was the falsehood of the
Neophyte, and the truth of the Neophyte was the falsehood of the
Zelator! Again and again the the fortress mut be battered down! pylon
must be over thrown! Again and again must the gods be desecrated!

And now I lie supine before thee, in terror and abasement. O Purity! O
Truth! What shall I say? My tongue cleaveth to my jaws, O thou Medusa
that hast turned me to stone! Yet is that stone the stone of the
philosophers. Yet is that tongue Hadit.

Aha! Aha[**58**](#58.md)!

Yea! Let me take the form of Hadit[**59**](#59.md) before thee, and sing:

A ka dua  
Tuf ur biu  
Bi a'a chefu  
Dudu ner af an nuteru.

Nuit! Nuit! Nuit! How art thou manifested in this place! This is a
Mystery ineffable. And it is mine, and I can never reveal it either to
God or to man. It is for thee and me !

Aha! Aha!

A ka dua  
Tuf ur biu  
Bi a'a chefu  
Dudu ner af an nuteru.

. . . My spirit is no more; my soul is no more. My life leaps out into
annihilation!

A ka dua  
Tuf ur biu  
Bi a'a chefu  
Dudu ner af an nuteru.

It is the cry of my body! Save me! I have come too close. I have come
too close to that which may not be endured. It must awake, the body; it
must assert itself.

It must shut out the Aethyr, or else it is dead.

Every pulse aches, and beats furiously. Every nerve stings like a
serpent. And my skin is icy cold[**60**](#60.md).

Neither God nor man can penetrate the Mystery of the Aethyr.

(Here the Seer mutters unintelligibly.)

And even that which understandeth cannot hear its voice. For to the
profane the voice of the Neophyte is called silence, and to the Neophyte
the voice of the Zelator is called silence. And so ever is it.

Sight is fire, and is the first angle of the Tablet[**61**](#61.md); spirit
is hearing, and is the centre thereof; thou, therefore, who art all
spirit and fire, and hast no duller elements in thy star; thou art come
to sight at the end of thy will. And if thou wilt hear the voice of the
Aethyr[**62**](#62.md), do thou invoke it in the night, having no other
light but the light of the half moon. Then mayest thou hear the voice,
though it may be that thou understandeth it not. Yet shall it be a
potent spell, whereby thou mayest lay bare the womb of thy understanding
to the violence of CHAOS.

Now, therefore, for the last time, let the veil of the Aethyr be torn.

Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha!

A ka dua  
Tuf ur biu  
Bi a'a chefu  
Dudu ner af an nuteru[**63**](#63.md).

. . . . . . . . . . . . .

This Aethyr must be left unfinished then until the half moon.

All this is the melody of a flute, very faint and clear. And there is
sort of a sub-tinkle of a bell.

And there is a string instrument, somewhat like a zither. And there is a
human voice.

And the voice comes: this is the Song of the Sphinx, which she singeth
ever in the ears of men.

And it is the song of the syrens. And whoever heareth it is
lost[**65**](#65.md). I III

*Translation of Song.*

**I**

Silence! the moon ceaseth (her motion),  
That also was sweet  
In the air, in the air, in the air!  
Who Will shall attain!  
Who Will shall attain  
By the Moon, and by Myself, and by the Angel of the Lord!

**II**

Now Silence ceaseth  
And the moon waxeth sweet;  
(It is the hour of) Initiation, Initiation, Initiation.  
The kiss of Isis is honeyed;  
My own Will is ended,  
For Will hath attained.

**III**

Behold the lion-child swimmeth (in the heaven)  
And the moon reeleth: --  
(It is) Thou! (It is) Thou! (It is) Thou!  
Triumph; the Will stealeth away (like a thief),  
The Strong Will that staggered  
Before Ra Hoor Khuit! -- Hadit! -- Nuit!

**IV**

To the God OAI[**66**](#66.md)  
Be praise  
In the end and the beginning!  
And may none fall  
Who Will attain  
The Sword, the Balances, the Crown!

And that which thou hearest is but the dropping of the dews from my
limbs, for I dance in the night, naked upon the grass, in shadowy
places, by running streams.

Many are they who have loved the nymphs of the woods, and of the wells,
and of the fountains, and of the hills. And of these some were
nympholept. For it was not a nymph, but I myself that walked upon the
earth taking my pleasure. So also there were many images of Pan, and men
adored them, and as a beautiful god he made their olives bear double and
their vines increase; but some were slain by the god, for it was I that
had woven the garlands about him[**67**](#67.md).

Now cometh a song.

So sweet is this song that no one could resist it. For in it is all the
passionate ache for the moonlight, and the great hunger of the sea, and
the terror of desolate places, --- all things that lure men to the
unattainable.

Omari tessala marax,  
tessala dodi phornepax.  
amri radara poliax  
armana piliu.  
amri radara piliu son';  
mari narya barbiton  
madara anaphax sarpedon  
andala hriliu.  

*Translation*

I am the harlot that shaketh Death.  
This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust.  
Immortality jetteth from my skull,  
And music from my vulva.  
Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,  
For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,  
Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,  
That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm.

Every man that hath seen me forgetteth me never, and I appear oftentimes
in the coals of the fire, and upon the smooth white skin of woman, and
in the constancy of the waterfall, and in the emptiness of deserts and
marshes, and upon great cliffs that look seaward; and in many strange
places, where men seek me not. And many thousand times he beholdeth me
not. And at last I smite myself into him as a vision smiteth into a
stone, and whom I call must follow.

Now I perceive myself standing in a Druid circle, in an immense open
plain.

A whole series of beautiful visions of deserts and sunsets and islands
in the sea, green beyond imagination . . . . But there is no subsistence
in them[**68**](#68.md).

A voice goes on: this is the holiness of fruitless love and aimless
toil. For in doing the thing for the things's sake is concentration, and
this is the holiest of them that suit not the means to the end. For
therein is faith and sympathy and a knowledge of the true
Magick[**69**](#69.md).

Oh my beloved, that fliest in the air like a dove, beware of the falcon!
oh my beloved, that springest upon the earth like a gazelle, beware of
the lion!

There are hundreds of visions, trampling over one another. In each one
the Angel of the Aethyr is mysteriously hidden.

Now I will describe the Angel of the Aethyr until the voice begins
again.

He is like one's idea of Sappho and Calypso, and all seductive and
deadly things[**70**](#70.md); heavy eye-lids, long lashes, a face like
ivory, wonderful barbaric jewellery, intensely red lips, a very small
mouth, tiny ears, a Grecian face. Over the shoulders is a black robe
with a green collar; the robe is spangled with golden stars; the tunic
is a pure soft blue.

Now the whole Aethyr is swallowed up in a forest of unquenchable fire,
and fearlessly through it all a show-white eagle flies. And the eagle
cries: the house also of death[**71**](#71.md). Come away! The volume of
the book is open, the Angel waiteth without, for the summer is at hand.
Come away! For the Aeon is measured, and thy spans allotted. Come away!
For the mighty sounds have entered into every angle[**72**](#72.md). And
they have awakened the Angels of the Aethyrs that slept these three
hundred years[**73**](#73.md).

For in the Holy letter Shin, that is the Resurrection in the Book of
Thoth, that is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, that is three hundred in
the tale of the years[**74**](#74.md), hath the tomb been opened, so that
this great wisdom might be revealed.

Come away! For the Second Triad is completed, and there remaineth only
the Lord of the Aeon, the Avenger, the Child both Crowned and
Conquering, the Lord of the Sword and the Sun, the Babe in the Lotus,
pure from his birth, the Child of suffering, the Father of justice, unto
whom be the glory throughout all the Aeon[**75**](#75.md)!

Come away! For that which was to be accomplished is accomplished, seeing
that thou hadst faith unto the end of all.

In the letter N the Voice of the Aethyr is ended[**76**](#76.md).

    {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Qof}{HEB:Nun} = 156 = BABALON, also here mentioned;
    and the whole Aethyr is devoted to HER.
2.  <span id="2"></span>This is the "Third Eye", the "Eye of Shiva", the
    Pineal Gland, supposed by some anatomists to be a rudimentary eye.
3.  <span id="3"></span>The "Bloody Sacrifice" is commonly regarded as
    "Black Magic". But this depends upon the Formula used by the
    Magician. All taking of life could be reprehensible even though
    necessary were it not for the Formula of Evolution. One should
    assume into one's own Being, ceremonially, the whole Karma of the
    creature slain; thus building it up into a higher organic structure,
    and thus helping it to fulfill its True Will of Aspiration to a
    higher Form of Life. This is, of course, a gross and material method
    of working, but it is the only method available in such cases. The
    animal is in any case doomed to death, and the most fortunate, the
    most directly profitable to it, is this immediate translation of its
    Prana (in an actual ceremony) or the basis of its Prana (in simple
    consumption at the table) into a living organism of superior type.
    It is important not to allow this Prana to escape.
4.  <span id="4"></span>There is another, even more important,
    attribution of this card.  
    The Bowman is the father ({HEB:Yod} of {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}
    {HEB:Yod}) and the Man, the Son ({HEB:Vau}). The Women are Isis and
    Nephthys ({HEB:Heh} and {HEB:Heh} final); and the whole symbolizes a
    Formula of the Highest Magick, too obscure and too elaborate to
    treat in this elementary document.
5.  <span id="5"></span>This child is really Seth, Set, Sol, Hadit.
    Abel's blood was the seed of this Seth. Remember that Abel = Baal
6.  <span id="6"></span>"Miracles" of this order constantly occur in the
    course of operations of Magick. They are by-products.
7.  <span id="7"></span>There is no question in my mind that this
    explanation is correct from the viewpoint of profane scholarship.
    "Angels" who offer absurd theories about material affairs are false
    elementals who amuse themselves at the expense of the naivet of the
    would-be- Magician.
8.  <span id="8"></span>In any case forecasts of the future cannot be
    made from Qabalistic data, which have nothing to do with terrestrial
    measures of time; e.g. to say that King Brahmadatta reigned 120,000
    years in Benares, only means that he reigned in a manner congruous
    with the ideas symbolized by 120 and, on a very grand scale, as
    indicated by the multiplication by 1000.
9.  <span id="9"></span>The allusion may be to one of those who occupied
    for a time the post of "Scarlet Woman". See *Book 4*, part 4, for a
    list of these women. (Note. - A.C. pencilled in the margin of his
    *Eqx.* here "Myriam Deroxe?" Opposite the next paragraph re. the
    white Rose he annotated "Leila Waddell?"
10. <span id="10"></span>In fact, the Seer was the prey of an
    intolerable uneasiness akin to fear. He was intuitively aware of the
    terrific nature of the Aethyr, and felt oppressed by the
    responsibility of seeing and hearing accurately in a manner of such
    dread importance. He felt even before penetrating the Aire, that he
    was already near the limit of his powers.
11. <span id="11"></span>It was not that the Call of the Aethyr had been
    ill performed, or that its virtue and efficacy were impaired. It was
    that the Seer being attached to his human instrument, that
    instrument automatically strove with all its might to escape the
    impact of so tremendous and so dire an energy which would infallibly
    be transmitted (to a certain small extent) through the Seer to it.
    In the same way, in a much lesser manner, there is a limit to the
    degree of pain a man can inflict on himself, as experiments with the
    Boulometer (the instrument invented by the Seer to measure this
    virtue) have shewn. (Note - it was a self-adjustable thumb screw. -
    Note by Yorke)
12. <span id="12"></span>This means more than the obvious. "The colours
    of the spectrum compose pure White Light." The Seer could see these
    colours directly, at the same time as the White. Another case of
    hypperabyssic logic.
13. <span id="13"></span>This doctrine is most profound and important.
    It throws light upon the mystery of evil, and upon the nature of
    Maya in general.
14. <span id="14"></span>Chaos is here the Yod of Tetragrammaton, his
    daughter the final H. This passage is to be studied closely in
    connection with the previous passages and notes with regard to the
    formula of {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod};indeed one should
    preform samyama upon this whole matter.
15. <span id="15"></span>Note well this thesis. Anything which is not
    Pure Nothing is ipso facto unbalanced, and therefore imperfect ---
    indeed illusory.
16. <span id="16"></span>The path of Beth. Contrast this way of illusion
    forcibly with the obsession of Microprosopus by Dath. (There are
    also the difficulties of the Son with the glamour of the path of
    Gimel and of the Father with the path of Aleph. See 3rd Aire
    concerning the Three Ways of Delusion that guard the Crown.)
17. <span id="17"></span>52 = {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph},
    the fertile mother = 3 = Binah. 26 =
    {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}; also {HEB:Dalet}
    {HEB:Bet}{HEB:Koph} = Kabad, the husband of the impure Lilith, and 1
    plus 6 plus 9 plus 10, the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar, the
    Phallus. 6 = 1 plus 2 plus 3, the Mystic number of Binah; also {Sun}
    who shines on all alike: {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Bet}{HEB:Gemel} to collect,
    {HEB:Bet} {HEB:Dalet} a bear (Venus in Furs), and
    {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh} a window, the illicit way of ingress into a
    house. 12 = {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh} the title of Kether, the
    Unity; 13 = {HEB:Dalet} {HEB:Chet} {HEB:Aleph} = Unity.
18. <span id="18"></span>39 =
    {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Chet}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}
    {HEB:Yod} "Tetragrammaton is One", although He is composed of 4
    letters, hence the triumph over the power of 4, limitation. But this
    explanation is not as clear, satisfactory and convincing with that
    singular feeling of ecstatic illumination which one rightly demands
    of the Qabalistic demonstration. There should be some further
    gematria of 39 not yet discovered. 2 is Beth, Atu I, Mayan the Great
    Scorceror. 78 = Mezla ({HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Zain} {HEB:Mem})
    the Influence from Kether, and the number of the Tarot Cards. I.e.,
    she destroys him by his own energies. {WEH Note: In traditional
    Qabalah Mezla is not the Influence from Kether, but the omnipresence
    of Limitless Light of Ain.}
19. <span id="19"></span>Because she includes her daughter (10) in her
    own formula, she can use the daughter for Her own purposes.
20. <span id="20"></span>This reversal of the evident exoteric meaning
    of the Call is stupendous. This book, 418, is full of similar
    interpretations "by the rule of contraries". But this rule must be
    applied with skill and discretion, if error is to be avoided. It is
    a lamentable fact that a worthy Zelator of A.{SUP:.}. A.{SUP:.}.,
    one Frater Achad, having been taught (patiently enough) by the Seer
    to use this formula, was lured by his vanity to suppose that he had
    discovered it himself, and proceeded to apply it indiscriminately.
    He tried to stand the Serpent of Wisdom on its head, and argued that
    as he was a 1x = 10{square x} of the Order, he must equally be a 10x
    = 1{square x}. As *The Book of Lies* says, "I wrenched DOG backwards
    to find God; now God barks!" He would have been better advised to
    reverse his adored ONE and taken a dose of ENO! (ENO, an English
    purgative. T.)
21. <span id="21"></span>The infinity of Nuit.
22. <span id="22"></span>The infinity of Hadit.
23. <span id="23"></span>i.e. an "Event, the fundamental unit of
    Manifested Existence.
24. <span id="24"></span>In Kelly's original: "It repenteth Me that I
    have made Man." Kelly was in constant trouble with his education as
    an orthodox Christian; also Dee forced him to reject the True
    Messengers, whose discourse implied antinomian Pantheism.
25. <span id="25"></span>One general application of the Law of Thelema.
    It is a stupid error to try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear;
    it hurts both parties to the transaction. The basic blunder is to
    set up an arbitrary ideal standard of "what ought to be". The "evil
    beginnings" on all planes have a proper and a useful function. A
    strong healthy man cannot be made by putting him in irons and
    protecting him artificially from all the "dangers of life."
26. <span id="26"></span>The passage is criticism of an obscure doctrine
    of the Qabalah. There is however a real mystery behind the rhetoric.
    {WEH Note: The doctrine in Qabalah is that the Aleph remained in the
    mouth of the Creator, and Beth was the first letter to manifest.
    This comes partly from Aleph being the first letter and partly from
    Aleph being unpronouncable without another letter. Aleph is a pure
    aspirant. Beth in Hebrew signifies "in" as in "in the beginning".
    What does all This bear on Crowley's use of "Hadit" from the Stele,
    in place of the more common "BaHadit", Egyptian for entrance into
    the Winged Disk of the Sun?}
27. <span id="27"></span>All these passages in brackets are the
    *currente lingua* explanations of the Seer (to himself) as each new
    phrase of the text was delivered by the Angel. To understand how
    startling it all was to him, one must remember that he had been
    using this Call, in its own obvious sense, for many weeks, and
    always with the utmost force and solemnity. His only warning had
    been the intuitive feeling that the Call was really a rejoicing at
    the opening of the 9th Aire. And he had thought this merely
    subjective, due to the relief of having passed through the Abyss.
28. <span id="28"></span>This was certainly due to no ordinary cause.
    The Seer was lying on the roof of the Hotel Royal at Biskra in the
    shade of the minaret. It was a cool bright morning.
29. <span id="29"></span>Prometheus stole the fire of Jupiter. Ixion
    attempted the virtue of Juno. The Seer, in trying to penetrate this
    most holy Aire, was similarly presumptious.
30. <span id="30"></span>He was using the Sign of the Rending of the
    Veil, (See *Liber O, Eqx*. I, No. 2) against the obscurity of the
    Aire.
31. <span id="31"></span>i.e. the Magister Templi. See 6th Aethyr et al.
    supra. Only a Magus can truly pierce the veil of BABALON. It is
    written (of Isis), "No man (i.e., Nemo, the Magister Templi) hath
    lifted my veil." But to lift it and look upon HER is one thing; to
    possess HER another!
32. <span id="32"></span>The physical exhaustion of the Seer was
    complete. He realized that further effort was impossible; and ---
    more also! --- that had he suddenly succeeded, while in this state,
    the fury of the impact of the Energy of the Aire would have been
    instantly destructive of his physical form.
33. <span id="33"></span>Hammam Salahin: Sulphurous waters, admirably
    apt to the idea of BABALON, whom the Seer intuitively understood to
    be the Soul of this Second Aire.
34. <span id="34"></span>Black for Binah. The pyramid for the phallus,
    for she is also androgyne. Or, as an unit of Her City, beneath the
    Night of Pan. See 14th Aire.
35. <span id="35"></span>The most perfect and mysterious of the symbols
    of the Feminine Principle. Its mathematical correspondences are of
    the greatest importance. See *The Canon* and several other treatises
    on Qabalistic Geometry.
36. <span id="36"></span>This is the last desperate attempt of the Rauch
    of the Seer to escape the Terror of the Presence of Babalon.
37. <span id="37"></span>i.e. the Magister Templi.
38. <span id="38"></span>This apparently simple phrase conceals an
    allusion of the most sublime and terrific import. See *AL* I, 14,
    16, 19. Also *The Book of Lies*, caps. 4 and 15. Mohammed said,
    "Cursed be he that maketh himself Earth, and Woman Heaven!" For he
    understood this Formula as of enormous Magical Power and wished to
    keep it from the profane, who might abuse it, or injure themselves
    by ignorant of imprudent application.
39. <span id="39"></span>See *The Book of Lies*, Cap. 3.
40. <span id="40"></span>This seems to refer to Thmaist, whose Aeon will
    succeed that of Horus. She is Atu VIII referring to Libra, the House
    of Venus. In her also, then, is BABALON the Ageless Virgin-Harlot,
    our Mother as our Concubine.
41. <span id="41"></span>Cf. 3rd Aire, the vision of Lilith. This
    triangle seems to symbolize Limitation or Restriction; or so the
    sequel implies.
42. <span id="42"></span>The path of {HEB:Dalet}, Daleth. BABALON is
    thus shewn as more than merely Binah.
43. <span id="43"></span>Tiphareth is below Her.
44. <span id="44"></span>Dath, the outcast into the Abyss, beneath Her.
45. <span id="45"></span>Chokmah, the Highest Wisdom.
46. <span id="46"></span>As shewn in the previous note, the Magister
    Templi, though he can lift Her Veil and behold Her with
    understanding, is unable to meet Her as an equal and possess Her.
47. <span id="47"></span>This has its hilt in Kether, and its point in
    Malkuth. the Seer uses the entire Hierarchy of Existence against the
    destroyer of Osiris.
48. <span id="48"></span>His energy is transmuted into the primeval
    Manifestation of the Divine Will.
49. <span id="49"></span>i.e. She is wholly set upon Kether. Only when
    Her Lover is wholly in His loftiest Selfhood can He possess Her.
50. <span id="50"></span>The Serpent of Wisdom, the 22 Paths which join
    the 10 Sephiroth. It is thus the complement of the Flaming Sword.
    The legend of Heva and Nachash is drawn from the mystical Doctrine
    here in question. This Serpent is the totality of Magical
    Manifestation, the Beauty of the 22 Palaces (Atu) of Wisdom. She is
    at once the Mother and the Sister of Her adulterous Lord, Mayan, the
    Logos who created the universe of illusion.
51. <span id="51"></span>Generally speaking, the monsters which inhabit
    water symbolize evil --- in all senses, from the grossest to the
    most exalted. They represent the falling into Passivity; whereras
    the Activity of Energy is the Idea of Joy.
52. <span id="52"></span>This Black Rose is then the veil of BABALON
    Herself. It is the repulsiveness which is one half of Fascination.
53. <span id="53"></span>Thus suddenly - BABALON - breaks through to her
    lover.
54. <span id="54"></span>This is meant in its normal physical sense. The
    Seer supposed at the time that he had actually lost his sight.
55. <span id="55"></span>Against the appalling conviction that he had
    been stricken blind for his presumption in daring to aspire to
    BABALON in so intimate a sense he gathered himself together in a
    furious assault upon Her.
56. <span id="56"></span>From the Stele of Revealing.
57. <span id="57"></span>The outburst of the orgasm (see Note 3, page
    38). It continued unabated throughout the whole of the vision. The
    Seer was all this time seated in the water of the hot spring,
    struggling with all the pressure on his body, and roaring aloud in
    the intensity of his agony or ecstasy. This helped him to endure
    physically the continuous spasm of Joy.
58. <span id="58"></span>AHA = {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} = 7. It
    is therefore a God-name of Venus. Interpreted by Yetziratic
    attribution, it is "The Crossing of our Lady ({HEB:Heh} = the
    Supernal Mother) in the air ({HEB:Aleph})." It is also the Pentagram
    between two Swastikas. The symbolism of this word, simple as it is,
    is far too extensive to discuss adequately in a note. It must be
    studied intimately and at length by the Postulant
59. <span id="59"></span>Hadit is a mathematical expression rather than
    a God. By his form is meant the Winged Globe, which is used in the
    Stele of Revealing to represent Him.
60. <span id="60"></span>This was in a pool almost inconveniently hot to
    the normal sense.
61. <span id="61"></span>Meaning, the four watchtowers of the universe
    (*Eqx*. I, VII). For the attributions of the Senses to the Elements
    see *777*. The growing intelligibility of the words indicates the
    exhaustion of the rapture of the Seer. The gradual withdrawal of the
    immanence of BABALON.
62. <span id="62"></span>Hitherto, the intellectual content of the
    Aethyr has been marked by the Moral (or rather Spiritual) Ravishment
    of the Seer by BABALON.
63. <span id="63"></span>At this point the Seer sank back exhausted. The
    Scribe, fearing that he might be drowned, assisted him to come out
    of the Pool.
64. <span id="64"></span>This began instantly on the resumption of the
    Vision. We must assume that the Angel of the Aire, or one of His
    ministers, undertook the task of preparing the Seer for the "voice
    of the Aethyr" in this manner. --- It is the language of the
    Sappho-Calypso angel, commonly called Bathyllic. Its translation is:
    "Now it glides in to the heaven-home, glides. Seducingly the
    mentrila of the begotten one of the Holy Head (or Skull) takes hold
    of the soft tissues, subtly plying its shuttle. Light follows the
    explosion. The soft tissues, cleaving to the shuttle, pump out every
    drop of water from the well."
65. <span id="65"></span>The Magical Fascination of the whole Aethyr is
    something quite apart from, and beyond, almost anything else in the
    experience of the seer. The effort upon him, 31 Equinoxes later, of
    writing these notes, is quite extraordinary. The memory of it
    diminishes the value of the rest of his life, with few excepted
    incidents, almost to nothing.
66. <span id="66"></span>The reversal of the formula of IAO (see *Book
    4*, part 3) implies roughly, the general Mystical, as opposed to the
    general Magical, Process.
67. <span id="67"></span>From this it would appear that BABALON (who is
    speaking through one of Her ministers) is the Feminine (or
    Androgyne) equivalent and not merely complement --- of Pan. This is
    shewn in many of Her images.
68. <span id="68"></span>These visions are semi-distractions, due to the
    Seer's human weakness, which could not endure the rapture of the
    Voice. "Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy."
    *AL*, II, 70. During the great revelation of the Cairo Working, the
    Seer had been similarly ravished, and fainted under the excess of
    Enthusiasm.
69. <span id="69"></span>*AL* I, 44. "For pure will, unassuaged of
    purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect."
    This doctrine is fundamental to all working soever. Its neglect
    vitiates (by a paradox curious enough) all fruitfulness in any
    operation. One may indeed distinguish work worthy of being performed
    from menial toil (such as that of statesmen, financiers, and sewer
    rats) by this criterion. (Faith, spelt empirically {GRK:phi}
    {GRK:alpha} {GRK:iota} {GRK:theta} --- a practice not to be
    commended or even defended -- it being of the nature of paranomasia
    -- is equivalent to {HEB:Resh}{HEB:Shin} {HEB:Koph} --- lawful.)
70. <span id="70"></span>BABALON, "in whom all power is given," is the
    Teh, Sakhi, {HEB:Heh}. She is seductive and deadly, being the
    Disturber of the Total Equilibrium of the Absolute Zero, which
    considered as a positive Idea, is Existence in perfect Peace, an
    immutable Essence. But He cannot truly exist without Her; and
    through Her therefore comes Change, which is Love and Death.
71. <span id="71"></span>See the 11th Call, which invokes {Spirit} of
    {Water}, the Princess of the Lotus of the Floods. (The reading is a
    variant of that given in the official A{.·.} A{.·.} ritual.) The
    Eagle is snow-white for Her purity; and He is the White Eagle of the
    Alchemists.
72. <span id="72"></span>See the Keys or Calls, especially the 5th and
    6th, where the angels (of the watchtowers) are specifically
    mentioned.
73. <span id="73"></span>That is, since the working of Sir Edward Kelly
    and Dr. John Dee.
74. <span id="74"></span>Shin=300. Also Shin is Atu XX - the Last
    Judgment (or Resurrection, as implied in the usual form of the Atu).
    Shin is Spirit in the regular attribution (the triple tongue of
    Fire; see the Acts of the Apostles). 300=Ruach Elohim (Resh, Vau,
    Cheth and Aleph, Lamed, Heh, Yod, Mem), the spirit of the gods.
75. <span id="75"></span>The Seer had absolutely forgotten this
    prophecy, and was amazed at the final identification of the child in
    LIL with Hoor.
76. <span id="76"></span>This implies that the Voice of the Aethyr ends
    never! For N is the vinration which continues through the nostrils.
    See Magick in Theory and Practice, pp. 45-47, on the word AUMGN;
    whereby the Seer rebuked and perfected the AUM of the Rishis. N
    Equals Nun, the letter of sexual immortality, the formula of
    perfection through putrefaction.
