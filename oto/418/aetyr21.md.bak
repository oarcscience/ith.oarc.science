**The Cry of the 21st Aethyr,  
Which is Called ASP**[**1**](#1.md)

A mighty wind rolls through all the Aethyr; there is a sense of absolute
emptiness; no colour, no form, no substance. Only now and then there
seem as it were, the shadows of great angels, swept along. No sound;
there is something very remorseless about the wind, passionless, that is
very terrible. In a way, it is nerve-shaking. It seems as if something
kept on trying to open behind the wind, and just as it is about to open,
the effort is exhausted. The wind is not cold or hot; there is no sense
of any kind connected with it. One does not even feel it, for one is
standing in front of it.

Now, the thing opens behind, just for a second, and I catch a glimpse of
an avenue of pillars, and at the end a throne, supported by sphinxes.
All this is black marble[**2**](#2.md).

Now I seem to have gone through the wind, and to be standing before the
throne; but he that sitteth thereon is invisible. Yet it is from him
that all this desolation proceeds[**3**](#3.md).

He is trying to make me understand by putting tastes in my mouth, very
rapidly one after the other. Salt, honey, sugar[**4**](#4.md), assafoetida,
bitumen, honey again, some taste that I don't know at all; garlic,
something very bitter like nux vomica, another taste, still more bitter;
lemon, cloves, rose-leaves, honey again; the juice of some plant, like a
dandelion, I think; honey again, salt, a taste something like
phosphorus, honey, laurel, a very unpleasant taste which I don't know,
coffee, then a burning taste, then a sour taste that I don't know. All
these tastes issue from his eyes; he *signals* them.

I can see his eyes now. They are very round, with perfectly black
pupils, perfectly white iris, and the cornea pale blue. The sense of
desolation is so acute that I keep on trying to get away from the
vision[**5**](#5.md).

I told him that I could not understand his taste-language, so instead he
set up a humming very much like a big electric plant with dynamos going.

Now the atmosphere is deep night-blue; and by the power of that
atmosphere, the pillars kindle to a dull glowing crimson, and the throne
is a dull, ruddy gold[**6**](#6.md). And now, through the humming, come
very clear, bell-like notes, and farther still a muttering, like that of
a gathering storm.

And now I hear the meaning of the muttering: I am he who was before the
beginning, and in my desolation I cried aloud, saying, let me behold my
countenance in the concave of the abyss[**7**](#7.md). And I beheld, and
lo! in the darkness of the abyss my countenance was black, and empty,
and distorted[**8**](#8), that was (once.md) invisible and pure.

Then I closed mine eye, that I might not behold it, and for this was it
fixed. Now it is written that one glance of mine eye shall destroy
it[**9**](#9.md). And mine eye I dare not open, because of the foulness of
the vision. Therefore do I gaze with these two eyes throughout the
aeon[**10**](#10.md). Is there not one of all my adepts that shall come
unto me, and cut off mine eyelids, that I may behold and
destroy[**11**](#11.md)?

Now I take a dagger, and, searching out his third eye, seek to cut off
the eye-lids, but they are of adamant. And the edge of the
dagger[**12**](#12.md) is turned.

And tears[**13**](#13.md) drop from his eyes, and there is a mournful
voice: So it hath been ever: so must it ever be! Though thou hast the
strength of five bulls, thou shalt not avail in this[**14**](#14.md).

And I said to him: Who shall avail? And he answered me: I know
not[**15**](#15). But the dagger of penance[**16**](#16.md) thou shalt
temper seven times, afflicting the seven courses of thy soul. And thou
shalt sharpen its edge seven times by the seven ordeals.

(One keeps on looking round to try to find something else because of the
terror of it. But nothing changes[**17**](#17.md) at all. Nothing but the
empty throne, and the eyes, and the avenue of pillars!)

And I said to him: O thou that art the first countenance before
time[**18**](#18.md); thou of whom it is written that "He, God, is one; He
is the eternal one, without equal, son or companion. Nothing shall stand
before His face[**19**](#19.md)"; all we have heard of thine infinite glory
and holiness, of thy beauty and majesty, and behold! there is nothing
but this abomination of desolation.

He speaks; I cannot hear a word; something about *The Book of the Law*.
The answer is written in *The Book of the Law*, or something of that
sort[**20**](#20.md).

This is a long speech; all that I can hear is: From me pour down the
fires of life and increase continually upon the earth. From me flow down
the rivers of water and oil and wine. From me cometh forth the wind that
beareth the seed of trees and flowers and fruits and all herbs upon its
bosom. From me cometh forth the earth in her unspeakable variety. Yea!
all cometh from me, naught cometh to me. Therefore am I lonely and
horrible upon this unprofitable throne. Only those who accept nothing
from me can bring anything to me.

(He goes on speaking again: I cannot hear a word. I may have got about a
twentieth of what he said.) And I say to him: It was written that his
name is Silence, but thou speakest continually.

And he answers: Nay, the muttering that thou hearest is not my voice. It
is the voice of the ape[**21**](#21.md).

(When I say that he answers, it means that it is the same voice. The
being on the throne has not uttered a word.) I say: O thou ape that
speakest for Him whose name is Silence, how shall I know that thou
speakest truly His thought? And the muttering continues: Nor speaketh He
nor thinketh, so that which I say is true, because I lie in speaking His
thoughts[**22**](#22.md).

He goes on, nothing stops him; and the muttering comes so fast that I
cannot hear him at all.

Now the muttering has ceased, or is overwhelmed by the bells, and the
bells in their turn are overwhelmed by the whirring, and now the
whirring is overwhelmed by the silence. And the blue light is gone, and
the throne and the pillars are returned to blackness, and the eyes of
him that sitteth upon the throne are no more visible.

I seek to go up close to the throne, and I am pushed back, because I
cannot give the sign. I have given all the signs I know and am entitled
to[**23**](#23.md), and I have tried to give the sign that I know and am
not entitled to[**24**](#24.md), but have not the necessary appurtenance;
and even if I had, it would be useless; for there are two more signs
necessary[**25**](#25.md).

I find that I was wrong in suggesting[**26**](#26.md) that a Master of the
Temple had a right to enter the temple of a Magus or an Ipsissimus. On
the contrary, the rule that holds below, holds also above. The higher
you go, the greater is the distance from one grade to
another[**27**](#27.md).

I am being slowly pushed backwards down the avenue, out into the wind.
And this time I am caught up by the wind and whirled away down it like a
dead leaf.

And a great Angel sweeps through the wind, and catches hold of me, and
bears me up against it; and he sets me down on the hither side of the
wind, and he whispers in my ear: Go thou forth into the world, O thrice
and four times blessed who hast gazed upon the horror of the loneliness
of The First[**28**](#28.md). No man shall look upon his face and live. And
thou hast seen his eyes, and understood his heart, for the voice of the
ape is the pulse of his heart and the labouring of his breast. Go,
therefore, and rejoice, for thou art the prophet of the Aeon arising,
wherein He is not[**29**](#29.md).

Give thou praise unto thy lady Nuit, and unto her lord Hadit, that are
for thee and thy bride, and the winners of the ordeal X[**30**](#30.md).

And with that we are come to the wall of the Aethyr, and there is a
little narrow gate, and he pushes me through it, and I am suddenly in
the desert.

The Desert, near Bou Sada[**31**](#31.md).  
November 29, 1909. 1:30 - 2:50 p.m.

1.  <span id="1"></span>ASP = {Taurus}{Virgo}{Leo} =
    {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Tet} = 25 = {HEB:Dalet} {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Heh}
    {HEB:Yod} = Jehevid, God of Geburah of Briah = {HEB:Aleph}
    {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod} {HEB:Chet} The Beast. The aire shows the
    supplanting of that by this. (A's MS. has "Mythus (?)" for "by
    this".) Taurus is Osiris. Virgo the Virgin (the lonely one). These
    are the Dying God symbols, which Leo --- the Lion, Atu XI, The Beast
    --- replaces.
2.  <span id="2"></span>This setting symbolizes the Way of Time in the
    Temple of Inscrutable Destiny.
3.  <span id="3"></span>This Deity is Necessity or Fate. This whole Aire
    is of a metaphysic more difficult to understand than any of the
    earlier. The student must have finally shut out of his mind not only
    the crude ideas of Good and Evil, but the most fundamental logical
    conceptions, such as that of being obliged to think of a state of
    mind, or an individual, as being true to itself. This God is at the
    same time an Abomination and a supreme Overlord. One may indeed say
    that the student ought to be in a state not far from Samadhi before
    meditating the meaning of the Aire.
4.  <span id="4"></span>Salt Water or Earth, probably

    Translation: "The Earth is sick of love; with disease and death is
    she sick ... the natural lust, fierce as it is, is not enough;
    virgins, boys woman (make men) sick, weak of semen and sick. The
    earth shall be cured of her sickness by true Art-of-Sun, and thine
    own pleasures, and thou ..., shall abolish the world's woe, and
    bring on the Age of Righteousness.
5.  <span id="5"></span>Black, white, and pale blue, there is no
    *warmth* in Destiny. It is intolerable to see the mere mechanism of
    life.
6.  <span id="6"></span>Now comes the warm Night-Blue of Nuit and of
    Ra-Hoor-Khuit. The pillars assume the crimson of Binah, and the
    throne, the gold of Tiphereth. Thus is it as if Ra-Hoor-Khuit were
    alive in the midst of the Womb of His Mother.
7.  <span id="7"></span>cf. the account of the beginning in the
    Upanishads.
8.  <span id="8"></span>See Eliphaz Levi's drawing of the two
    Countenances.
9.  <span id="9"></span>The Shivaite Dogma. (This is a reference to the
    philosophical notion that if Shiva opened his eyes, the universe
    would be destryed. I. R.)
10. <span id="10"></span>See the *Kaballah Unveiled* by McGregor
    Mathers. The Most Holy Ancient One has One Eye: Microprosophus two.
11. <span id="11"></span>Shiva again. For the eyelids, see above, the
    22nd Aire, the speech of the Babe Horus.
12. <span id="12"></span>This minor elemental weapon is evidently
    useless against fundamental ideas like force and matter, of which it
    is itself but a trivial complex.
13. <span id="13"></span>Binah, Mother of Sorrow - the tears from the
    Great Sea, her symbol. The first issue of understanding of the
    trance of sorrow.
14. <span id="14"></span>The Bull = Taurus = Vau = V. The motto of the
    Seer is in the grade of Binah, 8° = 3°, is V.V.V.V.V., the five
    bulls. He had already chosen this motto, though he had refused to
    accept the grade when offered to him three years before by the
    chiefs, after the episode of crossing the Abyss during the walk
    across the lower borders of China. We now approach those Aethyrs in
    which his full initiation to that grade was accomplished.
15. <span id="15"></span>I = {HEB:Yod}{HEB:Nun}{HEB:Aleph} = 61. Know =
    No ={HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Lamed} = 31. Not =
    {HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph} = 61. Also I know not --- I know
    that which is Not. Such are the roots of the Equation of Ambiguity,
    used often by Higher Intelligences (especially in *The Book of the
    Law*, q.v.) to prove their identity as Individuals separate from the
    Seer, and superior to him.
16. <span id="16"></span>This rebukes the Seer for having tried to use
    the elemental Dagger. Perhaps the four sevens in the injunction
    refer to Netzach, Victory. For Netzach = 7; and 28 = {GRK:Sigma}1-7
    as well as 4x7, 28 is a "perfect" number; its factors add up to
    itself.
17. <span id="17"></span>That is the extreme horror: for Change is Life,
    the issue of love.
18. <span
    id="18"></span>{HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Peh}{HEB:Nun}{HEB:Aleph}
    {HEB:Koph- final}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Resh}{HEB:Aleph} The Great
    Countenance (which beheld not Countenance).
19. <span id="19"></span>The Chapter of the Unity, in the Qu'ran.
20. <span id="20"></span>This may refer to the Formula 0 = 2.
21. <span id="21"></span>Kether, of course, does not speak. His Nature
    is made apparent by Thoth, the Logos, the Creative Word. But this
    Word must evidently be false, since He is Silence. Thoth, however,
    is himself accompanied by the Cynocephalos, the dog-headed Ape, who
    imitates and caricatures all His actions, and misinterprets His
    speech.
22. <span id="22"></span>The idea is that Truth may be stated by denying
    a falsehood. This lands us in the quagmires of "Zigzagginess", the
    paradox of Epaminoneas, et hoc genus omne. One great point of the
    Initiated Doctrine is that the Ruach (the Mechanism of Thought) is
    in its essential nature self-contradictory. From now on, the Angels
    of the Aethyrs begin to speak in the language of Neshamah; they use
    the logic which pertains above the Abyss. The student will,
    accordingly, find statements which must be reversed and reversed
    again and again; both are true and false at once; neither is true or
    false --- and so on.
23. <span id="23"></span>The sign of the Grades up to 7x = 4{square x}.
24. <span id="24"></span>the sign of 8x = 3{square x}.
25. <span id="25"></span>The signs of 9x = 2{square x} and 10x =
    1{square x}; necessary because this Vision pertains to Kether.
26. <span id="26"></span>See the "Wake World" in *Konx Om Pax*.
27. <span id="27"></span>See *One Star in Sight*.
28. <span id="28"></span>Observe the point-of-view, so totally opposite
    to any ever previously set forth, about the psychology of Kether.
29. <span id="29"></span>In the Ontology of the New Aeon, whose prime
    theorem is 0 = 2, Kether exists only as the Child of any Marriage of
    one particular Hadit with one particular aspect of Nuit. There are
    thus as many Kethers as there are positive possibilities. More,
    Kether is not in any case a sole Unity, for each Marriage produces a
    Twin, {HEB:Heh} + {HEB:Yod} = {HEB:Heh} + {HEB:Vau}. There is a
    positive "Third Being", a Kether; and there is an Ecstasy, or
    dissolution into Nothing, by the same Event. One is the Magical, the
    other the Mystical, Result of an Act of Love under Will.
30. <span id="30"></span>See *Liber AL* III, v. 22.
31. <span id="31"></span>this night I took the shew-stone to my breast
    to sleep, and immediately a Dhyana arose of the sun, seen more
    clearly afterwards as the Star. Exceeding was its brilliance.
