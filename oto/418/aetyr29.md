# **The Cry of the 29th Aethyr, Which is Called RII**[**1**](#1.md)

The sky appears covered with stars of gold; the background is of green.
But the impression is also of darkness.

An immense eagle-angel is before me. His wings seem to hide all the
Heaven[**2**](#2.md).

He cried aloud saying: The Voice of the Lord upon the Waters: the Terror
of God upon Mankind. The voice of the Lord maketh the Skies to tremble:
the Stars are troubled: the Aires fall. The First Voice Speaketh and
saith: Cursed, cursed be the Earth, for her iniquity is great. Oh Lord!
Let Thy Mercy be lost in the great Deep! Open thine eyes of Flame and
Light, O God, upon the wicked! Lighten thine Eyes! The Clamour of Thy
Voice, let it smite down the Mountains!

Let us not see it! Cover we our eyes, lest we see the End of Man.

Close we our ears, lest we hear the cry of Woman.

Let none speak of it: let none write it: I, I am troubled, my eyes are
moist with dews of terror: surely the Bitterness of Death is past.

And I turned me to the South and lo! a great lion[**3**](#3.md) as wounded
and perplexed.

He cried: I have conquered! Let the Sons of Earth keep silence; for my
Name is become as That of Death!

When will men learn the Mysteries of Creation?

How much more those of the Dissolution (and the Pang of Fire)?

I turned me to the West and there was a great Bull[**4**](#4.md); White
with horns of White and Black and Gold. His mouth was scarlet and his
eyes as Sapphire stones. With a great sword he shore the skies asunder,
and amid the silver flashes of the steel grew lightnings and deep clouds
of Indigo.

He spake: It is finished! My mother hath unveiled herself!

My sister hath violated herself! The life of things hath disclosed its
Mystery.

The work of the Moon is done! Motion is ended for ever!

Clipped are the eagle's wings: but my Shoulders have not lost their
strength.

I heard a Great Voice from above crying: Thou liest! For the Volatile
hath indeed fixed itself; but it hath arisen above thy sight. The World
is desert: but the Abodes of the House of my Father are peopled; and His
Throne is crusted over with white Brilliant Stars, a lustre of bright
gems.

In the North is a Man upon a Great Horse, having a Scourge and
Balances[**5**](#5.md) in his hand (or a long spear glitters at his back or
in his hand). He is clothed in black velvet and his face is stern and
terrible.

He spake saying: I have judged! It is the end: the gate of the
beginning. Look in the Beneath and thou shalt see a new world!

I looked and saw a great abyss and a dark funnel of whirling waters or
fixed airs, wherein were cities and monsters and trees and atoms and
mountains and little flames (being souls) and all the material of an
universe.

And all are sucked down one by one, as necessity hath ordained. For
below is a glittering jewelled globe of gold and azure, set in a World
of Stars[**6**](#6.md).

And there came a Voice from the Abyss, saying: "Thou seest the Current
of Destiny! Canst thou change one atom in its path? I am Destiny. Dost
thou think to control me? for who can move my course?"

And there falleth a thunderbolt therein: a catastrophe of explosion: and
all is shattered. And I saw above me a Vast Arm reach down, dark and
terrible, and a voice cried: I AM ETERNITY.

And a great mingled cry arose: "No! no! no! All is changed; all is
confounded; naught is ordered: the white is stained with blood: the
black is kissed of the Christ! Return! Return! It is a new chaos that
thou findest here: chaos for thee: for us it is the skeleton of a New
Truth!"

I said: Tell me this truth: for I have conjured ye by the Mighty Names
of God, the which ye cannot but obey.

The voice said:

Light is consumed as a child in the Womb of its Mother to develop itself
anew. But pain and sorrow infinite, and darkness are invoked. For this
child riseth up within his Mother and doth crucify himself within her
bosom. He extendeth his arms in the arms of his Mother and the Light
becometh fivefold[**7**](#7.md).

Lux in Luce,

Christus in Cruce;

Tarot and Mezla.

Deo Duce

Sempiterno[**8**](#8.md).

And be the glory for ever and ever unto the Most High God, Amen!

Then I returned within my body, giving glory unto the Lord of Light and
of the Darkness. In Saecula Saeculorum. Amen!

(On composing myself to sleep, I was shewn an extremely brilliant
{HEB:Dalet}[**9**](#9.md) in the Character of the Passing of the River, in
an egg of white light. And I take this as the best of Omens. The letter
was extremely vivid and indeed apparently physical. Almost a Dhyana.)

November 17, 1900, Die.

A NOTE[**10**](#10.md)

Concerning the thirty Aethyrs:

The Visions of the 29th and 30th Aethyrs were given to me in Mexico in
August[**11**](#11), 1900, and I am now (23.11.9.md) trying to get the
rest. It is to be remarked that the last three aethyrs have ten angels
attributed to them[**12**](#12.md), and they therefore represent the ten
Sephiroth. Yet these ten form but one, a Malkuth-pendant to the next
three, and so on, each set being, as it were, absorbed in the higher.
The last set consists, therefore, of the first three aethyrs with the
remaining twenty-seven as their Malkuth. And the letters of the first
three aethyrs are the key- sigils of the most exalted interpretation of
the Sephiroth.

I is therefore Kether;

L, Chokmah and Binah;

A, Chesed;

N, Geburah;

R, Tiphereth;

Z, Netzach;

N, Hod;

O, Jesod.

The geomantic correspondences of the Enochian alphabet form a sublime
commentary.

Note that the total angels of the aethyrs are 91, the numeration of
Amen.

1.  <span id="1"></span> {Pisces}{Sagittarius}{Sagittarius} =
    {HEB:Qof}{HEB:Samekh}{HEB:Samekh} = 220. 220 is the number of verses
    of *The Book of the Law*: And this book brings about the disruption
    described in this Aethyr.
2.  <span id="2"></span> In the East. He thus represents the immediate
    future: and this is dark, Bewildering, and terrifying.
3.  <span id="3"></span>{Leo}. This is the Beast 666 as yet unprepared
    for his Work. But already (1900 e.v.) He was dreaded by his fellow
    Magicians. South: proper place of {Sun} in his strength.
4.  <span id="4"></span>The Bull is Osiris or Jesus: he complains of the
    terrible things that are Happening, especially the Freedom (which he
    thinks shamelessness) or Woman. He does not understand the New Aeon,
    or that he is about to be destroyed. He is in the West, i.e. going
    into Oblivion. Cr. West in he 30th Aethyr.
5.  <span id="5"></span>The severest aspect of Justice. Libra.
6.  <span id="6"></span>Nuit.
7.  <span id="7"></span>The LVX Cross hidden in the Svastika is probably
    the Arcanum here connoted. This Cross on Mars square adds to 65
    Adonai, Shone, Gloried, ha-Yekal HS = keep silence. Svastika itself
    adds to 231 = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + 21, the 21 Keys. The cubical
    Svastika regarded as composed of this LVX Cross and the arms has a
    total of 78 Faces
8.  <span id="8"></span>This is but the beginning of a sort of hymn. It
    was never written down, the Seer being unable to hear it properly.
    These four lines are in fact probably incorrect, certainly
    incomplete. There were four more lines which he failed to hear ---
    from fear of getting them wrong.
9.  <span id="9"></span>Daleth = the Gateway.
10. <span id="10"></span>This note, written before invoking the 28th
    Aire, represents a crude and imperfect view. It is retained so as to
    show how very inadequate was the Understanding of the Seer;
    therefore the immense superiority of the communicating Intelligences
    and Their separate individual Consciousness.
11. <span id="11"></span>Query: November ? See above.
12. <span id="12"></span>See *Equinox* I, VII, pp. 242-3.
