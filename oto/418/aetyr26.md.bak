# **The Cry of the 26th Aethyr, Which is Called DES**[**1**](#1.md)

There is a very bright pentagram: and now the stone is gone, and the
whole heaven is black, and the blackness is the blackness of a mighty
angel[**2**](#2.md). And though he is black (his face and his wings and his
robe and his armour are all black), yet is he so bright that I cannot
look upon him. And he cries: O ye spears and vials of poison and sharp
swords and whirling thunderbolts that are about the corners of the
earth[**3**](#3.md), girded with wrath and justice, know ye that His name
is Righteousness in Beauty[**4**](#4.md)? Burnt out are your eyes, for that
ye have seen me in my majesty. And broken are the drum-heads of your
ears[**5**](#5.md), because my name is as two mountains of fornication, the
breasts of a strange woman[**6**](#6.md); and my Father is not in them.

Lo! the pools of fire and torment mingled with sulphur! Many are their
colours, and their colour is as molten gold, when all is said. Is not He
one, one and alone, in whom the brightness of your countenance is as
1,728 petals of fire[**7**](#7.md).

Also he spake the curse, folding his wings across and crying: Is not the
son the enemy of his father? And hath not the daughter stolen the warmth
of the bed of her mother[**8**](#8.md)? therefore is the great curse
irrevocable. Therefore there is neither wisdom nor understanding nor
knowledge in this house, that hangeth upon the edge of hell[**9**](#9.md).
Thou art not 4 but 2, O thou blasphemy spoken against 1[**10**](#10.md).

Therefore whoso worshippeth thee is accursed. He shall be brayed in a
mortar and the powder thereof cast to the winds, that the birds of the
air may eat thereof and die; and he shall be dissolved in strong acid
and the elixir poured into the sea, that the fishes of the sea may
breathe thereof and die. And he shall be mingled with dung and spread
upon the earth, so that the herbs of the earth may feed thereof and die;
and he shall be burnt utterly with fire, and the ashes thereof shall
calcine the children of flame, that even in hell may be found an
overflowing lamentation.

And now on the breast of the Angel is a golden egg between the blackness
of the wings, and that egg[**11**](#11.md) grows and grows all over the
aethyr. And it breaks, and within there is a golden eagle.

And he cries: Woe! woe! woe! Yea, woe unto the world! For there is no
sin, and there is no salvation[**12**](#12.md). My plumes are like waves of
gold upon the sea. My eyes are brighter than the sun. My tongue is
swifter than the lightning.

Yet am I hemmed in by the armies of night, singing, singing phrases unto
Him that is smitten by the thunderbolt of the abyss. Is not the sky
clear behind the sun? These clouds that burn thee up, these rays that
scorch the brains of men with blindness; these are heralds before my
face of the dissolution and the night.

Ye are all blinded by my glory; and though ye treasure in your heart the
sacred word that is the last lever of the key to the little door beyond
the abyss, yet ye gloss and comment thereupon; for the light itself is
but illusion. Truth itself is but illusion. Yea, these be the great
illusions beyond life and space and time.

Let thy lips blister with my words! Are they not meteors in thy brain?
Back, back from the face of the accursed one, who am I; back into the
night of my father, into the silence; for all that ye deem right is
left, forward is backward, upward is downward[**13**](#13.md).

I am the great god adored of the holy ones. Yet am I the accursed one,
child of the elements and not their father[**14**](#14.md).

O my mother! wilt thou not have pity upon me? Wilt thou not shield me?
For I am naked, I am manifest, I am profane. O my father! wilt not thou
withdraw me? I am extended, I am double, I am profane.

Woe, woe unto me! These are they that hear not prayer. It is I that have
heard all prayer alway, and there is none to answer *me*. Woe unto me!
Woe unto me! Accursed am I unto the aeons! All this time this brilliant
eagle-headed god has been attacked, seemingly, by invisible
people[**15**](#15.md), for he is wounded now and again, here and there;
little streams of fresh blood come out over the feathers of his breast.
And the smoke of the blood is gradually filling the Aethyr with a
crimson veil. There is a scroll over the top, saying: *Ecclesia abhorret
a sanguine*[**16**](#16.md); and there is another scroll below it in a
language of which I do not know the sounds. The meaning is, Not as they
have understood[**17**](#17.md).

The blood is thicker and darker now, and it is becoming clotted and
black, so that everything is blotted out; because it coagulates,
coagulates. And then at the top there steals a dawn of pure night- blue
[**18**](#18.md), --- Oh, the stars, the stars in it deeply set! --- and
drives the blood down; so that all round the top of the oval gradually
dawns the figure of our Lady Nuit, and beneath her is the flaming winged
disk, and below the altar of Ra-Hoor-Khuit, even as it is upon the Stele
of Revealing[**19**](#19.md). But below is the supine figure of Seb, into
whom is concentrated all that clotted blood[**20**](#20.md).

And there comes a voice: It is the dawn of the aeon. The aeons of
cursing are passed away. Force and fire, strength and sight, these are
for the servants of the Star and the Snake.

And now I seem to be lying in the desert, exhausted[**21**](#21.md).

The Desert, near Sidi Aissa.

1.  <span id="1"></span>DES = &lt;{Virgo}{Gemini}
    ="{HEB:Zain}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Dalet}" ="31" + 10 + 7="48"
    ="{HEB:Bet}{HEB:Koph}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Koph}" ="Kokab," the sphere of
    {Mercury}. This Aethyr describes the supersession of the Aeon of
    Jehovah and Jesus. The Stele of Revealing, which led to *The Book of
    the Law, whose key number is 31. {HEB:Dalet} = D = &lt;= 31.
    I="{HEB:Yod}" ="{Virgo}" ="Nuit" and the Point, Hadit.
    S="{HEB:Zain}" ="{Gemini}" ="the" twins, Ra-Hoor-Khuit and
    Hoor-Paar-Kraat combined in Heru-Ra-Ha, the Lord of the Aeon. Also
    {Virgo} & {Gemini} are the Houses of {Mercury}, the Logos. Thus the
    name of the Aethyr actually means: The Sacred Secret Keyletter of
    *The Book of the Law of Thelema, appearing through the Operation of
    Mercury as well as gibing a complete symbolical description of the
    Stele itself. The Arcanum is of Atu XX = {HEB:Shin} = &lt;+
    {Dee}="The Last Judgment" or "The Angel". The old form of XX shows
    the Resurrection Formula of the Old Aeon: the new form shews the
    Stele of Revealing="718.&lt;P"&gt;**
2.  <span id="2"></span>The Pentagram indicates that the subject of the
    Vision is to be the Destiny of Man. The blackness, which is bright,
    is Solar. The context shows that Binah is not here implied.
3.  <span id="3"></span>All symbols of division and destruction, also
    extending only to the Blind Four Elements.
4.  <span id="4"></span>Righteousness = Jupiter --- Jehovah --- Beauty =
    Osiris --- Jesus. These are the qualities they claimed; Their
    failure is that they never even had the idea of the Supernals beyond
    the Abyss.
5.  <span id="5"></span>Hearing pertains to Spirit, as sight to fire.
    These gods have deprived man of his highest faculties.
6.  <span id="6"></span>See the 10th Key.
7.  <span id="7"></span>The Zodiac brought down to the material plane.
    12{SUP:3}
8.  <span id="8"></span>The Oedipus complex. Christianity.
9.  <span id="9"></span>The Cult of Jehovah cannot even reach to Dath.
10. <span id="10"></span>i.e. Jehovah is not even the true Chesed, but
    the evil Dyad, (as opposed to the true Dyad of Chokmah, which
    interprets Keter in terms of Vibration, the Logos.)
11. <span id="11"></span>The promise of breaking the tyranny of Jehovah,
    who was the evil 4 in the Aeon of the true 4, Isis, by the Solar
    (golden) Jesus. He appears as an eagle, the bird of Jupiter. so that
    despite the glittering hope, it was only the old Aeon all over
    again.
12. <span id="12"></span>He knows this truth, which destroys the whole
    idea of his formula. Nobody will bother about him, it they are not
    sinners, and need no saviour.
13. <span id="13"></span>Observe the loud words, the confusion of the
    thought, throughout this excited passage.
14. <span id="14"></span>He knows that he is not an image of the Simple,
    Sublime, Self, but an ill-concocted mess of Blind Forces.
15. <span id="15"></span>Jesus has been destroyed by myriads of minute
    facts; the observations of Nature which have broken down the
    theories on which his existence depended. His blood is spilt, and
    veils Truth; whereas the Blood of the Master of the Temple is
    gathered in the Cup of BABALON, and floods the world with Life and
    Beauty. (See [27th Aire](aetyr27), footnote 3.md).
16. <span id="16"></span>The Christian, incapable of the formula of the
    Master of the Temple, abhors the shedding of blood. He fears to lose
    his vile life.
17. <span id="17"></span>i.e. The meaning of the Latin is that given
    above, not the traditional ecclesiastical interpretation. Cf. also,
    AL 1, vv. 45048.
18. <span id="18"></span>Not only symbolic, but actually visible even to
    the physical eyes, when Nuit is manifested. Also when Ra-Hoor-Khuit
    is invoked, or Aiwass.
19. <span id="19"></span>See the various special accounts of the Stele.
    The New Atu XX - 718.
20. <span id="20"></span>Earth has absorbed all the ruin wrought by
    Jesus, to rebuild life through putrefaction, by her regular
    formula - as opposed to the Higher Magick.
21. <span id="21"></span>This vision, being so close to the physical
    plane, required no intermediate stations on the way back. The
    exhaustion was due to the same cause. Communion with high spiritual
    forces renews the vitality of the Seer.
