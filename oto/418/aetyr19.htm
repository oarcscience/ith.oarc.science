<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 19th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called POP</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font
        size="6"> </font></p>
<p>At first there is a black web over the face of the stone. A ray of light pierces 
  it from behind and above. Then cometh a black cross<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>, 
  reaching across the whole stone; then a golden cross, not so large. And there 
  is a writing in an arch that spans the cross, in an alphabet in which the letters 
  are all formed of little daggers<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, 
  cross-hilted, differently arranged. And the writing is: Worship in the body 
  the things of the body; worship in the mind the things of the mind; worship 
  in the spirit the things of the spirit<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>(This holy alphabet must be written by sinners, that is, by those who are impure.)<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> 
</p>
<p>&quot;Impure&quot; means those whose every thought is followed by another thought, 
  or who confuse the higher with the lower, the substance with the shadow. Every 
  Aethyr is truth, though it be but a shadow, for the shadow of a man is not the 
  shadow of an ape<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>(<em>Note</em>. --- All this has come to me without voice, without vision, 
  without thought.) </p>
<p>(The shew-stone is pressed upon my forehead and causes intense pain; as I go 
  on from Aethyr to Aethyr, it seems more difficult to open the Aethyr. </p>
<p>The golden cross has become a little narrow door, and an old man like the Hermit<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> 
  of the Taro has opened it and come out. I ask him for admission: and he shakes 
  his head kindly, and says: It is not given to flesh and blood to unveil the 
  mysteries of the Aethyr, for therein are the chariots of fire<a
        href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. and the tumult 
  of the horsemen; whoso entereth here may never look on life again with equal 
  eyes. I insist. </p>
<p>The little gate is guarded by a great green dragon. And now the whole wall 
  is suddenly fallen away; there is a blaze of the chariots and the horsemen; 
  a furious battle is raging. One hears nothing but the clash of steel and the 
  neighing of the chargers and the shrieks of the wounded. A thousand fall at 
  every encounter and are trampled under foot. Yet the Aethyr is always full; 
  there are infinite reserves. </p>
<p>No; that is all wrong, for this is not a battle between two forces, but a mle 
  in which each warrior fights for himself against all the others. I cannot see 
  one who has even one ally. And the least fortunate, who fall soonest, are those 
  in the chariots. For as soon as they are engaged in fighting, their own charioteers 
  stab them in the back<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And in the midst of the battlefield there is a great tree, like a chinar-tree<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
  Yet it bears fruits. And now all the warriors are dead, and they are the ripe 
  fruits that are fallen -- the ground is covered with them. </p>
<p>There is a laugh in my right ear: &quot;This is the tree of life<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>.&quot; 
</p>
<p>And now there is a mighty god, Sebek<a href="#12"><font
        size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, with the head of a crocodile. 
  His head is gray, like river mud, and his jaws fill the whole Aire. And he crunches 
  up the whole tree and the ground and everything. </p>
<p>Now then at last cometh forth the Angel of the Aethyr, who is like the Angel 
  of the fourteenth key of Rota<a
        href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>, with beautiful 
  blue wings, blue robes, the sun in her girdle like a brooch, and the two crescents 
  of the moon shapen into sandals for her feet. Her hair is of flowing gold, each 
  sparkle as a star. In her hands are the torch of Penelope and the cup of Circe<a href="#14"><font
        size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>She comes and kisses me on the mouth<a href="#15"><font
        size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>, and says: Blessed art thou who 
  hast beheld Sebek my Lord in his glory. Many are the champions of life, but 
  all are unhorsed by the lance of death. Many are the children of the light, 
  but their eyes shall all be put out by the Mother Darkness. Many are the servants 
  of love, but love (that is not quenched by aught but love) shall be put out, 
  as the child taketh the wick of a taper between his thumb and finger, by the 
  god that sitteth alone<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And on her mouth, like a chrysanthemum of radiant light, is a kiss, and on 
  it is the monogram I.H.S. The letters I.H.S. mean In Homini Salus and Instar 
  Hominis Summus, and Imago Hominis deuS. And there are many, many other meanings, 
  but they all imply this one thing; that nothing is of any importance but man; 
  there is no hope or help but in man<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And she says: Sweet are my kisses, O wayfarer that wanderest from star to star. 
  Sweet are my kisses, O householder that weariest within four walls. Thou art 
  pent within thy brain, and my shaft pierceth it, and thou art free. Thine imagination 
  eateth up the universe as the dragon that eateth up the moon. And in my shaft 
  is it concentrated and bound up. See how all around thee gather my warriors, 
  strong knights in goodly armour ready for war. Look upon my crown; it is above 
  the stars. Behold the glow and the blush thereof! Upon thy cheek is the breeze 
  that stirs those plumes of truth. For though I am the Angel of the fourteenth 
  key, I am also the Angel of the eighth key<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
  And from the love of these two have I come, who am the warden of Pop and the 
  servant of them that dwell therein. Though all crowns fall, mine shall not fall; 
  for my plumes reach up unto the Knees of Him that sitteth upon the holy throne, 
  and liveth and reigneth for ever and ever as the balance of righteousness and 
  truth. I am the Angel of the moon. I am the veiled one that sitteth between 
  the pillars veiled with a shining veil, and on my lap is the open Book of the 
  mysteries of the ineffable light<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. 
  I am the aspiration unto the higher; I am the love of the unknown. I am the 
  blind ache within the heart of man. I am the minister of the sacrament of pain. 
  I swing the censer of worship, and I sprinkle the waters of purification. I 
  am the daughter of the house of the invisible. I am the Priestess of the Silver 
  Star<a
        href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And she catches me up to her as a mother catches her babe, and holds me up 
  in her left arm, and sets my lips to her breast<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
  And upon her breast is written: <em>Rosa Mundi est Lilium Coeli</em><a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a> 
  squares in the midst. It radiates a blaze of light, too dazzling to make out 
  the characters, and a voice says: <em>Non haec piscis omnium</em><a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>(To interpret that, we must think of '{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta} {GRK:upsilon} 
  '{GRK:sigma}, which does not conceal <em>Iesous Christos Theon Uios Soter</em> 
  as traditionally asserted, but is a mystery of the letter Nun and the letter 
  Qoph, as may be seen by adding it up<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>.) 
</p>
<p>('{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta}{GRK:upsilon}'{GRK:sigma} is only connected 
  with Christianity because it was a hieroglyph of syphilis, which the Romans 
  supposed to have been brought from Syria; and it seems to have been confounded 
  with leprosy, which also they thought was caused by fish- eating.) </p>
<p>(One important meaning of '{GRK:Iota}{GRK:chi}{GRK:theta} {GRK:upsilon}'{GRK:sigma}: 
  it is formed of the initials of five Egyptian deities and also of five Greek 
  deities: in both cases a magic formula of tremendous power is concealed<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>As to the Holy Table itself, I cannot see it for the blaze of light; but I 
  am given to understand that it appears in another Aethyr, of which it forms 
  practically the whole content. And I am bidden to study the Holy Table very 
  intently so as to be able to concentrate on it when it appears. </p>
<p>I have grown greater, so that I am as great as the Angel. And we are standing, 
  as if crucified, face to face, our hands and lips and breasts and knees and 
  feet together, and her eyes pierce into my eyes like whirling shafts of steel, 
  so that I fall backwards headlong through the Aethyr<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a> 
  ---and there is a sudden and tremendous shout, absolutely stunning, cold and 
  brutal: Osiris was a black god<a
        href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>! And the Aethyr 
  claps its hands, greater than the peal of a thousand mighty thunders. </p>
<p>I am back. </p>

    This Aire introduces the Hegemone, or leader of the Candidate through the 
    Ceremony of Initiation. She is the Holy Guardian Angel, in the form of Isis-Urania, 
    the Instructress. {ENO:p} is {Sun} in his Northern declination, the form of 
    Horus in his strength of Summer. He appears in his dual form, as it were the 
    pillars between which the Hegemone, who bears a mitreheaded wand, symbolical 
    of the Balances, is seated. (See the Neophyte Ceremony ---<em>Equinox</em>, 
    I, II, pp. 244-261.) She is the reconciler between all opposites. (See the 
    Ceremony of the Equinox --- given in Equ. I, VII, pp. 372-5). Her function 
    is to equilibrate all symbols in the sphere of the Candidate; this is the 
    one supremely important formula of Instruction. This Aethyr contains accordingly 
    the knowledge (somewhat fragmentary at first sight) necessary to the Aspirant 
    to the Grade of Magister Templi. 48 is {HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Chet}, a woman; 
    also strength, an army. {HEB:Chet} the Bearer of the Graal; and the seed of 
    life; {HEB:Lamed} the Balances, i.e. She bears the Seed of Life in the Holy 
    Cup ion balance. 48 is {HEB:Mem-final}{HEB:Heh} Ham; see the sudden Revelation 
    at the end of the Vision.</font></li>

    Shiva. Time swallows up all ideas, all experiences, Life itself. That is a

    i.e. the Primal Water of Thales: to {HEB:Qof} because Atu XVIII shews that 
    Life appearing in the Waters of Midnight, Kephra in the Pool of Great Dark

    Sebek --- The Devourer (Time) Selene --- The Moon All these deities represent 
    divers forms and functions of the Idea of Binah. How to combine them in order 
    to obtain Magical Formulae must be studied in the light of <em>Book 4</em>, 
    Part III.</font></li>
  <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">The Seer cannot make Union with his Guide. 
    She is the feminine form of his Holy Guardian Angel; but the impulse to unite 
    is only valid when it comes from above. In the 20th Aire this was the case; 
    and so the Marriage was accomplished.</font></li>
  <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">This, to the Seer at that time, was a Revelation 
    of the most appalling terror. The doctrine of the Third Order had not been 
    promulgated. He expected to unite with the Great Mother in a Mode similar 
    to that experienced in attaining to the Knowledge and Conversation of the 
    Holy Guardian Angel. But the attainment of the Grade of Magister Templi involves 
    the Annihilation of the aspirant. &quot;Osiris was a black god&quot;; i.e. 
    of the nature of Binah--- BLACK. The love of Binah is that of the Queen Scorpion, 
    who devours her mate. This revelation therefore, was much as if a romantic 
    lover of the Richard Feveral type, were suddenly made fully aware that the 
    Maiden of his Dreams intended to conclude their First Night of Love by a Breakfast, 
    of which he was to form the staple dish! The Doctrine implied is that one 
    must not be the child, but the Mother. </font></li>
