# **The Cry of he 25th Aethyr, Which is Called VTI**[**1**](#1)

There is nothing in the stone but the pale gold of the Rosy Cross.

Now there comes an Angel with bright wings, that is the Angel of the
25th Aire. And all the aire is a dark olive about him, like an
alexandrite [**2**](#2) stone. He bears a pitcher[**3**](#3) or
amphora[**4**](#4) And now there comes another Angel upon a white
horse[**5**](#5), and yet again another Angel upon a black
bull[**6**](#6). And now there comes a lion[**7**](#7) and swallows the
two latter angels up. The first angel goes to the lion and closes his
mouth[**8**](#8). And behind them are arrayed a great company of Angels
with silver spears, like a forest. And the Angel says: Blow, all ye
trumpets, for I will loose my hands from the mouth of the lion, and his
roaring shall enkindle the worlds[**9**](#9). Then the trumpets blow,
and the wind rises and whistles terribly. It is a blue wind with silver
specks; and it blows through the whole Aethyr. But through it one
perceives the lion, which has become as a raging flame[**10**](#10). And
he roareth in an unknown tongue. But this is the interpretation thereof:
Let the stars be burnt up in the fire of my nostrils[**11**](#11)! Let
all the gods and the archangels and the angels and the spirits that are
on the earth, and above the earth, and below the earth, that are in all
the heavens and in all the hells, let them be as motes dancing in the
beam of mine eye[**12**](#12)! I am he that swalloweth up
death[**13**](#13) and victory[**14**](#14). I have slain the crowned
goat[**15**](#15), and drunk up the great sea[**16**](#16). Like the ash
of dried leaves the worlds are blown before me. Thou hast passed by me,
and thou hast not known me. Woe unto thee, that I have not devoured thee
altogether! On my head is the crown, 419 rays[**17**](#17) far-darting.
And my body is the body of the Snake[**18**](#18), and my soul is the
soul of the Crowned Child[**19**](#19). Though an Angel in white robes
leadeth me[**20**](#20), - who shall ride upon me but the Woman of
Abominations[**21**](#21)? Who is the Beast[**22**](#22)? Am not I one
more than he[**23**](#23)? In his hand is a sword that is a
book[**24**](#24). In his hand is a spear that is a cup of
fornication[**25**](#25). Upon his mouth is set the great and terrible
seal[**26**](#26). And he hath the secret of V[**27**](#27). His ten
horns spring from five points[**28**](#28), and his eight
heads[**29**](#29) are as the charioteer of the West[**30**](#30). Thus
doth the fire of the sun temper the spear of Mars[**31**](#31), and thus
shall he be worshipped, as the warrior lord of the sun[**32**](#32). Yet
in him is the woman that devoureth with her water all the fire of
God[**33**](#33). Alas! my lord, thou art joined with him that knoweth
not these things[**34**](#34). When shall the day come that men shall
flock to this my gate, and fall into my furious throat, a whirlpool of
fire? This is hell unquenchable, and all they shall be utterly consumed
therein. Therefore is that asbestos unconsumable made pure[**35**](#35).
Each of my teeth[**36**](#36) is a letter of the reverberating name. My
tongue is a pillar of fire[**37**](#37), and from the glands of my mouth
arise four pillars of water[**38**](#38).TAOTZEM[**39**](#39){SUP:19} is
the name by which I am blasphemed. My name thou shalt not know, lest
thou pronounce it and pass by.

And now the Angel comes forward again and closes his mouth.

All this time heavy blows have been raining upon me from invisible
angels, so that I am weighed down as with a burden greater than the
world[**40**](#40). I am altogether crushed. Great millstones are hurled
out of heaven upon me[**41**](#41). I am trying to crawl to the
lion[**42**](#42), and the ground is covered with sharp knives. I cut
myself at every inch[**43**](#43).

And the voice comes: Why art thou there who art here[**44**](#44)? Hast
thou not the sign of the number[**45**](#45), and the seal of the
name[**46**](#46), and the ring of the eye[**47**](#47)? Thou wilt
not[**48**](#48).

And I answered and said: I am a creature of earth, and ye would have me
swim.

And the voice said: Thy fear is known; thine ignorance is known; thy
weakness is known; but thou art nothing in this matter. Shall the grain
which is cast into the earth by the hand of the sower debate within
itself, saying, am I oats or barley? Bondslave of the curse, we give
nothing, we take all. Be thou content. That which thou art, thou art. Be
content[**49**](#49).

And now the lion passeth over through the Aethyr with the crowned beast
upon his back, and the tail of the lion goes on instead of stopping, and
on each hair of the tail is something or other --- sometimes a little
house, sometimes a planet, at other times a town. Then there is a great
plain with soldiers fighting upon it, and an enormously high mountain
carved into a thousand temples, and more houses and fields and trees,
and great cities with wonderful buildings in them, statues and columns
and public buildings generally. This goes on and on and on and on and on
and on and on all on the hairs of this lion's tail[**50**](#50).

And then there is the tuft of his tail, which is like a comet, but the
head is a new universe, and each hair streaming away from it is a Milky
Way.

And then there is a pale stern figure, enormous, enormous, bigger than
all that universe is, in silver armour, with a sword and a pair of
balances[**51**](#51). That is only vague. All has gone into stone-gray,
blank.

There is nothing.

Ain el Hajel. November 25, 1909. 8:40-9:40 p.m.

(There were two voices in all this Cry, one behind the other --- or, one
was the speech, and the other the meaning. And the voice that was the
speech was simply a roaring, one tremendous noise, like a mixture of
thunder and water-falls and wild beasts and bands and artillery. And yet
it was articulate, though I cannot tell you what a single word was. But
the meaning of the voice --- the second voice --- was quite silent, and
put the ideas directly into the brain of the Seer, as if by touch. It is
not certain whether the millstones and the sword-strokes that rained
upon him were not these very sounds and ideas.)

1.  <span id="1"></span>VTI = {Capricorn}{Leo}{Sagittarius} = Caput
    Draconis, the head of the Lion-Serpent, the Beast 666. His father is
    {Capricorn} Set or Pan; his mother, the woman clothed with the Sun
    as in Atu XIV. See 27th Aethyr. He is the burden of the Moon,
    sanctified by 418. Atu XI (a partial form) with Atu XX (XI + XX
    = XXXI) gives the Key of the New Aeon.
2.  <span id="2"></span>The stone of Gemini, the twins, composing
    Heru-Ra-Ha, his Lord. Also the house of {Mercury}; that is, his form
    is Oracular.
3.  <span id="3"></span>The angel is an avatar of BABALON.
4.  <span
    id="4"></span>{GRK:alpha}{GRK:mu}{GRK:phi}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:rho}{GRK:eta}
    = 719. This Angel is a veil for 156, the Woman who closes the mouth
    of the lion in the old Atu XI, and is the Scarlet Woman who rides
    upon him in the new form.
5.  <span id="5"></span>The sorrow of Death.
6.  <span id="6"></span>This represents Jehovah and Jesus. The Pain of
    Toil. (Sin is Restriction).
7.  <span id="7"></span>Symbol of the Beast, 666.
8.  <span id="8"></span>See Atu XI. Babalon and the Beast conjoined.
9.  <span id="9"></span> BABALON prepared 666 (in a certain very secret
    manner) to utter the word
    {GRK:Theta}{GRK:epsilon}{GRK:lambda}{GRK:eta}{GRK:mu}{GRK:alpha}.
    (This may have some reference to Crowley´s first wife Rose who was
    the moving spirit in getting him prepared for invoking Thoth and
    Horus in the Spring 1904, and then for the writing of *The Book of
    the Law*.)
10. <span id="10"></span>666 is now inspired.
11. <span id="11"></span>Nostrils = {Mars} and {Venus}. Energy and
    passion, also Breath of the Word.
12. <span id="12"></span>Eye = Creative Light, i.e. of the Word.
13. <span id="13"></span>Scorpio.
14. <span id="14"></span>Netzach.
15. <span id="15"></span>Capricornus.
16. <span id="16"></span>Hod (the mercurial water): in all the Sephiroth
    below Tiphereth, out of balance, and the paths leading from them/
17. <span id="17"></span>Leo = {Leo} = {HEB:Tet} =
    {HEB:Taw}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Tet} = 419. t = {Leo}. {HEB:Tet} = snake by
    meaning. {Leo} = Horus.
18. <span id="18"></span>The magical image of the 1st Decan of Leo,
    rising at the birth of 666, is a lion-headed serpent.
19. <span id="19"></span>Horus, the Lord of 666.
20. <span id="20"></span>The Avatar of Binah, in the opening of this
    Aethyr.
21. <span id="21"></span>BABALON. See Atu XI.
22. <span id="22"></span>419-418=1. Or 667-666=1. 667 =
    {GRK:eta}{GRK:kappa} {GRK:omicron} {GRK:kappa}
    {GRK:kappa}{GRK:iota}{GRK:sigma}{GRK:eta}
    {GRK:gamma}{GRK:upsilon}{GRK:nu}{GRK:eta}, the Scarlet Woman. (WEH
    note: This is the correct Greek 667 entry from *Liber MCCLXIV*).
23. <span id="23"></span>419-418=1. Or 667-666=1. 667 =
    {GRK:eta}{GRK:kappa} {GRK:omicron} {GRK:kappa}
    {GRK:kappa}{GRK:iota}{GRK:sigma}{GRK:eta}
    {GRK:gamma}{GRK:upsilon}{GRK:nu}{GRK:eta}, the Scarlet Woman. (WEH
    note: This is the correct Greek 667 entry from *Liber MCCLXIV*)
24. <span id="24"></span>*Liber AL*, his weapon.
25. <span id="25"></span>This allusion must remain secret.
26. <span id="26"></span>This seal is that of BBABALON. The Seal of the
    A{.·.} A{.·.} See the *Book of Lies*,
    {GRK:Kappa}{GRK:epsilon}{GRK:phi}. {GRK:Mu}{GRK:theta} (Cap. 49).
27. <span id="27"></span>His motto as a Master of the Temple is this
    V.V.V.V.V. (Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici).
28. <span id="28"></span>V.V.V.V.V. Has 10 horns that spring from 5
    points.
29. <span id="29"></span>See the *Book of Lies*, Cap.
    {GRK:Mu}{GRK:theta}, 49. But there is One Eighth Head too Sacredly
    terrible to mention.
30. <span id="30"></span>Refers to Atu VII. {HEB:Chet} = The Chariot
    = 8. the Bearer of the Sangraal.
31. <span id="31"></span>The Mystery 5x = 6{square x} and 6x = 5{square
    x}, Heru-Ra-Ha is the Martial aspect of Sol.
32. <span id="32"></span>See AL, Cap. III, v. 74.
33. <span id="33"></span>Again a secret allusion. (WEH note: Join O.T.O.
    and attain to the mystery).
34. <span id="34"></span>The Seer was not yet a full initiate, and was
    hampered by A.C.
35. <span id="35"></span>This paragraph prophesies the purging of the
    worldly Fire in the Aeon of Horus. "Hell" is the pure Inmost Self of
    Man, that suffereth not extinction, but consumeth all the
    experiences of Life, coming thereby to know its own Perfection.
36. <span id="36"></span>32 teeth; hence the Name is
    {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod} {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} = 32.
    Macroprosophus interfused with Microprosophus.
37. <span id="37"></span>The tongue is the instrument of the Logos and
    so a Phallic or creative organ. Chokmah the logos, is the Root of
    Fire, and the Masculine Energy.
38. <span id="38"></span>These are the "Four Rivers of Eden". It is the
    fourfold understanding of the Logos. These reflect Him so perfectly
    that they reproduce His Form.
39. <span id="39"></span>{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Tzaddi}{HEB:Ayin}{HEB:Taw} = 600.
    A "great number" of Sol, normally 6. 600 = Kosmos. The blasphemy is
    in taking the material for the Spiritual Sun.
40. <span id="40"></span>"The Sin of the whole world". See the
    Mediterranean Manifesto.
41. <span id="41"></span>Prophetic of the pains, the initiation to 9x =
    2{square x}, undergone by 666 in order to become himself.
42. <span id="42"></span>Prophetic of the pains, the initiation to 9x =
    2{square x}, undergone by 666 in order to become himself.
43. <span id="43"></span>Prophetic of the pains, the initiation to 9x =
    2{square x}, undergone by 666 in order to become himself.
44. <span id="44"></span>i.e. "Why art Thou not consciously identical
    with 666?"
45. <span id="45"></span>The Qabalistic Proofs (of the truth of Aiwass)
    given by the virtues of 93.
46. <span id="46"></span>666.
47. <span id="47"></span>The ring of V.V.V.V.V., mentioned in LXV, v.
    16.
48. <span id="48"></span>My resistance to the Great Work.
49. <span id="49"></span>The Angel promises the Seer that he shall be
    666 in all truth, and counsels him to await His Hour in perfect
    confidence.
50. <span id="50"></span>Prophetic of the results of the Great Work
    delivered by 666.
51. <span id="51"></span>This refers to the Aeon which is to follow this
    of Horus. See *Liber AL*, Cap. III, v. 34. Its Lord is "the
    double-wanded one" "Thmaist --- Justice."
