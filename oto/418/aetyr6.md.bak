**The Cry of the 6th Aethyr,  
Which is Called MAZ**[**1**](#1.md)

There cometh into the stone the great Angel whose name is Av[**2**](#2.md),
and in him there are symbols which strive for mastery, --- Sulphur and
the Pentagram, and they are harmonized by the Swastika[**3**](#3.md). These
symbols are found both in the name of Av[**4**](#4.md) and in the name of
the Aethyr. Thus he is neither Horus nor Osiris. He is called the
radiance of Thoth; and this Aethyr is very hard to understand, for the
images form and dissolve more rapidly than lightning. These images are
the illusions made by the Ape of Thoth. And this I understand, that I am
not worthy to receive the mysteries of this Aethyr. And all this which I
have seen (being all the thoughts that I have ever thought) is, as it
were, a guardian of the Aethyr[**5**](#5.md).

I seem quite helpless. I am trying all sorts of magical methods of
piercing the veil: and the more I strive, the farther away I seem to get
from success. But a voice comes now: Must not understanding lie open
unto wisdom as the pyramids lie open to the stars?

Accordingly, I wait in a certain magical posture which it is not fitting
to disclose, and above me appears the starry heaven[**6**](#6.md) of night,
and one star greater than all the other stars. It is a star of eight
rays. I recognize it as the star in the seventeenth key of the Tarot, as
the Star of Mercury. And the light of it cometh from the path of Aleph.
And the letter Cheth is also involved in the interpretation of this
star, and the paths of he' and vau are the separations which this Star
unites[**7**](#7.md). And in the heart of the star is an exceeding
splendour, --- a god standing upon the moon, brilliant beyond
imagining[**8**](#8.md). It is like unto the vision of the Universal
Mercury. But this is the Fixed Mercury, and he' and vau are the
perfected sulphur and salt. But now I come into the centre of the maze,
and whirling dust of stars and great forgotten gods. It is the whirling
Svastika which throws off all these things, for the Svastika is in aleph
by the shape and number[**9**](#9.md), and in beth by the position of the
arms of the Magician[**10**](#10), and in gimel[**11**](#11.md) because of
the sign of the Mourning of Isis, and thus is the Crown defended by
these three thunderbolts. Is not thrice seventeen fifty-one, that is,
failure and pain?

Now I am shut out again by this black Svastika with a corona of fire
about it.

And a voice cries: Cursed be he that shall uncover the nakedness of the
Most High, for he is drunken upon the wine that is the blood of the
adepts. And BABALON hath lulled him to sleep upon her breast, and she
hath fled away, and left him naked, and she hath called her children
together, saying: Come up with me, and let us make a mock of the
nakedness of the Most High.

And the first of the adepts covered His shame with a cloth, walking
backwards; and was white. And the second of the adepts covered His shame
with a cloth, walking sideways and was yellow. And the third of the
adepts made a mock of His nakedness, walking forwards; and was black.
And these are three great schools of the Magi, who are also the three
Magi that journeyed unto Bethlehem; and because thou hast not wisdom,
thou shalt not know which school prevaileth, or if the three schools be
not one[**12**](#12.md). For the Black Brothers lift not up their heads
thus far into the Holy Chokmah, for they were all drowned in the great
flood, which is Binah, before the true vine could be planted upon the
holy hill of Zion.

Now again I stand in the centre, and all things whirl by with incessant
fury. And the thought of the god entereth my mind, and I cry aloud:
Behold, the volatile is become fixed; and in the heart of eternal motion
is eternal rest. So is the Peace beneath the sea that rageth with her
storms; so is the changeful moon, the dead planet that revolveth no
more. So the far-seeing, the far-darting hawk is poised passionless in
the blue; so also the ibis that is long of limb meditateth solitary in
the sign of Sulphur. Behold, I stand ever before the Eternal One in the
sign of the Enterer[**13**](#13.md). And by virtue of my speech is he
wrapped about in silence, and he is wrapped in mystery by me, who am the
Unveiler of the Mysteries. And although I be truth, yet do they call me
rightly the God of Lies, for speech is two-fold, and truth is
one[**14**](#14.md). Yet I stand at the centre of the spider's web, whereof
the golden filaments reach to infinity[**15**](#15.md).

But thou that art with me in the spirit-vision art not with me by right
of Attainment, and thou canst not stay in this place to behold how I run
and return, and who are the flies that are caught in my web. For I am
the inmost guardian that is immediately before the shrine.

None shall pass by me except he slay me[**16**](#16.md), and this is his
curse, that, having slain me, he must take my office and become the
maker of Illusions, the great deceiver, the setter of
snares[**17**](#17.md); he who baffleth even them that have understanding.
For I stand on every path, and turn them aside from the truth by my
words, and by my magick arts.

And this is the horror[**18**](#18.md) that was shown by the lake that was
nigh unto the City of the Seven Hills[**19**](#19.md), and this is the
Mystery of the great prophets that have come unto mankind. Moses, and
Buddha, and Lao Tan, and Krishna, and Jesus[**20**](#20.md), and Osiris,
and Mohammed; for all these attained unto the grade of Magus, and
therefore were they bound with the curse of Thoth. But, being guardians
of the truth, they have taught nothing but falsehood, except unto such
as understood; for the truth may not pass the Gate of the
Abyss[**21**](#21.md).

But the reflection of the truth hath been shown in the lower Sephiroth.
And its balance is in Beauty, and therefore have they who sought only
beauty come nearest to the truth. For the beauty receiveth directly
three rays from the supernals, and the others no more than
one[**22**](#22.md). So, therefore, they that have sought after majesty and
power and victory and learning and happiness and gold, have been
discomfited. And these sayings are the lights of wisdom that thou mayst
know thy Master, for he is a Magus. And because thou didst eat of the
Pomegranate in hell, for half the year art thou concealed, and half the
year revealed[**23**](#23.md).

Now I perceive the Temple that is the heart of this Aethyr[**24**](#24.md);
it is an Urn suspended in the air, without support, above the centre of
a well. And the well hath eight pillars, and a canopy above it, and
without there is a circle of marble paving-stones, and without them a
great outer circle of pillars. And beyond there is the forest of the
stars. But the Urn is the wonderful thing in all this; it is made of
fixed Mercury; and within it are the ashes of the Book
Tarot[**25**](#25), which hath been utterly consumed[**26**](#26.md).

And this is that mystery which is spoken of in the Acts of the Apostles;
that Jupiter and Mercury (Kether and Chokmah) visited (that is,
inspired), Ephesus, the City of Diana[**27**](#27.md), Binah --- was not
Diana a black stone? -- and they burnt their books of magick.

Now it seems that the centre of infinite space is that Urn, and Hadit is
the fire that hath burnt up the book Tarot. For in the book Tarot was
preserved all of the wisdom (for the Tarot was called the Book of
Thoth), of the Aeon that is passed. And in the Book of Enoch was first
given the wisdom of the New Aeon. And it was hidden for three hundred
years, because it was wrested untimely from the Tree of Life by the hand
of a desperate magician[**28**](#28). For it was the Master[**29**](#29.md)
of that Magician who overthrew the power of the Christian church; but
the pupil rebelled against the master, for he foresaw that the New
(i.e., the Protestant) would be worse than the Old. But he understood
not the purpose of his Master, and that was, to prepare the way for the
overthrowing of the Aeon[**30**](#30.md).

There is a writing upon the Urn of which I can but read the (two) words:
Stabat Crux juxta Lucem. Stabat Lux juxta Crucem.

And there is writing in Greek above that. The word "nox" written in
Greek, and a circle with a cross in the centre of it, a St. Andrew's
cross[**31**](#31.md).

Then above that is a sigil(?), hidden by a hand[**32**](#32.md).

And a voice proceedeth from the Urn: From the ashes of the Tarot who
shall make the phoenix-wand? Not even he who by his understanding hath
made the lotus-wand to grow in the Great Sea. Get thee back, for thou
art not an Atheist, and though thou have violated thy mother, thou hast
not slain thy father[**33**](#33.md). Get thee back from the Urn; thy ashes
are not hidden here[**34**](#34.md).

Then again arose the God Thoth, in the sign of the Enterer, and he drove
the seer from before his face. And he fell through the starry night unto
the little village in the desert.

3.  <span id="3"></span>{Sulphur} is the active Fiery Nature, and the
    the Microcosm of the Elements. But Atu IV, The Emperor, refers to
    {HEB:Heh} = 5, and he forms {Sulphur}, the sign for Sulphur, by the
    position of his arms and legs. Then harmonizes these, being the
    fiery thunderbolt, the electric whirling; and also the balance of
    the elements (its 4 arms) in a Microcosm.
4.  <span id="4"></span>A = {HEB:Aleph} the Swastika; V = {HEB:Vau} =

    {HEB:Vau} and {HEB:Heh} lead from Chesed and Tiphareth to Chokmah.
7.  <span id="7"></span>Atu XVII has the letter {HEB:Heh} in the new
    Thelemic attribution. The Star is {Mercury} (Chokmah), for He is the
    light of Binah, the naked woman of the Atu. (Her arms make the
    Swastika; it is the sign of the Mourning of Isis. Aleph is the Path
    through which the light of Kether comes to Chokmah. Cheth is said in
    the Zohar to interpret H; and Cheth is the Path which conveys the
    Cup of Binah to the Inferiors. {Mercury} Unites H and Vau, for they
    are {Sulphur} and {Salt} (V = the Kerub of {Spirit}).

12. <span id="12"></span>4. This doctrine of the Three Schools is of
    extreme interest. Roughly, it may be said that the White is the Pure
    Mystic, whose attitude to God is one of reverence. The Yellow School
    conceals the Mysteries indeed, but examines them as it goes. The
    Black School is that of pure Skepticism.

19. <span id="19"></span>The Lake of Nemi. See J. G. Frazer, *The Golden
    Bough*.
20. <span id="20"></span>This name is cunningly slipped in by the Art of
    the God, for "Jesus" is but the figure-head used by the priests for
    their "Great Sorcery".
21. <span id="21"></span>See again *Liber Magi* for this disheartening
    doctrine.
22. <span id="22"></span>See the Tree of Life.
23. <span id="23"></span>It has been curiously true, that the Seer since
    this time has usually been concealed in A Great Magical Retirement
    for about half of every year. This doctrine of the eating of the
    pomegranate refers to the fact that he refused to adopt one of the
    routine methods of success in Magick. He, being the Beast, 666, felt
    that he must keep his hold on Tiphereth by maintaining the Formula
    of the Rosy Cross.
24. <span id="24"></span>This is like the Temple of Vesta at Rome in
    some way.
25. <span id="25"></span>This perhaps is also the karma of the new
    Magus. Somewhere it says that a white ash is prepared from the dust
    of NEMO by Hermes, the Invisible. For Urn see Azbogah {Mercury} =
    {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Koph} = a pot, 24. But it may be 86 = {HEB:Samekh}
    {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Koph} q.v.
26. <span id="26"></span>The Master of the Temple who is chosen to
    proceed to the Grade of Magus has his little Pyramid of Dust
    consumed to ashes, and these are preserved in this Urn.
27. <span id="27"></span>Vesta = {Virgo}.
28. <span id="28"></span>Sir Edward Kelly. The reference is to the
    famous passage which Dee maintained to be given by demons. It taught
    that there was no sin, etc.
29. <span id="29"></span>Martin Luther.
30. <span id="30"></span>Martin Luther's magical act of cohabitation
    with a nun was the key to this doctrine.
31. <span id="31"></span>= {GRK:Nu}{GRK:Omicron}{GRK:Chi} = N.O.X.
32. <span id="32"></span>All this required a Magus to see properly.
33. <span id="33"></span>This again means that the Magus 9x = 2{square
    x} must burn up all his karma.
34. <span id="34"></span>This fact is now maintained openly. As to
    Atheists see *Liber LXV*, V. 34 - 40. Also 5th Aire; the Magister
    Templi is already being subtly prepared to attain to be a Magus.
