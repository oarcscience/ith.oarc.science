# **The Cry of the 28th Aethyr, Which is Called BAG**[**1**](#1.md)

There cometh an Angel into the stone with opalescent[**2**](#2.md) shining
garments like a wheel[**3**](#3.md) of fire on every side of him, and in
his hand is a long flail of scarlet lightning[**4**](#4.md); his face is
black[**5**](#5.md), and his eyes white without any pupil or
iris[**6**](#6.md). The face is very terrible indeed to look upon. Now in
front of him is a wheel[**7**](#7.md), with many spokes, and many tyres; it
is like a fence[**8**](#8.md) in front of him.

And he cries: O man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the
Mystery[**9**](#9)? for it is hidden unto the End of Time[**10**](#10.md).

And I answer him: Time[**11**](#11.md) is not, save in the darkness of Her
womb by whom evil came.

And now the wheel breaks away, and I see him as he is. His garment is
black beneath the opal veils, but it is lined with white, and he has the
shining belly of a fish, and enormous wings of black and white feathers,
and innumerable little legs and claws like a centipede, and a long tail
like a scorpion. The breasts are human, but they are all scored with
blood; and he cries: O thou who hast broken down the veil, knowest thou
not that who cometh where I am must be scarred by many
sorrows[**12**](#12.md)?

And I answer him: Sorrow[**13**](#13.md) is not, save in the darkness of
the womb of Her by whom came evil.

I pierce the Mystery[**13**](#13) of his breast[**13**](#13.md), and
therein is a jewel[**13**](#13.md). It is a sapphire as great as an ostrich
egg{[**13**](#13.md)SUP:2}, and thereon is graven this sigil:

\[Figure: This is in the form of two "U" shapes, very elongated in the
risers. The one to the right is lower than the first, and its left riser
extends 2/3's of the way up inside the center of the one to the left.
The left "U" turns back down to the far left, ending 1/5th the way down
in a tiny circle. The right bends abruptly horizontally left across the
other and also ends there in a tiny circle.\]

But there is also much writing on the stone, very minute characters
carved. I cannot read them. He points with his flail to the sapphire,
which is now outside him and bigger than himself[**14**](#14.md); and he
cries: Hail! warden of the Gates of Eternity who knowest
not[**15**](#15) thy right hand from thy left[**16**](#16.md); for in the
aeon of my Father is a god with clasped hands wherein he holdeth the
universe, crushing[**17**](#17.md) it into the dust that ye call stars.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right eye[**16**](#16.md) from thy left;
for in the aeon of my Father there is but one light.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right nostril[**16**](#16.md) from thy
left; for in the aeon of my Father there is neither life nor death.

Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right ear[**16**](#16.md) from thy left;
for in the aeon of my Father there is neither sound nor silence.

Whoso hath power to break open this sapphire stone shall find therein
four elephants having tusks of mother-of-pearl, and upon whose backs are
castles, those castles which ye call the watch-towers of the
Universe[**18**](#18.md).

Let me dwell in peace within the breast of the Angel that is warden of
the aethyr. Let not the shame of my Mother be unveiled. Let not her be
put to shame that lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars.

O man, that must ever be opening, when wilt thou learn to seal up the
mysteries of the creation? to fold thyself over thyself as a rose in the
embrace of night? But thou must play the wanton to the sun, and the wind
must tear thy petals from thee, and the bee must rob thee of thy honey,
and thou must fall into the dusk of things. Amen and Amen.

Verily the light is hidden, therefore he who hideth himself is like unto
the light; but thou openest thyself; thou art like unto the darkness
that bindeth the belly of the great goddess[**19**](#19.md).

OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA
GAHAL GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX[**20**](#20.md).

And the voice of the aeon cried: Return, return, return! the time
sickeneth, and the space gapeth, and the voice of him that is, was and
shall be crowned rattles in the throat of the mighty dragon of
eld[**21**](#21.md). Thou canst not pass by me, except thou have the
mystery of the word of the abyss.

Now the angel putteth back the sapphire stone into his breast; and I
spake unto him and said, I will fight with thee and overcome thee,
except thou expound unto me the word of the abyss.

Now he makes as if to fight with me. (It is very horrible, all the
tentacles moving and the flail flashing, and the fierce eyeless face,
strained and swollen.) And with the Magic sword I pierce through his
armour to his breast. He fell back, saying: Each of these my scars was
thus made, for I am the warden of the aethyr. And he would have said
more; but I cut him short, saying: expound the word of the Abyss. And he
said[**22**](#22.md): Discipline is sorrowful and ploughing is laborious
and age is weariness.

Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion[**23**](#23.md).

But now, if the sun arise[**24**](#24.md){SUP:1}, fold thou thine
arms[**24**](#24.md); then shall God smite thee into a pillar of
salt[**25**](#25.md).

Look not so deeply into words and letters; for this Mystery hath been
hidden by the Alchemists. Compose the sevenfold into a fourfold
regimen[**26**](#26.md); and when thou hast understood thou mayest make
symbols[**27**](#27.md); but by playing child's games with symbols thou
shalt never understand[**28**](#28.md). Thou hast the signs; thou hast the
words; but there are many things that are not in my power, who am but
the warden of the 28th Aethyr.

Now my name thou shalt obtain in this wise. Of the three angels of the
Aethyr, thou shalt write the names from right to left and from left to
right and from right to left, and these are the holy letters:

The first 1, the fifth 2, the sixth 3, the eleventh 4, the seventh 5,
the twelfth 6, the seventeenth 7.

Thus hast thou my name[**29**](#29.md) who am above these three, but the
angels of the 30th Aethyr are indeed four, and they have none above
them; wherefore dispersion and disorder[**30**](#30.md).

Now cometh from every side at once a voice, terribly great, crying:
Close the veil; the great blasphemy hath been uttered; the face of my
Mother[**31**](#31.md) is scarred by the nails of the devil. Shut the book,
destroy the breaker of the seal!

And I answered: Had he not been destroyed he had not come hither, for I
am not save in the darkness in the womb of Her[**32**](#32.md) by whom came
evil into the world.

And this darkness swallows everything up[**33**](#33.md), and the angel is
-------------------- gone from the stone[**34**](#34.md); and there is no
light therein, save only the light of the Rose and of the
Cross[**35**](#35.md).

Aumale, Algeria. November 23, 1909, between 8 and 9 p.m.

14. <span id="14"></span>Binah absorbs all.
15. <span id="15"></span>Binah destroys knowledge.
16. <span id="16"></span>Hands: {Mercury}: for Hand is Iod, Virgo. Also
    the two hands are the Twin Serpents. Eyes {Sun} & {Moon} The
    Positive and Negative. Executive currents of the Logos. Nostrils

    system, cannot be used in this phrase; for the Ears {Jupiter} &
    {Saturn} Mouth is One, not Two, being the Logos itself. And the
    Lodgos is essentially an Unity, although manifested through
    Vibration. It is therefore not destroyed with the other objects of
    Knowledge, though its dual modes of expression, the hands, are no
    longer known apart.
17. <span id="17"></span>See *Liber AL*, III, v. 72.
18. <span id="18">The Elements are hidden in Binah.</span>
19. <span id="19">In the light of the cry ofLOE, this passage seems to
    mean precisely the opposite of its apparent meaning. The whole cry,
    from "Let me dwell ..." is an Invocation of Binah. It is a
    foreshadowing of the Mysteries of the Crossing of the Abyss.</span>
20. <span id="20">The translation of this is in my private copy (white
    and gold binding). Possibly also in the Cefalu set which was copied
    from that (?) by Estai. (?).</span>

25. <span id="25">Prophetic of the 8x = 3{square x} attainment; the
    pillar is phallic, and salt is {Salt}, of Binah, the Great Sea. Cf.

27. <span id="27">The 8x = 3{square x} may devise a new Qabalah.  
    </span>
28. <span id="28">One cannot become 8x = 3{square x} by intellectual

    {HEB:Nun}{HEB:Ta w}="Draco" Magnus, the Mighty Dragon. This is the
    symbol of Nuit or Binah. The whole symbolism of this Angel is
    therefore exactly confirmed through a Qabalistic equation of which
    the Seer had no idea at the time. N.B. He is above the dispersion
    and disorder just as Binah is above the Abyss of Choronzon.
30. <span id="30">The four elements unharmonized break up into
    Choronzon.</span>

32. <span id="32">Binah.</span>
33. <span id="33">Typical gesture of Binah.</span>
34. <span id="34">The general attribution of this Aethyr is to
    Atu XVII.</span>
35. <span id="35">Binah being gone, the seer descends to his normal
    place in Tiphereth.</span>
