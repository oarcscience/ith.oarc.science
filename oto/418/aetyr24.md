**The Cry of the 24th Aethyr,  
Which is Called NIA**[**1**](#1)

An angel comes forward into the stone like a warrior clad in chain-
armour. Upon his head are plumes of gray[**2**](#2), spread out like the
fan of a peacock[**3**](#3). About his feet a great army of scorpions
and dogs, lions, elephants, and many other wild beasts. He stretches
forth his arms to heaven and cries; In the crackling of the lightning,
in the rolling of the thunder, in the clashing of the swords and the
hurling of the arrows[**4**](#4): be thy name exalted!

Streams of fire come out of the heavens, a pale brilliant
blue[**5**](#5), like plumes. And they gather themselves and settle upon
his lips. His lips are redder than roses, and the blue plumes gather
themselves into a blue rose[**6**](#6), and from beneath the petals of
the rose come brightly coloured humming-birds[**7**](#7), and dew falls
from the rose- honey-coloured dew[**8**](#8). I stand in the shower of
it.

And a voice proceeds from the rose: Come away! Our chariot is drawn by
doves[**9**](#9). Of mother-of-pearl and ivory is our
chariot[**10**](#10) and the reins thereof are the heart-strings of men.
Every moment that we fly shall cover an aeon. And every place on which
we rest shall be a young universe rejoicing in its strength; the meadows
thereof shall be covered with flowers. There shall we rest but a night,
and in the morning we shall flee away, comforted.

Now, to myself, I have imagined the chariot of which the voice spake,
and I looked to see who was with me in the chariot. It was an Angel of
golden hair and golden skin, whose eyes were bluer than the sea, whose
mouth was redder than the fire, whose breath was ambrosial air. Finer
than a spider's web were her robes. And they were of the seven
colours[**11**](#11).

All this I saw; and then the hidden voice went on low and sweet: Come
away! The price of the journey is little, though its name be death. Thou
shalt die to all that thou fearest and hopest and hatest and lovest and
thinkest and art. Yea! thou shalt die, even as thou must die. For all
that thou hast, thou hast not; all that thou art, thou art
not[**12**](#12)!

NENNI OFEKUFA ANANAEL LAIADA I MAELPEREJI NONUKA AFAFA ADAREPEHETA
PEREGI ALADI NIISA NIISA LAPE OL ZODIR IDOIAN[**13**](#13).

And I said: ODO KIKALE QAA. Why art thou hidden from me, whom I hear?

And the voice answered and said unto me: Hearing is of the spirit
alone[**14**](#14). Thou art a partaker of the five-fold
mystery[**15**](#15). Thou must roll up the ten divine ones like a
scroll, and fashion therefrom a star[**16**](#16). Yet must thou blot
out the star in the heart of Hadit[**17**](#17).

For the blood of my heart is like a warm bath of myrrh and ambergris;
bathe thyself therein. The blood of my heart is all gathered upon my
lips if I kiss thee, burns in my fingertips if I caress thee, burns in
my womb when thou art caught up into my bed. Mighty are the stars;
mighty is the sun; mighty is the moon; mighty is the voice of the
ever-living one, and the echoes of his whisper are the thunders of the
dissolution of the worlds. But my silence is mightier than they. Close
up the worlds like unto a weary house; close up the book of the
recorder, and let the veil swallow up the shrine, for I am arisen, O my
fair one, and there is no more need of all these things.

If once I put thee apart from me, it was the joy of play. Is not the ebb
and flowing of the tide a music of the sea? Come, let us mount unto Nuit
our mother and be lost! Let being be emptied in the infinite abyss! For
by me only shalt thou mount; thou hast none other wings than
mine[**18**](#18).

All this while the Rose has been shooting out blue flames, coruscating
like snakes through the whole Aire. And the snakes have taken shapes of
sentences. One of them is: *Sub umbra alarum tuarum Adonai quies et
felicitas*[**19**](#19). And another: *Summum bonum, vera sapientia,
magnanima vita, sub noctis nocte sunt*[**20**](#20). And another is:
*Vera medicina est vinum mortis*[**21**](#21). And another is: *Libertas
evangelii per jugum legis ob gloriam dei intactam ad vacuum nequaquam
tendit*[**22**](#22). And another is: *Sub aqu lex
terrarum*[**23**](#23). And another is: *Mens edax rerum, cor umbra
rerum; intelligentia via summa*[**24**](#24). And another is: *Summa via
lucis: per Hephaestum* *undas regas*[**25**](#25). And another is: *Vir
introit tumulum regis, invenit oleum lucis*[**26**](#26).

And all round the whole of these things are the letters TARO; but the
light is so dreadful that I cannot read the words. I am going to try
again. All these serpents are collected together very thickly at the
edges of the wheel, because there are an innumerable number of
sentences. One is: *tres annos regimen oraculi*[**27**](#27). And
another is: *terribilis ardet rex*
{HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Ayin}[**28**](#28). And
another is: *Ter amb* (amp?) (can't see it) *Rosam oleo*
(?)[**29**](#29). And another is: Tribus annulis regna
olisbon[**30**](#30). And the marvel is that with those four letters you
can get a complete set of rules for doing everything, both for white
magic and black.

And now I see the heart of the rose again. I see the face of him that is
the heart of the rose, and in the glory of that face I am ended. My eyes
are fixed upon his eyes; my being is sucked up through my eyes into
those eyes. And I see through those eyes, and lo! the universe, like
whirling sparks of gold, blown like a tempest. I seem to swell out again
into him. My consciousness fills the whole Aethyr. I hear the cry NIA,
ringing again and again from within me. It sounds like infinite music,
and behind the sound is the meaning of the Aethyr. Again there are no
words.

All this time the whirling sparks of gold go on, and they are like blue
sky, with a lot of rather thin white clouds in it, outside. And now I
see mountains round, far blue mountains, purple mountains. And in the
midst is a little green dell of moss, which is all sparkling with dew
that drips from the rose. And I am lying on that moss with my face
upwards, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking, drinking of the dew.

I cannot describe to you the joy and the exhaustion of everything that
was, and the energy of everything that is, for it is only a corpse that
is lying on the moss. I am the soul of the Aethyr[**31**](#31).

Now it reverberates like the swords of archangels, clashing upon the
armour of the damned; and there seem to be the blacksmiths of heaven
beating the steel of the worlds upon the anvils of hell, to make a roof
to the Aethyr[**32**](#32).

For if the great work were accomplished and all the Aethyrs were caught
up into one, then would the vision fail; then would the voice be still.

Now all is gone from the stone.

Ain el Hajel. November 26, 1909. 2-3:25 p.m.

1.  <span id="1"></span>NIA = {Scorpio}{Sagittarius}{Taurus} = 116. She
    is Atu XIV --- "The Woman clothed with the Sun", see 27th Aire,
    between {Scorpio}, Love as the instrument of change by Putrefaction,
    and {Taurus}, the heavenly Isis. But cf. also AL III, v. 72 -- Coph
    Nia. This completes the Mystery of Atu XI by the Vision of 156, also
    in a partial form. The Beast and the Scarlet Woman at attributed to
    {Leo} and Water {Scorpio}. They are the two-in-one Chief Officers,
    of the Temple of the New Aeon of Heru-Ra-Ha. (Note: The Eagle Kerub
    in the 23rd Aire is Aquarius {Aquarius}. Scorpio is the
    Woman-Serpent. This is important; for the old attribution is of the
    Eagle to {Scorpio})
2.  <span id="2"></span>The Ajna-Chakra --- Chokmah.
3.  <span id="3"></span>Sacred to Juno.
4.  <span id="4"></span>Arrows of {Sagittarius} the rainbow which
    follows this storm.
5.  <span id="5"></span>Blue of Sagittarius (Atu XIV).
6.  <span id="6"></span>Woman in {Sagittarius}.
7.  <span id="7"></span>Sacred to Venus.
8.  <span id="8"></span>Distilled from Cauldron in Atu XIV. The Elixir.
    In this Aire is a Mystery of the IX° of the O.T.O.
9.  <span id="9"></span>Sacred to {Venus}. This woman combines {Jupiter}
    (Juno) and {Venus}; but she is more than all this, the Quintessence
    of Scorpio, the Lady of the Cup.
10. <span id="10"></span>Chariot = Atu VII = {Cancer} cardinal sign of
    {Water}. Mother of Pearl is sacred to {Water}; cups symbolize
    Pleasure, especially sexual pleasure. Ivory comes from the tusks of
    the Elephant: teeth pertain to {HEB:Shin}, the fire of the Spirit.
    Ivory is thus a symbol of the hard gleaming militant delight of
    sexual energy, which bears Love in her Chariot through Heaven.
11. <span id="11"></span>All typical of {Venus}.
12. <span id="12"></span>Prophetic of the 8x = 3{square x} Initiation.
    Love is the motive power which makes the Adeptus Exemptus take the
    plunge into the Abyss.
13. <span id="13"></span>Enochian.
14. <span id="14"></span>The traditional attribution.
15. <span id="15"></span>i.e. of the Pentagram.
16. <span id="16"></span>The ten Sephiroth form the Flaming Sword. The
    idea is to make a perfect Man. (the Pentagram) by folding up his 10
    consecutive qualities into a single symmetrical symbol.
17. <span id="17"></span>This star must itself be blotted out in the
    Point-of View, the Quintessence of Individuality.
18. <span id="18"></span>The totality of experiences has amounted to
    Perfection. There is then no more need of a manifested Universe. See
    AL. I, v. 29, for the Object of Division.
19. <span id="19"></span>Refers to 5x = 6{square x} initiation.
20. <span id="20"></span>Refers to the Night of Pan (see later Aires)
    and so to 8x = 3{square x} which with 5x = 6{square x} make the two
    initiated steps.
21. <span id="21"></span>Cf. the general doctrine about Death. AL II,
    vs. 72-74, et al.
22. <span id="22"></span>Combines the four sentences in this order
    {Aquarius}{Taurus}{Leo} {Scorpio} on the circular altar in the vault
    of Christian Rosencreutz. The meaning is: Liberty, Law, Light fill
    the Universe.
23. <span id="23"></span>S.A.L.T.
24. <span id="24"></span>M.E.R.C.U.R.I.U.S. Meaning: the mind destroys
    the external (by abstracting its reality: see any good Yoga
    treatise). The heart is their shadow (i.e. Reality only appears as
    impressions). Binah (8x = 3{square x}) is the Highest Way.
25. <span id="25"></span>S.U.L.P.H.U.R. An alchemical injunction; a
    reference to AL, Cap. 2, v. 57.
26. <span id="26"></span>V.I.T.R.I.O.L. Reference to IXx O.T.O.
27. <span id="27"></span>Refers to time required to assimilate the
    Initiation of 8x=3{squarex} For three years is 156 weeks; and 156 =
    BABALON.
28. <span id="28"></span>Elyon: the exalted one, nVLI (?). 156, a name
    of BABALON, (see the Urn) with with the Phallic Yod in the midst.
29. <span id="29"></span>Meaning: the Rose must be thrice anointed (?)
    with oil. (That is, with the oil.)
30. <span id="30"></span>Refers to the Tree of Life; to be ruled by the
    three reciprocating Paths, {HEB:Dalet}, {HEB:Tet}, {HEB:Peh}; that
    is, by the supernal love, by the Formula of Babalon and the Beast
    conjoined, and by that Formula at which is hinted in Liber AL.
    1,2,3,4. all T.A.R.O.
31. <span id="31"></span>This passage describes an Initiation, the first
    of this series. It is the exhaustion of the lower Self of the Seer
    in his first union with BABALON.
32. <span id="32"></span>This roof seems to be the Path of {HEB:Peh}
    (Mars, blacksmiths, steel, etc., the first ring that binds the
    {GRK:omicron}{GRK:lambda}{GRK:iota}
    {GRK:omicron}{GRK:beta}{GRK:omicron}{GRK : sigma}). The union with
    his Mate first occurs In Yesod, of which {HEB:Peh} may be called the
    roof. Later we shall find the other marriages of {HEB:Tet} and
    {HEB:Dalet}.
