        Which is Called LOE</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font
        size="6"> </font></p>
      <p>There appear in the stone two pillars of flame, and in the midst is a 
        chariot of white fire. </p>
      <p>This seems to be the chariot of the Seventh Key of Tarot. But it is drawn 
        by four sphinxes, diverse, like the four sphinxes upon the door of the 
        vault of the adepts, counterchanged in their component parts. </p>
      <p>The chariot itself is the lunar crescent, waning. The canopy is supported 
        by eight pillars of amber. These pillars are upright, and yet the canopy 
        which they support is the whole vault of the night. </p>
      <p>The charioteer is a man in golden armour, studded with sapphires, but 
        over his shoulders is a white robe, and over that a red robe. Upon his 
        golden helmet he beareth for his crest a crab. His hands are clasped upon 
        a cup<a
        href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>, from which radiates 
        a ruddy glow, constantly increasing, so that everything is blotted out 
        by its glory, and the whole Aire is filled with it. </p>
      <p>And there is a marvelous perfume in the Aire, like unto the perfume of 
        Ra Hoor Khuit, but sublimated, as if the quintessence of that perfume 
        alone were burnt. For it hath the richness and voluptuousness and humanity 
        of blood, and the strength and freshness of meal, and the sweetness of 
        honey, and the purity of olive-oil, and the holiness of that oil which 
        is made of myrrh, and cinnamon, and galangal<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>The charioteer speaks in a low, solemn voice, awe-inspiring, like a large 
        and very distant bell: Let him look upon the cup whose blood is mingled 
        therein, for the wine of the cup is the blood of the saints. Glory unto 
        the Scarlet Woman, Babalon the Mother of Abominations, that rideth upon 
        the Beast<a href="#4"><font
        size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>, for she hath spilt their blood 
        in every corner of the earth and lo! she hath mingled it in the cup of 
        her whoredom. </p>
      <p>With the breath of her kisses hath she fermented it, and it hath become 
        the wine of the Sacrament, the wine of the Sabbath; and in the Holy Assembly 
        hath she poured it out for her worshippers, and they had become drunken 
        thereon, so that face to face they beheld my Father. Thus are they made 
        worthy to become partakers of the Mystery of this holy vessel, for the 
        blood is the life. So sitteth she from age to age, and the righteous are 
        never weary of her kisses, and by her murders and fornications she seduceth 
        the world. Therein is manifested the glory of my Father, who is truth. 
      </p>
      <p>(This wine is such that its virtue radiateth through the cup, and I reel 
        under the intoxication of it. And every thought is destroyed by it. It 
        abideth alone, and its name is Compassion. I understand by &quot;Compassion,&quot; 
        the sacrament of suffering, partaken by the true worshippers of the Highest. 
        And it is an ecstasy in which there is no trace of pain. Its passivity 
        (=passion) is like the giving-up of the self to the beloved.) </p>
      <p>The voice continues: This is the Mystery of Babylon, the Mother of abominations, 
        and this is the mystery of her adulteries, for she hath yielded up herself 
        to everything that liveth, and hath become a partaker in its mystery. 
        And because she hath made herself the servant of each, therefore is she 
        become the mistress of all. Not as yet canst thou comprehend her glory. 
      </p>
      <p>Beautiful art thou, O Babylon, and desirable, for thou hast given thyself 
        to everything that liveth, and thy weakness hath subdued their strength<a href="#5"><font
        size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. For in that union thou didst <em>understand</em>. 
        Therefore art thou called Understanding, O Babylon, Lady of the Night! 
      </p>
      <p>This is that which is written, &quot;O my God, in one last rapture let 
        me attain to the union with the many.<a
        href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>&quot; For she is 
        Love, and her love is one, and she hath divided the one love into infinite 
        loves, and each love is one, and equal to The One, and therefore is she 
        passed &quot;from the assembly and the law and the enlightenment unto 
        the anarchy of solitude and darkness. For ever thus must she veil the 
        brilliance of Her Self.<a href="#7"><font
        size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>&quot; O Babylon, Babylon, thou 
        mighty Mother, that ridest upon the crown d beast, let me be drunken upon 
        the wine of thy fornications; let thy kisses wanton me unto death, that 
        even I, thy cup-bearer, may <em>understand</em>. </p>
      <p>Now, through the ruddy glow of the cup, I may perceive far above, and 
        infinitely great, the vision of Babylon. And the Beast whereon she rideth 
        is the Lord of the City of the Pyramids, that I beheld in the fourteenth 
        Aethyr. </p>
      <p>Now that is gone in the glow of the cup, and the Angel saith: Not as 
        yet mayest thou understand the mystery of the Beast, for it pertaineth 
        not unto the mystery of this Aire, and few that are new-born unto Understanding 
        are capable thereof<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>The cup glows ever brighter and fierier. All my sense is unsteady, being 
        smitten with ecstasy. </p>
      <p>And the Angel sayeth: Blessed are the saints, that their blood is mingled 
        in the cup, and can never be separate any more. For Babylon the Beautiful, 
        the Mother of abominations, hath sworn by her holy cteis, whereof every 
        point is a pang, that she will not rest from her adulteries until the 
        blood of everything that liveth is gathered therein, and the wine thereof 
        laid up and matured and consecrated, and worthy to gladden the heart of 
        my Father. For my Father is weary with the stress of eld, and cometh not 
        to her bed. Yet shall this perfect wine be the quintessence, and the elixir, 
        and by the draught thereof shall he renew his youth; and so shall it be 
        eternally, as age by age the worlds do dissolve and change, and the universe 
        unfoldeth itself as a Rose, and shutteth itself up as the Cross that is 
        bent into the cube. </p>
      <p>And this is the comedy of Pan, that is played at night in the thick forest. 
        And this is the mystery of Dionysus Zagreus, that is celebrated upon the 
        holy mountain of Kithairon. And this is the secret of the brothers of 
        the Rosy Cross; and this is the heart of the ritual that is accomplished 
        in the Vault of the Adepts that is hidden in the Mountain of the Caverns, 
        even the Holy Mountain Abiegnus<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>And this is the meaning of the Supper of the Passover, the spilling of 
        the blood of the Lamb being a ritual of the Dark Brothers, for they have 
        sealed up the Pylon with blood, lest the Angel of Death should enter therein. 
        Thus do they shut themselves off from the company of the saints. Thus 
        do they keep themselves from compassion and from understanding. Accurs 
        d are they, for they shut up their blood in their heart<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>They keep themselves from the kisses of my Mother Babylon, and in their 
        lonely fortresses they pray to the false moon. And they bind themselves 
        together with an oath, and with a great curse. And of their malice they 
        conspire together, and they have power, and mastery, and in their cauldrons 
        do they brew the harsh wine of delusion, mingled with the poison of their 
        selfishness. </p>
      <p>Thus they make war upon the Holy One, sending forth their delusion upon 
        men, and upon everything that liveth. So that their false compassion is 
        called compassion, and their false understanding is called understanding, 
        for this is their most potent spell. </p>
      <p>Yet of their own poison do they perish, and in their lonely fortresses 
        shall they be eaten up by Time that hath cheated them to serve him, and 
        by the mighty devil Choronzon, their master, whose name is the Second 
        Death<a
        href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>, for the blood 
        that they have sprinkled on their Pylon, that is a bar against the Angel 
        Death, is the key by which he entereth in<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
      </p>
      <p>The Angel sayeth: And this is the word of double power in the voice of 
        the Master, wherein the Five interpenetrateth the Six<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
        This is its secret interpretation that may not be understood, save only 
        of <em>them that understand</em>. And for this is the Key of the Pylon 
        of Power, because there is no power that may endure, save only the power 
        that descendeth in this my chariot from Babylon, the city of Fifty Gates, 
        the Gate of the God On [{HEB:Nun- final} {HEB:Ayin} {HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Aleph} 
        {HEB:Bet}{HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Bet}]<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a> 
        . Moreover is On the Key of the Vault that is 120. So also do the Majesty 
        and the Beauty derive from the Supernal Wisdom. </p>
      <p>But this is a mystery utterly beyond thine understanding. For Wisdom 
        is the Man, and Understanding the Woman, and not until thou hast perfectly 
        understood canst thou begin to be wise. But I reveal unto thee a mystery 
        of the Aethyrs, that not only are they bound up with the Sephiroth, but 
        also with the Paths. Now, the plane of the Aethyrs interpenetrateth and 
        surroundeth the universe wherein the Sephiroth are established, and therefore 
        is the order of the Aethyrs not the order of the Tree of Life. And only 
        in a few places do they coincide. But the knowledge of the Aethyrs is 
        deeper than the knowledge of the Sephiroth, for that in the Aethyrs is 
        the knowledge of the Aeons, and of {GRK:Theta}{GRK:epsilon} {GRK:lambda} 
        {GRK:eta} {GRK:mu} {GRK:alpha}. And to each shall it be given according 
        to his capacity. (He has been saying certain secret things to the unconscious 
        mind of the seer, of a personal nature.) </p>
      <p>Now a voice comes from without: And lo! I saw you to the end. </p>
      <p>And a great bell begins to toll. And there come six little children out 
        of the floor of the chariot, and in their hands is a veil so fine and 
        transparent that it is hardly visible. Yet, when they put it over the 
        Cup, the Angel bowing his head reverently, the light of the Cup goes out 
        entirely. And as the light of the Cup vanishes, it is like a swift sunset 
        in the whole Aire, for it was from the light of that Cup alone that it 
        was lighted. </p>
      <p>And now the light is all gone out of the stone, and I am very cold. </p>
