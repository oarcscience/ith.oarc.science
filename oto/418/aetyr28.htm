<h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 28th Aethyr, <br>
  Which is Called BAG</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a> 
</h1>
<p>There cometh an Angel into the stone with opalescent<a
        href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a> shining garments 
  like a wheel<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> of fire 
  on every side of him, and in his hand is a long flail of scarlet lightning<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>; 
  his face is black<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, 
  and his eyes white without any pupil or iris<a href="#6"><font
        size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. The face is very terrible indeed 
  to look upon. Now in front of him is a wheel<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>, 
  with many spokes, and many tyres; it is like a fence<a
        href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a> in front of him. 
</p>
<p>And he cries: O man, who art thou that wouldst penetrate the Mystery<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>? 
  for it is hidden unto the End of Time<a href="#10"><font
        size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>And I answer him: Time<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a> 
  is not, save in the darkness of Her womb by whom evil came. </p>
<p>And now the wheel breaks away, and I see him as he is. His garment is black 
  beneath the opal veils, but it is lined with white, and he has the shining belly 
  of a fish, and enormous wings of black and white feathers, and innumerable little 
  legs and claws like a centipede, and a long tail like a scorpion. The breasts 
  are human, but they are all scored with blood; and he cries: O thou who hast 
  broken down the veil, knowest thou not that who cometh where I am must be scarred 
  by many sorrows<a
        href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>? </p>
<p>And I answer him: Sorrow<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a> 
  is not, save in the darkness of the womb of Her by whom came evil. </p>
<p>I pierce the Mystery<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a> 
  of his breast<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>, and 
  therein is a jewel<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
  It is a sapphire as great as an ostrich egg{<a href="#13"><font
        size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>SUP:2}, and thereon is graven this 
  sigil: </p>
<p>[Figure: This is in the form of two &quot;U&quot; shapes, very elongated in 
  the risers. The one to the right is lower than the first, and its left riser 
  extends 2/3's of the way up inside the center of the one to the left. The left 
  &quot;U&quot; turns back down to the far left, ending 1/5th the way down in 
  a tiny circle. The right bends abruptly horizontally left across the other and 
  also ends there in a tiny circle.] </p>
<p>But there is also much writing on the stone, very minute characters carved. 
  I cannot read them. He points with his flail to the sapphire, which is now outside 
  him and bigger than himself<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>; 
  and he cries: Hail! warden of the Gates of Eternity who knowest not<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a> 
  thy right hand from thy left<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>; 
  for in the aeon of my Father is a god with clasped hands wherein he holdeth 
  the universe, crushing<a href="#17"><font
        size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> it into the dust that ye call 
  stars. </p>
<p>Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right eye<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> from thy left; 
  for in the aeon of my Father there is but one light. </p>
<p>Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right nostril<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> from thy left; 
  for in the aeon of my Father there is neither life nor death. </p>
<p>Hail unto thee who knowest not thy right ear<a
        href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> from thy left; 
  for in the aeon of my Father there is neither sound nor silence. </p>
<p>Whoso hath power to break open this sapphire stone shall find therein four 
  elephants having tusks of mother-of-pearl, and upon whose backs are castles, 
  those castles which ye call the watch-towers of the Universe<a
        href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Let me dwell in peace within the breast of the Angel that is warden of the 
  aethyr. Let not the shame of my Mother be unveiled. Let not her be put to shame 
  that lieth among the lilies that are beyond the stars. </p>
<p>O man, that must ever be opening, when wilt thou learn to seal up the mysteries 
  of the creation? to fold thyself over thyself as a rose in the embrace of night? 
  But thou must play the wanton to the sun, and the wind must tear thy petals 
  from thee, and the bee must rob thee of thy honey, and thou must fall into the 
  dusk of things. Amen and Amen. </p>
<p>Verily the light is hidden, therefore he who hideth himself is like unto the 
  light; but thou openest thyself; thou art like unto the darkness that bindeth 
  the belly of the great goddess<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>OLAHO VIRUDEN MAHORELA ZODIREDA! ON PIREDA EXENTASER; ARBA PIRE GAH GAHA GAHAL 
  GAHALANA VO ABRA NA GAHA VELUCORSAPAX<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. 
</p>
<p>And the voice of the aeon cried: Return, return, return! the time sickeneth, 
  and the space gapeth, and the voice of him that is, was and shall be crowned 
  rattles in the throat of the mighty dragon of eld<a href="#21"><font
        size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. Thou canst not pass by me, except 
  thou have the mystery of the word of the abyss. </p>
<p>Now the angel putteth back the sapphire stone into his breast; and I spake 
  unto him and said, I will fight with thee and overcome thee, except thou expound 
  unto me the word of the abyss. </p>
<p>Now he makes as if to fight with me. (It is very horrible, all the tentacles 
  moving and the flail flashing, and the fierce eyeless face, strained and swollen.) 
  And with the Magic sword I pierce through his armour to his breast. He fell 
  back, saying: Each of these my scars was thus made, for I am the warden of the 
  aethyr. And he would have said more; but I cut him short, saying: expound the 
  word of the Abyss. And he said<a
        href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>: Discipline is 
  sorrowful and ploughing is laborious and age is weariness. </p>
<p>Thou shalt be vexed by dispersion<a href="#23"><font
        size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>But now, if the sun arise<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>{SUP:1}, 
  fold thou thine arms<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>; 
  then shall God smite thee into a pillar of salt<a
        href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Look not so deeply into words and letters; for this Mystery hath been hidden 
  by the Alchemists. Compose the sevenfold into a fourfold regimen<a href="#26"><font
        size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>; and when thou hast understood 
  thou mayest make symbols<a href="#27"><font
        size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>; but by playing child's games 
  with symbols thou shalt never understand<a
        href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. Thou hast the 
  signs; thou hast the words; but there are many things that are not in my power, 
  who am but the warden of the 28th Aethyr. </p>
<p>Now my name thou shalt obtain in this wise. Of the three angels of the Aethyr, 
  thou shalt write the names from right to left and from left to right and from 
  right to left, and these are the holy letters: </p>
<p>The first 1, the fifth 2, the sixth 3, the eleventh 4, the seventh 5, the twelfth 
  6, the seventeenth 7. </p>
<p>Thus hast thou my name<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a> 
  who am above these three, but the angels of the 30th Aethyr are indeed four, 
  and they have none above them; wherefore dispersion and disorder<a href="#30"><font
        size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>Now cometh from every side at once a voice, terribly great, crying: Close the 
  veil; the great blasphemy hath been uttered; the face of my Mother<a href="#31"><font
        size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a> is scarred by the nails of the 
  devil. Shut the book, destroy the breaker of the seal! </p>
<p>And I answered: Had he not been destroyed he had not come hither, for I am 
  not save in the darkness in the womb of Her<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a> 
  by whom came evil into the world. </p>
<p>And this darkness swallows everything up<a href="#33"><font
        size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>, and the angel is -------------------- 
  gone from the stone<a href="#34"><font
        size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>; and there is no light therein, 
  save only the light of the Rose and of the Cross<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>.
