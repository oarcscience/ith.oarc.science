**The Cry of the 22nd Aethyr,  
Which is Called LIN**[**1**](#1)

There comes first into the stone the mysterious table of forty-nine
squares[**2**](#2). It is surrounded by an innumerable company of
angels; these angels are of all kinds, --- some brilliant and flashing
as gods, down to elemental creatures. The light comes and goes on the
tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive that each letter of the
tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a language which
looks like that of Honorius; but when I would read, the letter that I
look at becomes indistinct at once.

And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing.
This Angel has all the colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud
and beautiful; his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and
black, like cascades of water, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of
the seven holy metals, upon which he plays[**3**](#3). I cannot tell you
how wonderful the music is, but it is so wonderful that one only lives
in one's ears; one cannot see anything any more.

Now he stops playing and moves with his finger in the air. His finger
leaves a trail of fire of every colour, so that the whole Aire is become
like a web of mingled lights. But through it all drops dew[**4**](#4).

(I can't describe these things at all. Dew doesn't represent what I mean
in the least. For instance, these drops of dew are enormous globes,
shining like the full moon, only perfectly transparent, as well as
perfectly luminous.)

And now he shows the tablet again, and he says: As there are 49 letters
in the tablet, so are there 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God.
And there are 49 interpretations of every cosmos, and each
interpretation is manifested in 49 ways. Thus also are the calls
49[**5**](#5), but to each call there are 49 visions. And each vision is
composed of 49 elements, except in the 10th Aethyr, that is accursed,
and that hath 42[**6**](#6).

All this while the dewdrops have turned into cascades of gold finer than
the eyelashes of a little child[**7**](#7). And though the extent of the
Aethyr is so enormous, one perceives each hair separately, as well as
the whole thing at once[**8**](#8). And now there is a mighty concourse
of angels rushing toward me from every side, and they melt upon the
surface of the egg in which I am standing in the form of the god
Kneph[**9**](#9), so that the surface of the egg is all one dazzling
blaze of liquid light.

Now I move up against the tablet, --- I cannot tell you with what
rapture. And all the names of God, that are not known even to the
angels[**10**](#10), clothe me about.

All the seven senses are transmuted into one sense, and that sense is
dissolved in itself ...[**11**](#11) (Here occurs Samadhi.) ... Let me
speak, O God; let me declare it ... all. It is useless; my heart faints,
my breath stops. There is no link between me and P . . .[**12**](#12) I
withdraw myself. I see the table again.

(He was behind the table for a very long time[**13**](#13). O.V.)

And all the table burns with intolerable light; there has been no such
light in any of the Aethyrs until now. And now the table draws me back
into itself; I am no more.

My arms were out in the form of a cross, and that Cross was extended,
blazing with light into infinity. I myself am the minutest point in it.
This is *the birth of form*[**14**](#14).

I am encircled by an immense sphere of many-coloured bands; it seems it
is the sphere of the Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions. This
is *the birth of death*[**15**](#15).

Now in the centre within me is a glowing sun. That is *the birth of
hell*[**16**](#16).

Now all that is swept away, washed away by the table. It is the virtue
of the table to sweep everything away. It is the letter

I in this Aethyr that gives this vision, and L is its purity, and N is
its energy[**17**](#17). Now everything is confused, for I invoked the
Mind, that is disruption[**18**](#18). Every Adept who beholds this
vision is corrupted by mind. Yet it is by virtue of mind that he endures
it, and passes on, if so be that he pass on. Yet there is nothing higher
than this, for it is perfectly balanced in itself. I cannot read a word
of the holy Table, for the letters of the Table are all wrong. They are
only the shadows of shadows. And whoso beholdeth this Table with this
rapture, is light. The true word for light hath seven letters. They are
the same as ARARITA, transmuted[**19**](#19).

There is a voice in this Aethyr, but it cannot be spoken. The only way
one can represent it is as a ceaseless thundering of the word Amen. It
is not a repetition of Amen, because there is no time. It is one Amen
continuous[**20**](#20).

Shall mine eye fade before thy glory? I am the eye. That is why the eye
is seventy[**21**](#21). You can never understand why, except in this
vision[**22**](#22).

And now the table recedes from me. Far, far it goes, streaming with
light. And there are two black angels bending over me, covering me with
their wings, shutting me up into the darkness; and I am lying in the
Pastos of our Father Christian Rosenkreutz, beneath the Table in the
Vault of seven sides. And I hear these words:

The voice of the Crowned Child, the Speech of the Babe that is hidden in
the egg of blue[**23**](#23). (Before me is the flaming Rosy Cross.) I
have opened mine eye, and the universe is dissolved before me, for force
is mine upper eye-lid and matter is my lower eye- lid**24**. I gaze into
the seven spaces, and there is naught**25**.

The rest of it comes without words; and then again:

I have gone forth to war, and I have slain him that sat upon the sea,
crowned with the winds**26**. I put forth my power and he was broken. I
withdrew my power and he was ground into fine dust**27**.

Rejoice with me, O ye Sons of the Morning; stand with me upon the Throne
of Lotus**28**; gather yourselves up unto me, and we shall play together
in the fields of light. I have passed into the Kingdom of the West after
my Father**29**.

Behold! where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation?
For ye are born into the new Aeon; ye shall not suffer death**30**. Bind
up your girdles of gold! Wreathe yourselves with garlands of my unfading
flowers! In the nights we will dance together, and in the morning we
will go forth to war; for, as my Father liveth that was dead, so do I
live and shall never die**31**.

And now the table comes rushing back. It covers the whole stone, but
this time it pushes me before it, and a terrible voice cries: Begone!
Thou hast profaned the mystery; thou hast eaten of the shew-bread; thou
hast spilt the consecrated wine**32**! Begone! For the Voice is
accomplished. Begone! For that which was open is shut. And thou shalt
not avail to open it, saving by virtue of him whose name is one, whose
spirit is one, whose individuum is one, and whose permutation is
one**33**; whose light is one, whose life is one, whose love is one. For
though thou art joined to the inmost mystery of the heaven, thou must
accomplish the sevenfold task of the earth, even as thou sawest the
Angels from the greatest unto the least. And of all this shalt thou take
back with thee but a little part, for the sense shall be darkened, and
the shrine re-veiled. Yet know this for thy reproof, and for the
stirring up of discontent in them whose swords are of lath**34**, that
in every word of this vision is concealed the key of many mysteries,
even of being, and of knowledge, and of bliss**35**; of will, of
courage, of wisdom, and of silence**36**, and of that which, being all
these, is greater than all these. Begone! For the night of life is
fallen upon thee. And the veil of light hideth that which is.

With that, I suddenly see the world as it is, and I am very sorrowful.

Bou-Sada.  
November 28, 1909. 4-6 p.m.

(*Note*. --- You do not come back in any way dazed; it is like going
from one room into another. Regained normal consciousness completely and
immediately.)

1.  <span id="1"></span>LIN = {Cancer}{Sagittarius}{Scorpio}
    {HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Samekh} {HEB:Chet} is Chassan, ruler of Air;
    also, Strength. 118 = 2 x 59. 59 = Brethren (referred especially to
    Lilith and Samael). LIN declares therefore the Twins concealed in
    Heru-Ra-Ha. 118 is also "to change, pass, renew" and "to ferment";
    indicating the Formula of Horus; His first Formula is that of
    BABALON, for He is as yet within Her womb. But see note on 10th
    Aire, regarding PARAOAN.
2.  <span id="2"></span>See *The Equinox*, I, VII, page 231. This table
    contains the names of the Angels of the Seven Planetary Spheres:
    Shabathiel, Tzedquiel, Madimiel, Shemashiel, Negahal, Kokabiel, and
    Levaniel. This seven-fold arrangement is of the Sigil of A{.·.}
    A{.·.} Babalon. See *Book of Lies*, Cap. 49. And she is the Mother
    of Heru-Ra-Ha.
3.  <span id="3"></span>This "Angel" is in fact PAN. See the 9th Aire
    "unto All hath she born him."
4.  <span id="4"></span>This "dew" is the Supernal Lion-Serpent in his
    Menstruum of liquid Pearl.
5.  <span id="5"></span>42 is the number of the Demiurge (see Genesis
    I), of the Assessors of the Dead (see any book on Egyptian
    religion), of the Sterile Mother {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Aleph}, of
    Terror and Destruction {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Bet}, of
    loss ({HEB:Yod} {HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Bet}), of the verb "to cease"
    ({HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Chet}), and of
    {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Tzaddi-final}, the Earth of Malkuth. It
    is connected with the 10th Aethyr. See *Equnox* I, VII, pages
    229-243, for the whole symbolism.
6.  <span id="6"></span>See *Equnox* I, VIII, pp. 99-128.
7.  <span id="7"></span>The Solar Child develops from the "Dew".
8.  <span id="8"></span>These violations of Normal Logic are stigmatic
    of most of the higher types of Spiritual Experience. There must be
    no muddle; that is the usual mistake made by most Mystics. Confused
    thought is the evil and averse image of the One Clear Light.
9.  <span id="9"></span>The winged Egg, the omniform Zero (0x) from
    which all positive manifestation comes.
10. <span id="10"></span>This experience is perfectly clear and
    definite, to the peculiar type of higher consciousness which is
    aware of it.
11. <span id="11"></span>These are those of the Table itself, read
    across or down, instead of diagonally, as is done to obtain the
    names given in note 5, p. 32. See also LXXXIV (page 231).
12. <span id="12"></span>Perdurabo, the Motto (in the Outer Order) of
    the Seer. Even below the True Consciousness with the material and
    intellectual basis of him.
13. <span id="13"></span>i.e. The Seer was in Samadhi; the Table had
    been a Veil of the Infinite.
14. <span id="14"></span>Form is the conception of the Self in
    extension.
15. <span id="15"></span>Death is the conception of the Self extended,
    not into the positive balanced cross, but into the negative circle
    (or sphere) of Nuit.
16. <span id="16"></span>For Hell, see *Liber Aleph*. Hell, is the
    Secret Centre of the Self. One perceives one's Star as one's True
    Self.
17. <span id="17"></span>{ENO:j} = {Sagittarius}. The Rainbow is
    connected with the Sevenfold projection. {ENO:l} = {Moon} decreasing
    in {Cancer}. Luna, when active, always purifies. It is the passive
    Moon that may be "evil"; i.e. when she reflects not the Sun, her
    Lord, but divers spectres of the Night. {ENO:n} = {Mars} in
    {Scorpio}, the type of energy which informs Vision. {Mars} in
    {Taurus} would cause action.
18. <span id="18"></span>The Seer had begun to analyze the conceptions
    presented to him by the Vision. Instantly the internal coherence of
    its Unity was destroyed. The next two phrases show that this is a
    difficulty peculiar to this Vision.
19. <span
    id="19"></span>{HEB:Resh}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Taw}
    {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Yod} the essence of the Yod girt by Sun's tending
    inwardly upon it.
    {HEB:Resh}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Resh} (?) = 412 =
    {HEB:Taw}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Bet} = {HEB:Bet} = {Mercury}. For ultimately
    Kether and Sol are not Light. Light is a duplex vibration, energized
    by Them and is, *therefore*, of their Messenger, Mercury.
    (Alostrael's notebook has a different version from Yorke's
    "...energized by Them and is {.·.} of their Messenger Mercury." ---
    Copyist's note.)
20. <span id="20"></span>AUMGN (See explanation in *Book 4*, Part III).
21. <span id="21"></span>{HEB:Nun-final}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Ayin} = an Eye =
    {HEB:Ayin} = 70.
22. <span id="22"></span>The general idea is perhaps this: 70 =
    {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Samekh}{HEB:Heh} Hush! and
    {HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Lamed}, NIght, and {HEB:Dalet}
    {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Samekh} The Secret. The Glory is so great that it
    cannot be manifested by any positive means.
23. <span id="23"></span>Heru-Ra-Ha.
24. <span id="24"></span>These ideas are complementary; when they
    combine they produce positive manifestation, which covers up the
    Glance of the Eye of Shiva, which annihilates all external
    existence.
25. <span id="25"></span>The Seven spaces are the "Palaces" which
    contain the Sephiroth.
26. <span id="26"></span>This is the foe of Horus, the Dweller of Nile.
    The winds which crown him are not the pure powers of Air of Libra,
    but the cloudy (mixed) forces of Aquarius, opposite in the Zodiac to
    Leo, the sign of Horus.
27. <span id="27"></span>The Energy of Horus destroys indeed, but must
    be withdrawn to complete the work, for His rays, if left in their
    object, would keep it vitalized. The coherence of the broken matter
    must be withdrawn.
28. <span id="28"></span>Harpocrates stands or sits upon the Lotus, his
    fortress against the malice of the Water-demon.
29. <span id="29"></span>Osiris has been chased into Amennti by Horus,
    who follows him thither, that his reign may be established even in
    the realms of "Death". In the New Aeon, Death is become Life
    Triumphant, not through Resurrection, but in its own Essence.
30. <span id="30"></span>See last note. The Thelemite does not "suffer
    death". He is eternal and perceives Himself the Universe, by virtue
    of the *categories* of Life and Death, which are not real but
    subjective forms of his artistic presentation.
31. <span id="31"></span>Osiris, tricked into the belief in death, had
    to overcome it by Magick, the Formula IAO.
32. <span id="32"></span>The Seer has erred, it seems, by translating
    the Doctrine into intelligible symbols. for this is likely to cause
    a new "Fall" into the barren kingdoms of Ratiocination.
33. <span id="33"></span>ARARITA (--- a name of God, which is a
    Notariqon of the sentence: "One is His beginning; One is his
    Individuality; His Permutation One.") The use of this Name and
    Formula is to equate and identify every idea with its opposite; thus
    being released from the obsession of thinking any one of them as
    "true" (and therefore binding); one can withdraw oneself from the
    whole sphere of the Ruach. See *Liber 813, vel Ararita.* Contrast
    each verse of Cap. I with the corresponding verse of Cap. II for the
    first of these methods. Thus in Cap. III (stil verse by verse
    correspondence) the Quintessence of the ideas is extracted; and in
    Cap. IV they are withdrawn each one into the one beyond it. In Cap.
    V they have disappeared into the Method itself. In Cap. VI they
    reappear in the Form appointed by the Will of the Adept. Lastly, in
    Cap. VII they are dissolved, one into the next until all finally
    disappear in the Fire Qadosh, the Quintessence of Reality.
34. <span id="34"></span>Those whose analytical methods are incapable of
    destroying Illusion. This insistence on the Virtue of the Vision is
    intended to encourage them to make greater efforts.
35. <span id="35"></span>Sat-Chit-Ananda.
36. <span id="36"></span>The Sphinx.
