**The Cry of the 18th Aethyr,  
Which is Called ZEN**[**1**](#1)

A Voice comes before any vision: Accursed are they who enter herein if
they have nails, for they shall be pierced therewith; or if they have
thorns, for they shall be crowned withal; or if they have whips, for
with whips they shall be scourged: or if they bear wine, for their wine
shall be turned to bitterness; or if they have a spear, for with a spear
shall they be pierced unto the heart. And the nails are desires, of
which there are three; the desire of light, the desire of life, the
desire of love[**2**](#2).

(And the thorns are thoughts, and the whips are regrets, and the wine is
ease, or perhaps unsteadiness, especially in ecstasy, and the spear is
attachment.)

And now there dawns the scene of the Crucifixion; but the Crucified One
is an enormous bat, and for the two thieves are two little children. It
is night, and the night is full of hideous things and
howlings[**3**](#3).

And an angel cometh forth, and saith: Be wary, for if thou change so
much as the style of a letter, the holy word is blasphemed[**4**](#4).
But enter into the mountain of the Caverns, for that this (how much more
then that Calvary which mocks it, as his ape mocks Thoth?) is but the
empty shell of the mystery of ZEN. Verily, I say unto thee, many are the
adepts that have looked upon the back parts of my father, and cried,
"our eyes fail before the glory of thy countenance[**5**](#5)."

And with that he gives the sign of the rending of the veil, and tears
down the vision. And behold! whirling columns of fiery light, seventy-
two[**6**](#6). Upon them is supported a mountain of pure crystal. The
mountain is a cone, the angle of the apex being sixty
degrees[**7**](#7). And within the crystal is a pyramid of
ruby[**8**](#8), like unto the Great Pyramid of Gizeh.

I am entered in by the little door thereof, and I am come into the
chamber of the king, which is fashioned like unto the vault of the
adepts, or rather it is fitting to say that the vault of the adepts is a
vile imitation of it. For there are four sides to the chamber, which
with the roof and the floor and the chamber itself makes
seven[**9**](#9). So also is the pastos seven[**10**](#10), for that
which is within is like unto that which is without. And there is no
furniture, and there are no symbols.

Light streams from every side upon the pastos. This light is that blue
of Horus which we know, but being refined it is brilliance. For the
light of Horus only appears blue because of the imperfection of our
eyes[**11**](#11). But though the light pours from the pastos, yet the
pastos remains perfectly dark, so that it is invisible. It hath no form:
only, at a certain point in the chamber, the light is beaten
back[**12**](#12).

I lie prostate upon the ground before this mystery. Its splendour is
impossible to describe. I can only say that its splendour is so great
that my heart stops with the terror and the wonder and the rapture of
it[**13**](#13). I am almost mad. A million insane images chase each
other through my brain...[**14**](#14) A voice comes: (it is my own
voice -- I did not know it). "When thou shalt know me, O thou empty God,
my little flame shall utterly expire in thy great N.O.X.[**15**](#15)"
There is no answer[**16**](#16). ... (20 minutes. O.V.) ...

And now, after so long a while, the Angel[**17**](#17) lifts me and
takes me from the room[**18**](#18), and sets me in a little
chamber[**19**](#19) where is another Angel like a fair youth in shining
garments, who makes me partake of the sacraments; bread, that is labour;
and fire, that is wit; and a rose, that is sin; and wine, that is
death[**20**](#20). And all about us is a great company of angels in
many-coloured robes, rose and spring-green, and sky-blue, and pale gold,
and silver, and lilac, solemnly chanting without words. It is music
wonderful beyond all that can be thought.

And now we go out of the chamber; on the right is a pylon, and the right
figure is Isis, and the left figure Nephthys, and they are folding their
wings over, and supporting Ra[**21**](#21).

I wanted to go back to the King's Chamber[**22**](#22). The Angel pushed
me away, saying: "Thou shalt see these visions from afar off, but thou
shalt not partake of them save in the manner prescribed. For if thou
change so much as the style of a letter, the holy word is
blasphemed.[**23**](#23)"

And this is the manner prescribed:

Let there be a room furnished as for the ritual of passing through
Tuat[**24**](#24). And let the aspirant be clad in the robes of, and let
him bear the insignia of his grade. And at the least he shall be a
neophyte[**25**](#25).

Three days and three nights shall he have been in the tomb, vigilant and
fasting, for he shall sleep no longer than three hours at any one time,
and he shall drink pure water, and eat little sweet cakes consecrated
unto the moon, and fruits, and the eggs of the duck, or of the goose, or
of the plover. And he shall be shut in, so that no man may break in upon
his meditation. But in the last twelve hours he shall neither eat nor
sleep.

Then shall he break his fast, eating rich food, and drinking sweet
wines, and wines that foam[**26**](#26); and he shall banish the
elements and the planets and the signs and the sephiroth[**27**](#27);
and then shall he take the holy table that he hath made for his altar;
and he shall take the call of the Aethyr of which he will partake, which
he hath written in the angelic character, or in the character of the
holy alphabet that is revealed in Pop, upon a fair sheet of virgin
vellum; and therewith shall he conjure the Aethyr, chanting the call.
And in the lamp that is hung above the altar shall he burn the call that
he hath written[**28**](#28).

Then shall he kneel[**29**](#29) before the holy table, and it shall be
given him to partake of the mystery of the Aethyr.

And concerning the ink with which he shall write; for the first Aethyr
let it be gold, for the second scarlet, for the third violet, for the
fourth emerald, for the fifth silver, for the sixth sapphire, for the
seventh orange, for the eighth indigo, for the ninth gray, for the tenth
black, for the eleventh maroon, for the twelfth russet, for the
thirteenth green-gray, for the fourteenth amber, for the fifteenth
olive, for the sixteenth pale blue, for the seventeenth crimson, for the
eighteenth bright yellow, for the nineteenth crimson adorned with
silver, for the twentieth mauve, for the twenty-first pale green, for
the twenty-second rose-madder, for the twenty-third violet cobalt, for
the twenty-fourth beetle-brown, blue-brown colour, for the twenty-fifth
a cold dark gray, for the twenty- sixth white flecked with red, blue,
and yellow; the edges of the letters shall be green, for the
twenty-seventh angry clouds of ruddy brown, for the twenty-eighth
indigo, for the twenty-ninth bluish-green, for the thirtieth mixed
colours[**30**](#30).

This shall be the form to be used by him who would partake of the
mystery of any Aethyr. And let him not change so much as the style of a
letter, lest the holy word be blasphemed.

And let him beware, after he hath been permitted to partake of this
mystery, that he await the completion of the 91st hour of his
retirement, before he open the door of the place of his retirement; lest
he contaminate his glory with uncleanness, and lest they that behold him
be smitten by his glory unto death[**31**](#31).

For this is a holy mystery, and he that did first attain to reveal the
alphabet thereof[**32**](#32), perceived not one ten-thousandth part of
the fringe that is upon its vesture.

Come away! for the clouds are gathered together, and the Aire heaveth
like the womb of a woman in travail. Come away! lest he loose the
lightnings from his hand, and unleash his hounds of thunder. Come away!
For the voice of the Aethyr is accomplished. Come away! For the seal of
His loving-kindness is made sure. And let there be praise and blessing
unspeakable unto him that sitteth upon the Holy Throne, for he casteth
down mercies as a spendthrift that scattereth gold. And he hath shut up
judgment and hidden it away as a miser that hoardeth coins of little
worth[**33**](#33).

All this while the Angel hath been pushing me backwards, and now he is
turned into a golden cross with a rose at its heart, and that is the red
cross wherein is set the golden shewstone.

    {HEB:Bet} {HEB:Aleph}, a manger, stable, enclosure. This Aethyr
    describes the Place of the Preliminary Ceremony of the Initiation of
    the Master of the Temple. The Candidate is fortified for the Ordeal
    of Intimate Communion with his Holy Guardian Angel, who comes upon
    him unaware, and prepares him interiorly below any normal sphere of
    consciousness.
2.  <span id="2"></span>The Exempt Adept must be freed from all
    attachment.
3.  <span id="3"></span>The aspirant is reminded by this vision of the
    horror which is always ready to take the place of a True Magical
    Operation. Coruptio optimi pessima.

7.  <span id="7"></span>The cone is a figure of Iacchus, Lord of the
    Highest Ecstasy. It is the Phallus. Its mathematical implications
    are many and important. In particular, its relations with the Great

9.  <span id="9"></span>Similarly, the Hexagram is attributed to the
    Seven Planets; for the Centre contains {Sun}.
10. <span id="10"></span>Compare this whole geometrical symbolism with
    that given in the Ritual of Adeptus Minor.
11. <span id="11"></span>Compare, in external nature, the appearance of
    the blue sky.
12. <span id="12"></span>This very strange phenomenon is perhaps quite
    inadequately described. It is a general condition of most Spiritual
    Experience that the familiar laws of Nature do not obtain in their
    accustomed forms. It is only when Experience enables one to observe
    them with detachment that they are seen to be as uniform, simple and
    exact as those of normal physics.
13. <span id="13"></span>Compare with this unlighted, light-radiating
    Pastos, the Boundless Cube in the Vision of Pure Love: "In the
    morning I woke early, before 7, in an absolutely renewed physical
    condition. I had the clean fresh feeling of a healthy boyhood, and
    was alert and active as a kitten --- post talem mortem! Mentally, I
    woke into *Pure Love*. This was symbolized as a cube\* of blue-white
    light like a diamond of the best quality. It was lucid, translucent,
    self-luminous, and yet not radiating forth. I suppose because there
    was nothing else in the Cosmos." \*. I say "a cube", yet its most
    salient property was that it was without boundaries. Experience of
    similar trances is necessary for the understanding of this
    statement, which is a perfectly proper expression of a a perfectly
    observed fact, despite its intellectual self-contradiction. This
    withdrawal from sense of the Pastos, which is the Inmost and most
    sacred Self of the Aspirant, is the surrender of "all that he has
    and all that he is" on entering the Abyss.
14. <span id="14"></span>There is a fleeting Image of the Horror of the
    Abyss, as a mountaineer, leaping a Bergschrund, obtains a momentary
    glimpse of the Terrors beneath his airy Path. Cf. 10th Aire for
    these images of madness.
15. <span id="15"></span>This quotation is from *Liber VII* I, v. 40.
    (This Book describes in detail the whole Attainment of the Grade of
    Magister Templi. It had been given to the Seer, years previously;
    but he had not understood it, even with his Neshamah, as a coherent
    entity. Nor does he even yet (An XXI, {Sun} in {Cancer}) understand
    it with his Rauch. Incidentally the full meaning of this Book 418,
    as a connected account of his Initiation, is only now becoming clear
    to him in the process of writing this Commentary upon it. For
    N.O.X., see Note above, 20th Aire. Observe that although the Exempt
    Adept, or the Babe of the Abyss, is completely baffled by the
    circumstances, and in no wise understands the situation, his Chiah,
    the Magician in him, acts with sublime confidence and correctness.
16. <span id="16"></span>The quotation, accepting annihilation,
    instantly destroys the myriad of insane images which hastened to
    occupy the vacuum created by the leap of the Exempt Adept into the
    Abyss. Had he faltered, he would have become --- against his will
    --- a "Black Brother". But this being involuntary, he would not have
    attempted to maintain his coherence, as the Black Brothers do. He
    would therefore, have been destroyed at once; that is, to outward
    appearance he would have become a demented babbler. Spiritists
    present this phenomenon, on a much lower plane, and in a diluted
    form; though, with them as with the average Theosophist, there is
    usually a certain degree of obsession by pet phantoms --- a "Chinese
    Guide," or "Koot Hoomi," or what not --- to lend a species of
    semi-organized structure to the legions of disconnected ideas that
    throng their disintegrated gray matter.
17. <span id="17"></span>(No Angel has been mentioned. The Seer was lost
    to being.) In this preliminary --- and so to say, symbolic ---
    crossing of the Abyss, His Holy Guardian Angel comes to the rescue
    of the Aspirant. Contrast the unspeakable Terror of the actual
    Crossing, when that Angel Himself abandons the Seer (see 11th Aire,
    the last paragraph.) Exactly how the Angel dealt with the Seer in
    this 20 minutes of earthly time is impossible to say; for he has no
    memory soever --- nor had he even at the time --- of what took
    place. We may, however, deduce from the fact that the Communion took
    place in a sphere beyond even Neschamah. It may well have been a
    Quintessence of Union sufficiently intimate to have identified the
    Seer with his Angel so perfectly as to have given him the right to
    make the passage fully, in every sense; and to have ensured his
    safety on the way. For the Angel cometh forth from above the Abyss,
    and dwelleth of right in the Bosom of the Great Mother. But the
    Angel deals not with the little pile of dust in the City of the
    Pyramids, (see [14th Aethyr](aetyr14)) but with the Star that is
    cast forth to give light to the Earth.
18. <span id="18"></span>This pyramid, where is the Pastos, is the
    Chamber of Annihilation. The Pastos contains the Essence of the
    Aspirant, and is in a Chamber containing the Essence of the
    Universe. This is all ready to be burnt up in the Energy of
    Aspiration to the Creative Annihilation, the Ruby Pyramid of
    Phallus. Finally, this Pyramid is within a Cone, a figure combining
    the straight line and the circle (Rose and Cross in their purest
    form) representing the new Universe into which the Old is to be
    transmuted. It is established, like all types of Universe, upon the
    Four Elements (divided into 72) which are the conditions of
    manifested Existence. (The elements are not only "material"; they
    include categories like "Time", "Space" and "Causality".)
19. <span id="19"></span>This is the Birth-Chamber, where the Magister
    Templi awakes from the Oblivion of the Abyss.
20. <span id="20"></span>These sacraments furnish him with the material
    of his new Life. Bread ({Spirit}) is labour, the nourishment of his
    being. Fire is the perception of clear understanding (Neschamah).
    The Rose ({Air}) is Sin, the restriction which prevents him from
    being dissolved in pure light (Kether) for his Oath as a Master of
    the Temple is to deny himself the enjoyment of that privilege, for
    the sake of the Love that he bears to Mankind; wherefore is that Sin
    fragrant with the sent of love. Finally, Wine ({Water}) is Death,
    the Ecstasy of transmuting all things into Joy by the Sacrament of
    Creative Love.
21. <span id="21"></span>Isis, Nature, and Nephthys, Perfection, preside
    over the Arising of the New Star. The Magister Templi is a little
    pyramid of dust in the City of the Pyramids (see 14th Aire) awaiting
    the Fire that shall burn him up to a white Ash (see 6th Aire). But
    the original combination of Sankharas (tendencies --- the elements
    of the Character of the Man) is void of the Ego. Ahamkara (the
    ego-making faculty) has been assimilated. The Sankharas are,
    however, still linked by the Karma of the Adept; for they had to be
    most strongly knit by him that he might be able to concentrate their
    whole Energies upon the Great Work of abandoning in a single gesture
    "all that he has and all that he is". They accordingly hold
    together: His Will has been accomplished, and he is free from them;
    but they depend upon the Elements which compose that true Will,
    which, *since he has succeeded*, can only be that Sublime Passion
    for Mankind, to help it to "Conquer Space, and lastly climb the
    walls of Time, and by the Golden Path the great have trod, Reach up
    to God." A phenomenon of this nature thus appears "as a morning
    star, or as an evening star, to give light to them that sit in
    darkness, and in the shadow of death". This is then the man himself,
    save that his separate individuality is no longer present; it is
    replaced by this single passion to rescue mankind.
22. <span id="22"></span>The Seer's first impulse was to proceed with
    the Work on which he had been engaged when the Dissolution of his
    Being took place.
23. <span id="23"></span>As stated in a previous Aire, these higher
    visions are not to be obtained by the methods applicable to less
    exalted spheres.
24. <span id="24"></span>See the Book of the Dead, as adopted for modern
    use by the Authorities of the G{.·.} D{.·.}
25. <span id="25"></span>He must be a neophyte to have access to the
    Ritual of Passing Through the Tuat.
26. <span id="26"></span>See *Liber AL*, I. v. 51. The general idea is
    to create true appetite in a body purified by fasting and a mind
    clarified by meditation, so as to make certain of being perfectly
    intoxicated. It should be needless to say that this state of mind,
    like all others, should be absolutely willed, criticized and
    controlled.
27. <span id="27"></span>The Aethyrs pertain to an order of nature, *sui
    generis*. Though they possess many correspondences with the 32 Paths
    of Wisdom, all of these must be impartially banished; otherwise the
    Vacuum would be disturbed by an unequilibrated symbol sympathetic
    with the Aire to be invoked, which would flood the circle, and
    prevent the Aethyr arising in its perfect plenitude.
28. <span id="28"></span>This injunction has several obvious Magical
    advantages. The symbolic gesture is to consume the matter of the
    Operation in the Spirit thereof.
29. <span id="29"></span>This is by no means a gesture of supplication,
    the vile attitude of the unmanly devotee of the Slave-Gods. It has
    as specific and positive practical purpose, which should be easy for
    the Neophyte to divine if his Zelator have well and wisely so
    instructed him.

31. <span id="31"></span>This injunction is to be taken very seriously.
    I have known uninitiates made ill by the shock of seeing Adepts of
    too high "residual charge"; worse, thrown off their moral balance.
32. <span id="32"></span>Presumably Sir Edward Kelly. There is certainly
    no hint of the sublimity and profundity of such visions as the
    present series in the working of that adept.
33. <span id="33"></span>This peroration suggests that early working by
    its style. It has little definite thought contained in it; the
    sublimity of the language ill conceals its vagueness. Nevertheless,
    it is a fitting conclusion to the mystery of this Aire. The ritual,
    and its lyrical outburst, were doubtless necessary to let the seer
    down gently from the colossal exaltation of the central event of the
    Aethyr.
