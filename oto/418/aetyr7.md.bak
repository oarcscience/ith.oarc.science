**The Cry of the 7th Aethyr,  
Which is Called DEO**[**1**](#1.md)

The stone is divided, the left half dark, the right half light, and at
the bottom thereof is a certain blackness, of three divergent columns.
And it seems as if the black and white halves are the halves of a door,
and in the door is a little key-hole, in the shape of the Astrological
symbol of Venus. And from the key-hole issue flames, blue and green and
violet, but without any touch of yellow or red in them. It seems as if
there were a wind beyond the door, that is blowing the flame out.

And a voice comes: "Who is he that hath the key to the gate of the
evening star?"

And now an Angel cometh and seeketh to open the door by trying many
keys. And they are none of any avail. And the same voice saith: "The
five and the six are balanced in the word Abrahadabra, and therein is
the mystery disclosed. But the key unto this gate is the balance of the
seven and the four; and of this thou hast not even the first letter. Now
there is a word of four letters that containeth in itself all the
mystery of the Tetragrammaton[**2**](#2.md), and there is a word of seven
letters which it concealeth[**3**](#3.md), and that again concealeth the
holy word that is the key of the abyss[**4**](#4.md). And this thou shalt
find, revolving it in thy mind.

Hide therefore thine eyes. And I will set my key in the lock, and open
it. Yet still let thine eyes be hidden, for thou canst not bear the
glory that is within.

So, therefore, I covered mine eyes with my hands. Yet through my hands
could I perceive a little of those bowers of azure flame.

And a voice said: It is kindled into fire that was the blue breast of
ocean; because this is the bar of heaven, and the feet of the Most High
are set thereon.

Now I behold more fully: Each tongue of flame, each leaf of flame, each
flower of flame, is one of the great love-stories of the world, with all
its retinue of *mise-en-sc ne*. And now there is a most marvelous rose
formed from the flame, and a perpetual rain of lilies and
passion-flowers and violets. And there is gathered out of it all, yet
identical with it, the form of a woman like the woman in the Apocalypse,
but her beauty and her radiance are such that one cannot look thereon,
save with sidelong glances. I enter immediately into trance. It seems
that it is she of whom it is written, "The fool hath said in his heart
'there is no God.'" But the words are not Ain Elohim, but La (=nay!) and
Elohim contracted from 86 to 14, because La is 31, which x 14 is 434,
Daleth, Lamed, Tau. This fool is the fool of the Path of Aleph, and
sayeth, which is Chokmah, in his heart, which is Tiphereth, that she
existeth, in order first that the Wisdom may be joined with the
Understanding; and he affirmeth her in Tiphereth that she may be
fertile.

It is impossible to describe how this vision changeth from glory unto
glory, for at each glance the vision is changed. And this is because she
transmitteth the Word to the Understanding, and therefore hath she many
forms, and each goddess of love is but a letter of the alphabet of love.

Now, there is a mystery in the word Logos, that containeth the three
letters whose analogy hath been shown in the lower heavens, Samech, and
Lamed, and Gimel, that are 93, which is thrice 31, and in them are set
the two eyes of Horus[**5**](#5). (Ayin means an eye..md) For, if it were
not so, the arrow could not pierce the rainbow, and there could be no
poise in the balance, and the Great Book should never be unsealed. But
this is she that poureth the Water of Life upon her head, whence it
floweth to fructify the earth[**6**](#6.md). But now the whole Aethyr is
the most brilliant peacock blue. It *is* the Universal Peacock that I
behold.

And there is a voice: Is not this bird the bird of Juno, that is an
hundred, and thirty, and six[**7**](#7.md)? And therefore is she the mate
of Jupiter[**8**](#8.md).

And now the peacock's head is again changed into a woman's head
sparkling and coruscating with its own light of gems.

But I look upwards, seeing that she is called the footstool of the Holy
One, even as Binah is called His throne. And the whole Aethyr is full of
the most wonderful bands of light, --- a thousand different curves and
whorls, even as it was before, when I spake mysteries of the Holy
Qabalah, and so could not describe it.

Oh, I see vast plains beneath her feet, enormous deserts studded with
great rocks; and I see little lonely souls, running helplessly about,
minute black creatures like men[**9**](#9.md). And they keep up a very
curious howling, that I can compare to nothing that I have ever heard;
yet it is strangely human.

And the voice says: These are they that grasped love and clung thereto,
praying ever at the knees of the great goddess. These are they that have
shut themselves up in fortresses of Love.

Each plume of the peacock is full of eyes, that are at the same time 4 x
7. And for this is the number 28 reflected down into Netzach; and that
28 is Kaph Cheth (Kach), power. For she is Sakti, the eternal energy of
the Concealed One. And it is her eternal energy that hath made this
eternal change. And this explaineth the call of the Aethyrs, the curse
that was pronounced in the beginning being but the creation of Sakti.
And this mystery is reflected in the legend of the Creation, where Adam
represents the Concealed One, for Adam is Temurah of MAD, the Enochian
word for God, and Eve, whom he created for love, is tempted by the
snake, Nechesh, who is Messiah her child. And the snake is the magical
power, which hath destroyed the primordial equilibrium.

And the garden is the supernal Eden, where is Ayin, 70, the Eye of the
Concealed One, and the creative Lingam; and Daleth, love; and Nun the
serpent[**10**](#10.md). And therefore this constitution was implicitly in
the nature of Eden (cf. *Liber L*., I., 29, 30), so that the call of the
Aethyrs could not have been any other call than that which it is.

But they that are without understanding have interpreted all this askew,
because of the Mystery of the Abyss, for there is no Path from Binah
unto Chesed; and therefore the course of the Flaming Sword was no more a
current, but a spark. And when the Stooping Dragon raised his head unto
Dath in the course of that spark, there was, as it were, an explosion,
and his head was blasted. And the ashes thereof were dispersed
throughout the whole of the 10th Aethyr. And for this, all knowledge is
piecemeal, and it is of no value unless it be co-ordinated by
Understanding.

And now the form of the Aethyr is the form of a mighty Eagle of ruddy
brass. And the plumes are set alight, and are whirled round and round
until the whole heaven is blackness with these flying sparks therein.

Now it is all branching streams of golden fire tipped with scarlet at
the edges[**11**](#11.md).

And now She cometh forth again, riding upon a dolphin. Now again I see
those wandering souls, that have sought restricted love, and have not
understood that "the word of sin is restriction."

It is very curious; they seem to be looking for one another or for
something, all the time, constantly hurrying about. But they knock up
against one another and yet will not see one another, or cannot see one
another, because they are so shut up in their cloaks.

And a voice sounds: It is most terrible for the one that hath shut
himself up and made himself fast against the universe. For they that sit
encamped upon the sea in the city of the Pyramids are indeed shut up.
But they have given their blood, even to the last drop, to fill the cup
of BABALON.

These that thou seest are indeed the Black Brothers, for it is written:
"He shall laugh at their calamity and mock them when their fear cometh."
And therefore hath he exalted them unto the plane of love.

And yet again it is written: He desireth not the death of a sinner, but
rather that he should turn from his wickedness. Now, if one of these
were to cast off his cloak he should behold the brilliance of the lady
of the Aethyr; but they will not.

And yet again there is another cause wherefore He hath permitted them to
enter thus far within the frontiers of Eden, so that His thought should
never swerve from compassion. But do thou behold the brilliance of Love,
that casteth forth seven stars upon thine head from her right hand, and
crowneth thee with a crown of seven roses. Behold! She is seated upon
the throne of turquoise and lapis lazuli, and she is like a flawless
emerald, and upon the pillars that support the canopy of her throne are
sculptured the Ram, and the Sparrow, and the Cat, and a strange
fish[**12**](#12.md). Behold! How she shineth! Behold! How her glances have
kindled all these fires that have blown about the heavens! Yet remember
that in every one there goeth forth for a witness the justice of the
Most High. Is not Libra the House of Venus? And there goeth forth a
sickle that shall reap every flower. Is not Saturn exalted in Libra?
Daleth, Lamed, Tau[**13**](#13.md).

And therefore was he a fool who uttered her name in his heart, for the
root of evil is the root of breath, and the speech in the silence was a
lie.

Thus is it seen from below by them that understand not. But from above
he rejoiceth, for the joy of dissolution is ten thousand, and the pang
of birth but a little[**14**](#14.md).

And now thou shalt go forth from the Aethyr, for the voice of the Aethyr
is hidden and concealed from thee because thou hadst not the key of the
door thereof, and thine eyes were not able to bear the splendour of the
vision. But thou shalt meditate upon the mysteries thereof, and upon the
lady of the Aethyr; and it may be by the wisdom of the Most High that
the true voice of the Aethyr, that is continual song, may be heard of
thee.

Return therefore instantly unto the earth, and sleep not for a while;
but withdraw thyself from this matter. And it shall be enough.

Thus then was I obedient unto the voice, and returned into my body.

W'ain-T-Aissha, Algeria.  
December 9, 1909. 8:10-10 p.m.
