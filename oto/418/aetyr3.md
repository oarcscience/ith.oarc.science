**The Cry of the 3rd Aethyr**[**1**](#1.md)**,  
Which is Called ZON**[**2**](#2.md)

There is an angry light in the stone; now it is become clear.

In the centre is that minute point of light which is the true Sun, and
in the circumference is the Emerald Snake. And joining them are the rays
which are the plumes of Maat, and because the distance is infinite,
therefore are they parallel from the circumference, although they
diverge from the centre.

In all this is no voice and no motion.

And yet it seems that the great Snake feedeth upon the plumes of Truth
as upon itself, so that it contracteth[**3**](#3.md). But ever so little as
it contracteth, without it gloweth the golden rim, which is that minute
point in the centre.

And all this is the sigil of the Aethyr, gold and azure and green. Yet
also these are the Severities.

It is only in the first three Aethyrs that we find the pure essence, for
all the other Aethyrs are but as Malkuth to complete these three triads,
as hath before been said. And this being the second reflection,
therefore is it the palace of two hundred and eighty
judgments[**4**](#4.md).

For all these paths[**5**](#5.md) are in the course of the Flaming Sword
from the side of Severity. And the other two paths are Zayin, which is a
sword; and Shin, which is a tooth. These are then the five severities
which are 280.

All this is communicated to the Seer interiorly.

"And the eye of His benignancy is closed. Let it not be opened upon the
Aethyr, lest the severities be mitigated, and the house
fall.[**6**](#6.md)" Shall not the house fall, and the Dragon sink? Verily
all things have been swallowed up in destruction; and Chaos hath opened
his jaws and crushed the Universe as a Bacchanal crusheth a grape
between her teeth. Shall not destruction swallow up destruction, and
annihilation confound annihilation? Twenty and two are the
mansions[**7**](#7.md) of the House of my Father, but there cometh an
ox[**8**](#8.md) that shall set his forehead against the House, and it
shall fall. For all these things are the toys of the Magician[**9**](#9.md)
and the Maker of Illusions, that barreth the Understanding from the
Crown.

O thou that hast beheld the City of the Pyramids, how shouldst thou
behold the House of the Juggler[**10**](#10.md)? For he is wisdom, and by
wisdom hath he made the Worlds, and from that wisdom issue judgements 70
by 4, that are the 4 eyes of the double-headed one; that are the 4
devils, Satan, Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial, that are the great princes of
the evil of the world[**11**](#11.md).

And Satan is worshipped by men under the name of Jesus; and Lucifer is
worshipped by men under the name of Brahma; and Leviathan is worshipped
by men under the name of Allah; and Belial is worshipped by men under
the name of Buddha.

(This is the meaning of the passage in *Liber Legis*, Chap.
III.)[**12**](#12.md)

Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut
herself up[**13**](#13.md); and therefore is she the Queen of all those
wicked devils that walk upon the earth, those that thou sawest even as
little black specks that stained the Heaven of Urania. And all these are
the excrement of Choronzon.

And for this is BABALON under the power of the Magician, that she hath
submitted herself unto the work; and she guardeth the
Abyss[**14**](#14.md). And in her is a perfect purity of that which is
above; yet she is sent as the Redeemer to them that are below. For there
is no other way into the Supernal Mystery but through her, and the Beast
on which she rideth; and the Magician is set beyond her to deceive the
brothers of blackness, lest they should make unto themselves a
crown[**15**](#15.md); for if there were two crowns, then should Ygdrasil,
that ancient tree, be cast out into the Abyss, uprooted and cast down
into the Outermost Abyss, and the Arcanum which is in the Adytum should
be profaned; and the Ark should be touched, and the Lodge spied upon by
them that are not masters, and the bread of the Sacrament should be the
dung of Choronzon; and the wine of the Sacrament should be the water of
Choronzon; and the incense should be dispersion; and the fire upon the
Altar should be hate. But lift up thyself; stand, play the man, for
behold! there shall be revealed unto thee the Great Terror, the thing of
awe that hath no name.

And this is the mystery that I declare unto thee: that from the Crown
itself spring the three great delusions; Aleph is madness, and Beth is
falsehood, and Gimel is glamour[**16**](#16.md). And these three be greater
than all, for they are beyond the words that I speak unto thee; how much
more therefore are they beyond the words that thou transmittest unto
men.

Behold! the Veil of the Aethyr sundereth, and is torn, like a sail by
the breath of the tempest, and thou shalt see him as from afar off. This
is that which is written, "Confound her understanding with darkness,"
for thou canst not speak this thing[**17**](#17.md).

It is the figure of the Magus of the Taro[**18**](#18.md); and in his right
arm the torch of the flames blazing upwards; in his left the cup of
poison, a cataract into Hell. And upon his head the evil talisman,
blasphemy and blasphemy and blasphemy, in the form of a circle. That is
the greatest blasphemy of all[**19**](#19.md). On his feet hath he the
scythes and swords and sickles; daggers; knives; every sharp
thing[**20**](#20.md), --- a millionfold, and all in one. And before him is
the Table that is a Table of wickedness, and 42-fold Table. This Table
is connected with the 42 Assessors of the Dead, for they are the
Accursers, whom the soul must baffle; and with the 42-fold name of God,
for this is the Mystery of Iniquity, that there was ever a beginning at
all[**21**](#21.md). And this Magus casteth forth, by the might of his four
weapons, veil after veil; a thousand shining colours, ripping and
tearing the Aethyr, so that it is like jagged saws, or like broken teeth
in the face of a young girl, or like disruption, or madness. There is a
horrible grinding sound, maddening. This is the mill in which the
Universal Substance, which is ether, was ground down into matter.

The Seer prayeth that a cloud may come between him and the sun, so that
he may shut out the terror of the vision. And he is afire; he is
terribly athirst; and no help can come to him, for the shew-stone
blazeth ever with the fury and the torment and the blackness, and the
stench of human flesh. The bowels of little children are torn out and
thrust into his mouth, and a poison is dropped into his eyes. And
Lilith[**22**](#22.md), a black monkey crawling with filth, running with
open sores, an eye torn out, eaten of worms, her teeth rotten, her nose
eaten away, her mouth a putrid mass of green slime, her dugs dropping
and cancerous, clings to him, kisses him.

(Kill me! kill me!)[**23**](#23.md)

There is a mocking voice: Thou art become immortal. Thou wouldst look
upon the face of the Magician and thou hast not beheld him because of
his Magick veils.

(Don't torture me!)

Thus are all they fallen into the power of Lilith, who have dared to
look upon his face.

The shew-stone is all black and corrupt. O filth! filth! filth!

And this is her great blasphemy: that she hath taken the name of the
First Aethyr[**24**](#24.md), and bound it on her brow, and added thereunto
the shameless yod and the tau for the sign of the Cross.

She it is that squatteth upon the Crucifix, for the nastiness of her
pleasure. So that they that worship Christ suck up her filth upon their
tongues, and therefore their breaths stink[**25**](#25.md).

I was saved from that Horror by a black shining Triangle, with apex
upwards[**26**](#26.md), that came upon the face of the sun.

And now the shew-stone is all clear and beautiful again.

The pure pale gold of a fair maiden's hair, and the green of her girdle,
and the deep soft blue of her eyes.

*Note*. --- In this the gold is Kether, the blue is Chokmah, the green
is Binah.

Thus she appeareth in the Aethyr, adorned with flowers and gems. It
seems that she hath incarnated herself upon earth, and that she will
appear manifest in a certain office in the Temple.

I have seen some picture like her face; I cannot think what picture. It
is a piquant face, with smiling eyes and lips; the ears are small and
pink, the complexion is fair, but not transparent; not as fair as one
would expect from the hair and eyes. It is rather an impudent face,
rather small, very pretty; the nose very slightly less than straight,
well- proportioned, rather large nostrils. Full of vitality, the whole
thing. Now very tall, rather slim and graceful; a good dancer.

There is another girl behind her, with sparkling eyes, mischievous, a
smile showing beautiful white teeth; an ideal Spanish girl, but fair.
Very vivacious. Only her head is visible, and now it is veiled by a
black sun, casting forth dull rays of black and gold.

Then the disk of the sun is a pair of balances, held steady; and twined
about the central pole of the balance is the little green poisonous
snake, with a long forked tongue rapidly darting[**27**](#27.md).

And the Angel that hath spoken with me before, saith to me: The eye of
His benignancy is opened; therefore veileth he thine eyes from the
vision. Manfully hast thou endured; yet, hast thou been man, thou hadst
not endured; and hadst thou been wholly that which thou art, thou
shouldst have been caught up in the full vision that is unspeakable for
Horror. And thou shouldst have beheld the face of the Magician that thou
hast not been able to behold, - of him from whom issue forth the
severities that are upon Malkuth, and his name is Misericordia Dei.

And because he is the dyad, thou mayest yet understand in two ways. Of
first way, the Mercy of God is that Mercy which Jehovah showed to the
Amalekites[**28**](#28.md); and the second way is utterly beyond thine
understanding, for it is the upright, and thou knowest nothing but the
averse, - until Wisdom shall inform thine Understanding, and upon the
base of the Ultimate triangle arise the smooth point[**29**](#29.md).

Veil therefore thine eyes, for that thou canst not master the Aethyr,
unless thy Mystery match Its Mystery. Seal up thy mouth also, for thou
canst not master the voice of the Aethyr, save only by Silence.

And thou shalt give the sign of the Mother, for BABALON is thy fortress
against the iniquity of the Abyss, for the iniquity of that which
bindeth her unto the Crown[**30**](#30.md), and barreth her from the Crown;
for not until thou art made one with CHAOS[**31**](#31.md) canst thou begin
that last, that most terrible projection, the three-fold Regimen which
alone constitutes the Great Work.

For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excrement of these three paths,
and therefore is his head raised unto Dath, and therefore have the Black
Brotherhood declared him to be the child of Wisdom and Understanding,
who is but the bastard of the Svastika. And this is that which is
written in the Holy Qabalah, concerning the Whirlpool and Leviathan, and
the Great Stone[**32**](#32.md).

Thus long have I talked with thee in bidding thee depart, that the
memory of the Aethyr might be dulled; for hadst thou come back suddenly
into thy mortal frame, thou hadst fallen into madness or death. For the
vision is not such that any may endure it.

But now thy sense is dull, and the shew-stone but a stone. Therefore
awake, and give secretly and apart the sign of the Mother, and call four
times upon the name of CHAOS[**33**](#33.md), that is the four-fold word
that is equal to her seven-fold word. And then shalt thou purify
thyself, and return into the World.

So I did that which was commanded me, and returned.

Biskra.

1.  <span id="1"></span>The last three Aethyrs are so tremendously
    sublime that comment is only too likely to mar the effect upon the
    reader. They must be read as masterpieces of Art, and their full
    magical import apprehended as such. This remark, indeed applies to
    the whole series, though not so formidably. The proper way is first
    to study the book in detail, so as to assimilate perfectly its
    intellectual content, and then to read it (so to say) ceremonially.
2.  <span id="2"></span>ZON. {Leo}{Libra}{Scorpio} The Sun, the Balance,
    and the Snake. See text of Aire.
3.  <span id="3"></span>Cf. the doctrine of the Snake Ananta.
4.  <span id="4"></span>The letters of Judgment, those that have a final
    form, {HEB:Mem} {HEB:Koph} {HEB:Nun} {HEB:Peh} {HEB:Tzaddi}, all add
    to 280.
5.  <span id="5"></span>{HEB:Resh}, {HEB:Lamed} and {HEB:Nun} ({Sun},
    {Libra} and {Scorpio}), the Sun, the Balance or plumes of Maat, and
    the Snake. Added they make 280.
6.  <span id="6"></span>Note this. If the Seer had seen this vision
    truly, he should have become a Magus right then. The vision
    following was really a Guard to the Aethyr.
7.  <span id="7"></span>Beth, an house.
8.  <span id="8"></span>The letter Aleph.

    note."
13. <span id="13"></span>She seeks to resist Change, which is Life, she
    refuses the Formula, "love under will." Yet
    {GRK:Mu}{GRK:Alpha}{GRK:Rho}{GRK:Iota} {GRK:Epsilon} (Greek) = 156.
14. <span id="14"></span>She is Binah, ruled by the path of Beth.
15. <span id="15"></span>Meaning, to construct a true Tree, of which
    Dath should be the summit. This is in fact the great error of the
    rationalists - both in science, like Bchner, and in religion, like
    Buddha. Knowledge is not, and cannot be, the crown of Consciousness,
    if only because the Logic beyond the Abyss convicts it of essential
    self contradiction. Dath, as seen by the Magister Templi, is so far
    from being the opposite of Ignorance that it is actually a
    demonstration that the Intellect is incapable of Truth.
16. <span id="16"></span>Aleph is incapacity to apprehend --- the
    absence of any steady truth. ({HEB:Aleph} = {Air}, the volatile).
    Beth is the assertion of false relations, even in the illusion of
    the dyad. ({HEB:Bet} = {Mercury}) And Gimel is the clouding of
    aspiration by the marsh miasma of desire ({HEB:Gemel} = {Moon}).
    Such are the evil and averse counterparts of the three highest
    faculties of the Soul: Aleph, the inspiration of the soul in
    ecstasy; Beth, the virtue of Truthfulness without care of other
    issues; and Gimel, the direct link of the human with the divine
    Consciousness.
17. <span id="17"></span>The Seer was being warned all the time that he
    was seeing only a Guard.
18. <span id="18"></span>Atu I. This is Mayan, the Great Magician, he
    who has created the Dyad ({HEB:Bet} = 2) and thus made possible the
    conception of Opposition, and hence of "Evil". He is to be
    distinguished from Chokma, the creative Mercury who transmits the
    Essence of Kether as a Logos, that Kether may become intelligible to
    Himself through Binah. This lower Mercury asserts the Dyad as
    Reality, and denies alike Kether and the Ain. Hence its issue is in
    Materialism.
19. <span id="19"></span>i.e., that the circle should be profaned. The
    evil circle is of three concentric rings. The circle demands the
    square (or Cross) to fulfill it.
20. <span id="20"></span>Curiously, for his retirement in New Hampshire
    (An XII) the Seer bought an axe, knife, and a saw for his magical
    weapons. He had completely forgotten this passage. P.S. ({Sun} in
    {Leo}, {Moon} in {Cancer}) (An XII) I have just realized (after some
    days woodcarving) that the use of a knife is to fashion shapeless
    things into Beauty. This is then the task of a Magus which, in my
    then Grade, I could not see. Now, O Lord, let me behold the true
    Vision of the Magus as he is.
21. <span id="21"></span>42 = 2 x 21. 21 =
    {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph}, God-name of Kether; thus 42
    asserts the Dyad as against the Monad, and denies Love. 42 =
    {HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Mem} {HEB:Aleph}, the Mother unfertilized, the
    Virgin-on-principle -- the feminine equivalent of the Black
    Brothers.
22. <span
    id="22"></span>{HEB:Taw}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Lamed}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Lamed} =
    480 = {HEB:Taw} {HEB:Yod} {HEB:Ayin} = Malkuth, of the 42-fold name
    in Yetzirah. Also 480 ={HEB:Taw} {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Ayin} {HEB:Dalet},
    Dath, in the Plural. Lilith is etymologically "The Woman of Night";
    but is diversely described by different authorities. To one she is,
    "from the head to the navel, a woman --- from the navel to the feet
    of her, a man". To another, "lovely shape that concealeth a black
    monkey, even as a figure that draweth with her hands small images of
    men down into hell" (*Liber Ararita* II, 10). She is also the "first
    wife of Adam" i.e. the succubus who visits in their sleep those boys
    and men who have not previously purified themselves by Right Coitus.
    The whole world of demons was in fact created (according to
    Rabbinical tradition) by the nocturnal pollutions of Adam. This is a
    true parable. For every sexual act produces its natural effect on
    all planes. All forms of spiritual experience may be obtained in
    this manner, according to the Magical Knowledge and Skill of the
    Operator. And there is always a Child begotten on some plane or
    other, as the conditions of the experiment decide. (Note. --- A.C.
    added the following here in his copy of *Eqx*. I, No. 5. "Doris
    Gomez who came just before Jeanne Foster. It's a perfect description
    of her normal nature. Add Laura Brown for the sake of completeness.
    What about Alostrael?")
23. <span id="23"></span>The Seer was physically overwhelmed by the
    horror of this experience. It may seem surprising that such
    phenomena should occur above the Abyss. But this Lilith is a
    positive form created by the Magus; whereas, Choronzon is the
    breaking-up of all coherence. Here also is a mystery of mysteries.
    Lilith is truly Babalon, as imagined by this energy of Mayan.
24. <span id="24"></span>LIL.
25. <span id="25"></span>For the Christian, obsessed by Mayan, sees Love
    in this obscene form. It is all a matter of the point-of-view.
26. <span id="26"></span>This is the Sigil of Binah in one of Her forms.
    It instantly destroys the illusion of Lilith, who now appears in her
    true shape as an avatar; a corporeal imagine of BABALON, recalling
    the maiden of the 9th Aethyr. (Note. --- in A.C.'s *Eqx*. here to
    the para. beginning "I have seen some picture" he notes in the
    margin "Hilarion, Jeanne Robert Foster". --- To the para. beginning
    "then the disk of the sun", he notes "Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy. She
    has Libra rising and Sol in Scorpio and she is mad about green." ---
    To the para. beginning "There is another girl", he notes "Helen
    Westley? - or Myriam Deroxe.")
27. <span id="27"></span>It would be improper in this place to comment
    upon these prophecies. The student may seek enlightenment in "The
    Urn".
28. <span id="28"></span>An XII. Now I understand. It's the fashioning I
    missed. All my life I have been cutting to destroy. Now I'll cut to
    create.
29. <span id="29"></span>All this passage is typical of the supernal
    Logic.
30. <span id="30"></span>The path of Beth.
31. <span id="31"></span>The mystery of CHAOS is beyond the
    comprehension of any but Masters of the Temple. One can only hint
    that this is at once the Formula of the Feminine Trinity and of the
    All-Father.
32. <span id="32"></span>The student is advised to study these matters
    in the original documents.
33. <span id="33"></span>{HEB:Samekh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Ayin}{HEB:Koph}
    = 156.
