**The Cry of the 23rd Aethyr,  
Which is Called TOR**[**1**](#1)**.**

In the brightness of the stone are three lights, brighter than all,
which revolve ceaselessly[**2**](#2). And now there is a spider's web of
silver[**3**](#3) covering the whole of the stone. Behind the spider's
web is a star of twelve rays[**4**](#4); and behind that again, a black
bull, furiously pawing up the ground. The flames from his mouth increase
and whirl, and he cries: Behold the mystery of toil, O thou who art
taken in the toils of mystery[**5**](#5). For I who trample the earth
thereby make whirlpools in the air; be comforted, therefore, for though
I be black, in the roof of my mouth is the sign of the
Beetle[**6**](#6). Bent are the backs of my brethren, yet shall they
gore the lion with their horns. Have I not the wings of the eagle, and
the face of the man?

And now he is turned into one of those winged Assyrian bull-men.

And he sayeth: The spade of the husbandman is the sceptre of the
king[**7**](#7). All the heavens beneath me, they serve me. They are my
fields and my gardens and my orchards and my pastures.

Glory be unto thee, who didst set thy feet in the North[**8**](#8);
whose forehead is pierced with the sharp points of the diamonds in thy
crown [**9**](#9); whose heart is pierced with the spear of thine own
fecundity [**10**](#10).

Thou art an egg of blackness, and a worm of poison. But thou hast
formulated thy father, and made fertile thy mother.

Thou art the basilisk whose gaze turns men to stone, and the cockatrice
at the breast of an harlot that giveth death for milk. Thou art the asp
that has stolen into the cradle of the babe. Glory unto thee, who art
twined about the world as the vine that clingeth to the bare body of a
bacchanal[**11**](#11).

Also, though I be planted so firmly upon the earth, yet is my blood wine
and my breath fire of madness. With these wings, though they be but
little, I lift myself above the crown of the yod[**12**](#12), and being
without fins I yet swim in the inviolate fountain[**13**](#13).

I disport myself in the ruins of Eden, even as Leviathan in the false
sea[**14**](#14), being whole as the rose at the crown of the
cross[**15**](#15). Come ye unto me, my children, and be glad. At the
end of labour is the power of labour[**16**](#16). And in my stability
is concentrated eternal change[**17**](#17).

For the whirlings of the universe are but the course of the blood in my
heart. And the unspeakable variety thereof is but my divers hairs, and
plumes, and gems in my tall crown. The change which ye lament is the
life of my rejoicing, and the sorrow that blackeneth your hearts is the
myriad deaths by which I am renewed.

And the instability which maketh ye to fear, is the little waverings of
balance by which I am assured[**18**](#18). And now the veil of silver
tissue-stuff closes over him, and above that, a purple veil, and above
that, a golden veil, so that now the whole stone is like a thick mat of
woven gold wires; and there come forth, one from each side of the stone,
two women, and grasp each other by both hands, and kiss, and melt into
one another; and melt away[**19**](#19). And now the veils open again,
the gold parts, and the purple parts, and the silver parts, and there is
a crowned eagle, also like the Assyrian eagles. And he cries: All my
strength and stability are turned to the use of flight[**20**](#20). For
though my wings are of fine gold, yet my heart is the heart of a
scorpion[**21**](#21). Glory unto thee, who being born in a stable didst
make thee mirth of the filth thereof, who didst suck in iniquity from
the breast of thy mother the harlot; who didst flood with iniquity the
bodies of thy concubines. Thou didst lie in the filth of the streets
with the dogs; thou wast tumbled and shameless and wanton in a place
where four roads meet. There wast thou defiled, and there wast thou
slain, and there wast thou left to rot. The charred stake was thrust
through thy bowels, and thy parts were cut off and thrust into thy mouth
for derision[**22**](#22). All my unity is dissolved; I live in the tips
of my feathers[**23**](#23). That which I think to be myself is but
infinite number[**24**](#24). Glory unto the Rose and the Cross, for the
Cross is extended unto the uttermost end beyond space and time and being
and knowledge and delight! Glory unto the Rose that is the minute point
of its center! Even as we say; glory unto the Rose that is Nuit the
circumference of all, and glory unto the Cross that is the heart of the
Rose[**25**](#25)!

Therefore do I cry aloud, and my scream is the treble as the bellowing
of the bull is the bass[**26**](#26). Peace in the highest and peace in
the lowest and peace in the midst thereof! Peace in the eight quarters,
peace in the ten points of the Pentagram! Peace in the twelve rays of
the seal of Solomon, and peace in the four and thirty whirlings of the
hammer of Thor[**27**](#27)! Behold! I blaze upon thee. (The eagle is
gone; it is only a flaming Rosy Cross of white brilliance.) I catch thee
up into rapture. FALUTLI, FALUTLI[**28**](#28)! ... O it dies, it dies.

Bou Sada. November 28, 1909. 9:30-10:15 A.M.

1.  <span id="1"></span>TOR = {Leo}{Libra}{Pisces}.
2.  <span id="2"></span>The Three Gunas, Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas. This is
    an Introit to the Aethyr. As we proceed, we find more and more
    obstacles to entering.
3.  <span id="3"></span>More introit; veils to the true Vision.
4.  <span id="4"></span>Tamas, Kerub of Earth. He and the Eagle of Air
    make up the 4 Officers of the New Temple.
5.  <span id="5"></span>A warning to the Seer not to allow himself to
    ignore or despise the plain facts of life. Mysteries --- nay, even
    The Mysteries themselves! are apt to seduce the Aspirant. He becomes
    exalt (as the cold rational French, observing these errors, call
    him) instead of exalted.
6.  <span id="6"></span>The tradition of the Bull Apis. The Beetle is
    the Midnight Sun, the hidden hope of Earth.
7.  <span id="7"></span>The King rules by virtue of the labour of his
    people. Even {Taurus} Earth is necessary as the support of Heaven.
    Nuit is upheld by Shu, who stands on Seb. Neglect to understand this
    causes many "pure Mystics" to fall lamentably. They "go off their
    base" in the significant slang of common-sense folk.
8.  <span id="8"></span>The Bull is stationed in the North.
9.  <span id="9"></span>The Bull is sacred to Osiris. This refers to the
    Crown of Thorns.
10. <span id="10"></span>Again a reference to the Formula of Osiris. The
    Spear (Sacred Lance, Phallus) pierces the heart of the Dying God.
11. <span id="11"></span>These two paragraphs declare the identity of
    the Bull with his Zodiacal opposite, Scorpio.
12. <span id="12"></span>The Crown of Yod (as a path on the Tree) is
    Chesed. It leads thither from Tiphereth. The path of the Bull leads
    from Chokmah down to Chesed.
13. <span id="13"></span>Refers to the Symbol of the woman and the Bull.
    See 16th Aire.
14. <span id="14"></span>See Knorr von Rosenroth on the Qlipoth (the
    Shells). He wrote *Kaballa Denudata* in Latin which was translated
    into English as *The Kaballah Unveiled* by McGregor Mathers, one of
    the Chiefs of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn
15. <span id="15"></span>"The Rose of Earth" surmounts the Cross of Fire
    in the symbol of Venus.
16. <span id="16"></span>Toil creates kinetic energy.
17. <span id="17"></span>See 11th Aire.
18. <span id="18"></span>All this paragraph explains this doctrine of
    Stability = Change. (Yesod, Support of the Tree, is also {Air} &
    {Moon}).
19. <span id="19"></span>These are intended to show symbolically that
    the Bull is the same as the Eagle.
20. <span id="20"></span>This transformation into Air shows the identity
    (in ultimate philosophy) of the two forces of change which
    constitute the Lesser Mysteries of the Sword and the Disk.
21. <span id="21"></span>Refers to the Scorpion in the Symbol of the
    Bull of Mithras.
22. <span id="22"></span>These two paragraphs refer to the Formula of
    the Dying God, its perversion and profanation at the hands of those
    who abused it.
23. <span id="23"></span>Air has a peripheral consciousness.
24. <span id="24"></span>The True Unity does not exist in any particular
    number, but in {HEB:Aleph}x as a whole.
25. <span id="25"></span>The Rose and Cross are not merely symbols of
    definite types of energy, female and male. They are extended in the
    correlative symbols of Infinity: Nuit and Hadit.
26. <span id="26"></span>Air and Earth are harmonious vibrations,
    complementary.
27. <span id="27"></span>The vibrations of Tetragrammaton, Jeheshua, the
    Hexagram, and the Swastika are Swastika re duplicated, being
    complete in each of the two Series, Air and Earth, the lower forms
    of Masculine and Feminine.
28. <span id="28"></span>See *Liber VII*, Cap. V, v. 30. It is the cry
    of the consummated rapture of the Dissolution of any symbol by
    virtue of Love. FAL is Aleph (AFL, thick darkness; PLA, the Hidden
    Wonder, a title of Kether.) The whole symbolism of Aleph, 111, must
    be studied thoroughly. It is especially the equations: One = Zero;
    and Three = One. Aleph is Iacchus, Lord of Ecstasy; Harpocrates,
    Lord of Silence: Zeus Arrhenotheleus; Bacchus Diphues, Baphomet,
    etc. Lord of the Two-in-One Love; Parsifal, The Pure Fool, the
    Wandering Spirit of God, who impregnates the King's Daughter. UT is
    the title of the Holy Guardian Angel in the Upanishads. C.q.v. also
    the poem of "UT" in "The Winged Beetle". LI is the Hebrew for "to
    me". See AL I, v. 51, 53, 61, 62, 63. (L is Atu VIII = {HEB:Lamed} =
    the Satisfied Woman; I is {HEB:Yod}, Atu IX, the Hermit). See AL
    II, v. 24 --- The Hidden Virtue which satisfies Her.
    {GRK:Phi}{GRK:Alpha}{GRK:Lambda} {GRK:Upsilon}
    {GRK:Tau}{GRK:Lambda}{GRK: I ota} = 1271 = 2542/2. 2542 =
    {GRK:Theta} {GRK:epsilon} {GRK:lambda} {GRK:eta} {GRK:mu}
    {GRK:alpha} spelt in full.
