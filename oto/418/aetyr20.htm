<p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 20th Aethyr,<br>
  Which is Called KHR</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font
        size="6"> </font></p>
<p>The dew that was upon the face of the stone is gone, and it is become like 
  a pool of clear golden water. And now the light is come into the Rosy Cross. 
  Yet all that I see is the night, with the stars therein, as they appear through 
  a telescope<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. And there 
  cometh a peacock<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> into 
  the stone, filling the whole Aire. It is like the vision called the Universal 
  Peacock, or, rather, like a representation of that vision. And now there are 
  countless clouds of white angels<a href="#4"><font
        size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> filling the Aire as the peacock 
  dissolves. </p>
<p>Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets. These cause all things 
  to appear at once, so that there is a tremendous confusion of images. And now 
  I perceive that all these things are but veils of the wheel, for they all gather 
  themselves<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> into a wheel<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a> 
  that spins with incredible velocity. It hath many colours, but all thrilled 
  with white light, so that they are transparent and luminous. This one wheel 
  is forty-nine wheels, set at different angles, so that they compose a sphere; 
  each wheel has forty-nine spokes, and has forty-nine<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> 
  concentric tyres at equal distances from the centre. And wherever the rays from 
  any two wheels meet, there is a blinding flash of glory. It must be understood 
  that though so much detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time the 
  impression is of a single, simple object. </p>
<p>It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand<a
        href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. Though the wheel 
  fills the whole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel. And though 
  this vision is so great and splendid, yet there is no seriousness with it, or 
  solemnity. It seems that the hand is spinning the wheel merely for pleasure, 
  it would be better to say amusement. </p>
<p>A voice comes: For he is a jocund and a ruddy god, and his laughter is the 
  vibration of all that exists, and the earthquakes of the soul. </p>
<p>One is conscious of the whirring of the wheel thrilling one, like an electric 
  discharge passing through one. </p>
<p>Now I see the figures on the wheel, which have been interpreted as the sworded 
  Sphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon<a
        href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. And that is wrong. 
  The rim of the wheel is a vivid emerald snake; in the centre of the wheel is 
  a scarlet heart; and, impossible to explain as it is, the scarlet of the heart 
  and the green of the snake are yet more vivid than the blinding white brilliance 
  of the wheel<a
        href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>The figures on the wheel are darker than the wheel itself; in fact, they are 
  stains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and because of the 
  whirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top seems to be the Lamb 
  and Flag, such as one sees on some Christian medals, and one of the lower things 
  is a wolf, and the other a raven. The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter 
  than the other two. It keeps on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than 
  the wheel itself, and occupies more space than it did. </p>
<p>It speaks: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and innocence 
  shall seduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come to the centre 
  of the wheel<a
        href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. The wolf betrayeth 
  only the greedy and the treacherous; the raven betrayeth only the melancholy 
  and the dishonest <a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
  But I am he of whom it is written: He shall deceive the very elect. </p>
<p>For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spirits that they 
  might sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to the three 
  impure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven 
  for the lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all to simulate the pure 
  prompting of the soul<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
  Them that are fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven I have not scathed; but 
  them that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrath of the raven and 
  the wolf<a
        href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. And the jaws 
  of the one have torn them, and the beak of the other has devoured the corpse. 
  Therefore is my flag white, because I have left nothing upon the earth alive. 
  I have feasted myself on the blood of the saints, but I am not suspected of 
  men to be their enemy, for my fleece is white and warm, and my teeth are not 
  the teeth of one that teareth flesh; and mine eyes are mild, and they know me 
  not the chief of the lying spirits that the Father of all sent forth from before 
  his face in the beginning<a
        href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>(His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven sulphur<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>.) 
</p>
<p>Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel, and the 
  hand that whirleth it. </p>
<p>And I said: &quot;By the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; 
  by the word that is seven, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible word 
  210<a
        href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>, I beseech thee, 
  O my Lord, to grant me the vision of thy glory.&quot; And all the rays of the 
  wheel stream out at me, and I am blasted and blinded with the light. I am caught 
  up into the wheel. I am one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
  In the midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face. (I am thrown 
  violently back on to the earth every second, so that I cannot quite concentrate.) 
</p>
<p>All one gets is a liquid flame of pale gold. But its radiant force keeps hurling 
  me back. </p>
<p>And I say: By the word and the will, by the penance and the prayer, let me 
  behold thy face. (I cannot explain this, there is confusion of personalities.) 
  I who speak to you, see what I tell you; but I, who see him, cannot communicate 
  it to me, who speak to you<a href="#19"><font
        size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be like the substance of 
  him. But the light is without heat. It is the vision of Ut<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a> 
  in the Upanishads. And from this vision have come all the legends of Bacchus 
  and Krishna and Adonis<a href="#21"><font
        size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. For the impression is of a youth 
  dancing and making music. But you must understand that he is not doing that, 
  for he is still<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
  Even the hand that turns the wheel is not his hand, but only a hand energized 
  by him. </p>
<p>And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his victim<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
  My form is the form of the God Phtah<a href="#24"><font
        size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>, in my essence, but the form of 
  the god Seb in my form<a href="#25"><font
        size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. And this is the reason of existence, 
  that in this dance which is delight, there must needs be both the god and the 
  adept. Also the earth herself is a saint; and the sun and the moon dance upon 
  her, torturing her with delight. </p>
<p>This vision is not perfect. I am only in the outer court of the vision, because 
  I have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must retain sense and 
  speech<a
        href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. No recorded 
  vision is perfect, of high visions, for the seer must keep either his physical 
  organs or his memory in working order. And neither is capable. There is no bridge. 
  One can only be conscious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness moves 
  nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and mental. Even so, 
  the body and the mind must be very perfect before anything can be done, or the 
  energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and the mind into insanity. 
  This is why the first visions give Ananda, which is a shock. When the adept 
  is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace<a
        href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. </p>
<p>This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is I<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. 
  And therefore the human ego is being constantly excited, so that one comes back 
  so often. An acentric meditation practice like mahasatipatthana ought to be 
  done before invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, so that the ego may be very 
  ready to yield itself utterly to the Beloved. </p>
<p>And now the breeze is blowing about us, like the sighs of love unsatisfied 
  --- or satisfied. His lips move<a
        href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. I cannot say 
  the words at first. </p>
<p>And afterwords: &quot;Shalt thou not bring the children of men to the sight 
  of my glory<a href="#30"><font
        size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>? 'Only thy silence and thy speech 
  that worship me avail.' 'For as I am the last, so am I the next, and as the 
  next shalt thou reveal me to the multitude<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>.' 
  Fear not for aught; turn not aside for aught, eremite of Nuit, apostle of Hadit, 
  warrior of Ra Hoor Khu! The leaven taketh, and the bread shall be sweet; the 
  ferment worketh, and the wine shall be sweet. My sacraments are vigorous food 
  and divine madness. Come unto me, O ye children of men; come unto me, in whom 
  I am, in whom ye are, were ye only alive with the life that abideth in Light.&quot; 
</p>
<p>All this time I have been fading away. I sink. The veil of night comes down 
  a dull blue-gray with one pentagram in the midst of it, watery and dull. And 
  I am to abide there for a while before I come back to the earth<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. 
  (But shut me the window up, hide me from the sun. Oh, shut the window!)<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a> 
</p>
<p>Now, the pentagram is faded; black crosses fill the Aethyr gradually growing 
  and interlacing, until there is a network. </p>
<p>It is all dark now. I am lying exhausted<a href="#34"><font
        size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>, with the sharp edge of the shew-stone 
  cutting into my forehead. </p>
<p>Bou-Sada.<br>

  <li><a name="1"></a><font size="2">KHR = {Dee}{Air}{Gemini} = {HEB:Shin}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Vau} 
    = 308. (N.B. by Temurah, R.H.K. = Ra-Hoor-Khuit). 308 = 28 x 11. 28 = {HEB:Chet} 
    {HEB:Koph} = {Cancer}{Jupiter} (Jupiter is exalted in Cancer) means Power. 
    And 29 is the &quot;mystic number&quot; of Netzach, Victory, the Sephira that 
    hangs from the Sphere of Jupiter, by the path of Jupiter, Atu X, the Wheel 
    of Fortune. This Atu is the main subject of the vision in this Aethyr. In 
    this Aethyr the Solar Body (Ruach --- the human consciousness) of the Seer 
    was prepared for the Great Initiation which follows, as in the 27th Aire his 
    Lunar Body (Nephesch --- automatic Consciousness) was purified.</font></li>
  <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">These preliminary visions are veils.</font></li>
  <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">The bird sacred to Juno, the feminine counterpart 
    of Jupiter, whose Energy is about to appear.</font></li>
  <li><a name="4"></a><font size="2">The Chasmalim, &quot;The brilliant ones&quot;, 
    are the Chior of Angels which pertain to Jupiter.</font></li>
  <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">This unification is necessary to all true 
    comprehension. </font></li>
  <li><a name="6"></a><font size="2">The Wheel of Fortune (so called); Atu X is 
    the Wheel of the Samsara whose spokes are the Three Gunas, the three fundamental 
    Modes of Energy, Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas. See also <em>Book of Lies</em>, 
    Cap. 78. </font></li>
  <li><a name="7"></a><font size="2">The symbolism of the Table (see 22nd Aire) 
    still retains its prominence. 7 is the number of the Inferiors, of the Feminine 
    Perfection. 3 x 49 = 147 = {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Yod} + {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} 
    + {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Gemel}{HEB:Aleph} + {HEB:Yod}{HEB:Nun}{HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Aleph} 
    = the Four Names of god used in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Thus there 
    is here the symbolism of the Fourfold Regimen (Tetragrammaton) implied in 
    3 x 7 x 7.</font></li>
  <li><a name="8"></a><font size="2">Hand = {HEB:Yod} = {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod} 
    = 20 = K = 4. But also the first is itself K. There is, however, an esoteric 
    doctrine in this phrase. {HEB:Yod} is the spermatozoon, the source of all 
    Spiritual Energy, the Minute Point, Hadit, the foundation of the Alphabet, 
    (Hebrew). But also K = {HEB:Peh-final}{HEB:Koph} = 100 = 10 x 10 = {HEB:Yod} 
    x {HEB:Yod}; and K and P are the initials of Ketis and {GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha} 
    {GRK:lambda} {GRK:lambda}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} whose union releases {HEB:Yod}. 
    Thus the Universe is shown as being set in motion by Love under Will. See 
    <em>Book of Lies</em>, Cap. 43.</font></li>
  <li><a name="9"></a><font size="2">See the usual drawing of Atu X by minor initiates.</font></li>
  <li><a name="10"></a><font size="2">The symbolism here assumes the form of <em>Liber 
    LXV</em>. It is simpler and therefore more difficult than the sevenfold. The 
    counter charges become more frequent; the Seer is being led up to the state 
    in which opposites are not only equal, but identical. </font></li>
  <li><a name="11"></a><font size="2">All unbalanced symbols are necessarily evil. 
    They distract the attention from the true object of Vision, and so destroy 
    Concentration.</font></li>
  <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">Note that no hostile force is hurtful. The 
    enemy is always oneself.</font></li>
  <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">The attacks are against Nephesch, Ruach, 
    and Neshama respectively. </font></li>
  <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">When the aspiration (Neshama), the natural 
    protection against all lower forces, is sullied, befooled, or weakened, the 
    wretch becomes an easy prey to grosser forms of temptation. We see in fact 
    only too often that a man of the utmost probity and intellectual integrity, 
    who errs in some strictly spiritual matter, lose every trace of rationality, 
    and throw off all moral restraint, becoming the helpless victim of ludicrous 
    and hideous temptations which had never threatened him before in his whole 
    life. His nature is so radically corrupted that his friends believe him to 
    have become insane. But his fall is quite logical, as a tumbling steeple may 
    crush the perfectly sound structures beneath it.</font></li>
  <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">It is the superficial appeal of the idea 
    of &quot;Jesus&quot; to the sentimental type of aspiration (the vilest parody 
    of Neschamah is this pollution by the least virile elements of Nephesh) that 
    has made possible the corruption implied in the doctrines of Sin and Vicarious 
    Atonement. From this error have sprung the putrefaction of the reasoning faculties, 
    and the suppression of all clear thinking, and the abominations of greed, 
    persecution and the rest. </font></li>
  <li><a name="16"></a><font size="2">{Salt} for Neschamah; {Mercury} for Ruach; 
    {Sulphur} for Nephesch.</font></li>
  <li><a name="17"></a><font size="2">N.O.X. = {HEB:Tzaddi}{HEB:Ayin}{HEB:Nun} 
    = 210. {Earth} represents the reduction of the Dyad to Unity by Love under 
    Will, and thence to 0 by dissolution in Nuit. It is here used by the Seer 
    to destroy all positive symbols, for the true Wheel (apart from ornaments) 
    is the circle, Nuit Herself.</font></li>
  <li><a name="18"></a><font size="2">Note the above-the-Abyss-consciousness. 
    Cf. &quot;I who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord.&quot; (Bhagavad 
    Gita)</font></li>
  <li><a name="19"></a><font size="2">This personality-paradox is characteristic 
    of visions of similar exaltation. It constitutes an essential difficulty of 
    expression superadded to that natural to the description of things seen and 
    heard, which are yet not subject to the ordinary Laws of perception.</font></li>
  <li><a name="20"></a><font size="2">See previous note on Falutli.</font></li>
  <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">These are Solar, not Jupiterian deities. 
    The Jupiter of the Wheel is that Invisible Energy, whom one can only divine 
    from his Hand, his means of Expression. He is Amoun, the Concealed One, whose 
    plumes are Truth, and whose Phallus is the Middle Pillar, the Shivalingam. 
    We hind accordingly that these Solar Deities, who spring from the manifested 
    Jupiter (as it at first sight appears) are soon recognized in their deeper 
    nature. </font></li>
  <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">Change = Stability. 2x = 9{square x}. See 
    the 11th Aethyr. Again this series of paradoxes (implied in the equations 
    0x = 0{square x}, 1x = 10{squarex}, etc.) is of the essence of the Aire.</font></li>
  <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">See any true Image of Shiva, who dances 
    upon the Yogi, whom he has destroyed in the Union of Love.</font></li>
  <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">Phtah, the still and silent Creative Energy.</font></li>
  <li><a name="25"></a><font size="2">That is, the form of the Seer is now the 
    Earth itself, the Malkuth at the other end of the scale from, yet identical 
    with, His Kether.</font></li>
  <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">See note 5, page 44. Any vision as exalted 
    as this must obviously be indicible. The plastic form of the expression, the 
    definite character of the shapes, colours, and numbers employed, is far better 
    mnemonically than the vaguely beatific outbursts customary in the records 
    usually offered by Mystics.</font></li>
  <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">The psychology of the previous note explained 
    at length. </font></li>
  <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">In previous visions the Angel of the Aethyr 
    has always been peculiar to his Aire. Even in ZAA, where the Angel is Luna, 
    and the Vision represents the lustration of the Lunar Body (the Automatic 
    Consciousness) of the Seer, He was not so wholly involved. For his normal 
    consciousness was above that which the Aethyr affected. </font></li>
  <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">It seems that the seer recognized in this 
    Aethyr, the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel.</font></li>
  <li><a name="30"></a><font size="2">In the Crossing of the Abyss by the Seer 
    (&quot;The Temple Of Solomon the King&quot;, <em>Equinox</em> I, No. Viii, 
    pp. 9-13) during his Burma-China journey, he accomplished the meditation called 
    Sammasati. He became aware of his True Will, of the purpose for which he had 
    undertaken Incarnation. And this was expressed thus: to aid Mankind to take 
    the Next Step. And at the time he understood this as meaning: to lead them 
    to aspire to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</font></li>
  <li><a name="31"></a><font size="2"><em>Liber LXV</em> describes this attainment 
    in the fullest detail. The first quotation is from <em>Liber VII</em>, Cap. 
    VI, verse 35. The second is from <em>Liber LXV</em>, Chapter III, v. 62. (The 
    persons are transposed --- &quot;I&quot; to &quot;Thou&quot;, etc.)</font></li>
  <li><a name="32"></a><font size="2">The splendour of the Vision would have made 
    too rapid a return a shock intolerable to human weakness.</font></li>
  <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">It was done. --- O.V.</font></li>
  <li><a name="34"></a><font size="2">The Seer had not previously experienced 
    so intense a Communion and had contributed his physical energy to maintain 
    it. This was, of course, an error.</font></li>
