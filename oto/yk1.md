    KHIEN Originating from the term, piercing
    advantageous, right and firm.


    The dragon lurks: it is no time to act.
    The dragon's in the field: now make thy pact.
    Be active, watchful, using care and tact.
    The dragon leaps; a bursting cataract.
    The dragon ploughs the sky with pace exact.
    Exceed not, dragon; Lest thy force react.

    (If all this heavenly hosts of dragons lacked
    their heads, good fortune would become a fact.)

    KHWAN: Great, originating, right and fair,
    piercing and helpful, firm as in the mare.
    If the true man should move, his feet will stray;
    for him to follow is his proper way.


    Hoar-frost! The strong one cometh by and by.
    Straight, square and great, advantage springs to aye.
    Maintain, but boast not virtue's majesty.
    Here is a sack made safe by skillful tie.
    Behold the yellow skirt; ill fortune fly.
    Dragons at war: Gold, blood and porphyry.


    (Correct and firm the conduct, thou shalt spy
    good fortune from the sky.)

    and vantage from appointing feudal princes.


    Hard mere advance, maintain thy place correct.
    Distress, retreat; fear not, a friend is nigh.
    Lost in the wood, seek not a deer to espy.

    O'ermatched, the study of heaven's law perpend.
    Now with great fortune on thy side contend!
    Victorious, the fruit's bitter in the end.

    Mark well the rules of martial strategy.
    Chief of the host, thy king confers the post.

    There's one beyond thyself that yearns for thee.
    Base well thy tower upon the people's power.

    Level and easy walks the anchorite.

    good fortune, small things gone, and great things come.


    Pull up one stalk; and others follow it.
    Seek patience, self reliance, love and wit.
    Though all things change, rejoice; for that is writ.
    Call friends to help thee, they may bring thee through.

    Restoring all things, murmur, We may blunder.
    The darkness passes; light breaks forth from under.

    In all ways heaven's blessing hath overflowed!
