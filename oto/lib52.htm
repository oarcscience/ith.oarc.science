<h1 align="center">Manifesto of the O.T.O.</h1>
<h2 align="center">Issued by Order:</h2>
<h2 align="center">BAPHOMET XI° O.T.O.,<br>
  HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM,<br>
  REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS</h2>
<p align="center">Peace, Tolerance, Truth; <br>
  Salutation on All Points of the Triangle; <br>
  Respect To the Order. </p>
<p align="center">To All Whom It May Concern: Greeting and Health.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</strong> 
</p>
<p>1. The O.T.O. is a body of initiates in whose hands are concentrated the wisdom 
  and the knowledge of the following bodies:<br>
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
  <li>The Gnostic Catholic Church. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Knights of the Holy Ghost. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Illuminati. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Temple (Knights Templar). </li>
  <li>The Order of the Knights of St. John. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Knights of Malta. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre. </li>
  <li>The Hidden Church of the Holy Graal. </li>
  <li>The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. </li>
  <li>The Holy Order of Rose Croix of Heredom. </li>
  <li type="1">The Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch. </li>
  <li>The Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry (33 degrees). </li>
  <li>The Rite of Memphis (97 degrees). </li>
  <li>The Rite of Mizraim (90 degrees). </li>
  <li>The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry (33 degrees). </li>
  <li>The Swedenborgian Rite of Masonry. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Martinists. </li>
  <li>The Order of the Sat Bhai, and many other orders of equal merit, if of less 
    fame. </li>
</ol>
<p>It does not include the A.·.A.·., with which august body it is, however, in 
  close alliance.</p>
<p>It does not in any way infringe the just privileges of duly authorized Masonic 
  Bodies.</p>
<p>2. The dispersion of the original secret wisdom having led to confusion, it 
  was determined by the Chiefs of all these Orders to recombine and centralize 
  their activities, even as white light, divided in a prism, may be recomposed.</p>
<p>It embodies the whole of the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders; and its 
  chiefs are initiates of the highest rank, and recognized as such by all capable 
  of such recognition in every country in the world.</p>
<p>In more remote times, the constituent originating assemblies of the O.T.O. 
  included such men as:</p>

<p>The names of women members are never divulged.</p>
<p>It is not lawful here to disclose the name of any living chief.</p>
<p>It was Karl Kellner who revived the exoteric organization of the O.T.O. and 
  initiated the plan now happily complete of bringing all occult bodies again 
  under one governance.</p>
<p>The letters O.T.O. represent the words Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of the Temple 
  of the Orient, or Oriental Templars), but they have also a secret meaning for 
  initiates.</p>
<p>3. The Order is international, and has existing branches in every civilized 
  country of the world.</p>
<p>4. The aims of the O.T.O. can only be understood fully by its highest initiates; 
  but it may be said openly that it teaches Hermetic Science or Occult Knowledge, 
  the Pure and Holy Magick of Light, the Secrets of Mystic attainment, Yoga of 
  all forms, Gnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakta Yoga and Hatha Yoga, and all other 
  branches of the secret Wisdom of the Ancients.</p>
<p>In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries; its brain has resolved all the problems 
  of philosophy and of life.</p>
<p>It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of Immortality, 
  and of the Universal Medicine.</p>
<p>Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world-old dream of 
  the Brotherhood of Man.</p>
<p>It also possesses in every important centre of poÿulation a hidden Retreat 
  (<em>Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum</em>) where members may conceal themselves 
  in order to pursue the Great Work without hindrance.</p>
<p>These houses are secret fortresses of Truth, Light, Power and Love, and their 
  position is only disclosed under an oath of secrecy to those entitled to make 
  use of them.</p>
<p>They are also temples of true worship, specially consecrated by Nature to bring 
  out of a man all that is best in him.</p>
<p>5. The authority of the O.T.O. is concentrated in the O.H.O. (Outer Head of 
  the Order), or Frater Superior. The name of the person occupying this office 
  is never disclosed except to his immediate representatives.</p>
<p>6. The Authority of the O.H.O. in all English-speaking countries is delegated 
  by charter to the Most Holy, Most Illustrious, Most Illuminated, and Most Puissant 
  Baphomet X° Rex Summus Sanctissimus 33°, 90°, 96°, Past Grand Master of the 
  United States of America, Grand Master of Ireland, Iona, and All the Britains, 
  Grand Master of the Knights of the Holy Ghost, Sovereign Grand Commander of 
  the Order of the Temple, Most Wise Sovereign of the Order of the Rosy Cross, 
  Grand Zerubbabel of the Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch, etc. etc. etc., 
  National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em> of the O.T.O.</p>
<p>7. The National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em> is assisted by two principal 
  officers, the Grand Treasurer General and the Grand Secretary General.</p>
<p>There are many other officers, but they do not concern those to whom the present 
  manifesto is addressed.</p>
<p>8. The whole of the Knowledge dispersed among the bodies mentioned in paragraph 
  2 has been sifted and concentrated in the following degrees. </p>

<p>9. Every man and woman that is of full age, free, and of good report, has an 
  indefeasible right to the III°.</p>
<p>Beyond this, admission is only granted by invitation from the governing body 
  concerned.</p>
<p>The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body so far as 
  the 'secrets' are concerned in the sense in which that expression is usually 
  understood; and therefore in no way conflicts with, or infringes the just privileges 
  of, the United Grand Lodge of England, or any Grand Lodge in America or elsewhere 
  which is recognized by it.</p>
<p>10. Application for admission to the Order may be made personally at headquarters, 
  between the hours of Ten A.M. and Twelve Noon on week-days, or by letter to 
  the Grand Secretary General. In the former case, applicants should be provided 
  with the Twenty Dollars entitling them to the Third Degree; in the latter, it 
  should be enclosed with the application.</p>
<p>The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third Degree; if this 
  is taken after June 30 in any year, only half the amount is due.</p>
<p>Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but the Brother is considered 
  in good standing, and he does not lose his rights, if it is paid by March 1. 
  Should he fail to discharge his obligation by this date, he ceases <em>ipso 
  facto</em> to be a member of the Order, but may be reinstated on paying arrears 
  and Five Dollars extra. If his lapse extend to the next year following, he can 
  only be reinstated under special conditions, and by the express consent in writing 
  of the National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em>.</p>
<p>11. The Constitution, Trust Deeds, Charters, Warrants and all other documents, 
  are exhibited to candidates on their exaltation to the IV°, should they desire 
  it.</p>
<p>12. Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas for framing 
  are granted to all members at a uniform price of Ten Dollars. Special diplomas 
  of the IX°, Twenty-five Dollars.</p>
<p>13. The privileges of members of the O.T.O. are very numerous. These are the 
  principal: </p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
  <li>They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole body of hidden 
    knowledge preserved in the Sanctuary from the beginning of its manifestation.
    <p>In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted and conveyed in symbol, 
      beneath veil, and through sacrament.</p>
    <p>In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so that 
      he who well uses the knowledge of the lower grades may be selected for invitation 
      to the higher, where all things are declared openly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in Liberty, Beauty, 
    Harmony, and Love which flames within the heart of the O.T.O., and the Light 
    of that august fraternity insensibly illuminates them ever more and more as 
    they approach its central Sun.</li>
  <li>They meet those persons most complemental to their own natures, and find 
    unexpected help and brotherhood in the whole world wherever they may travel.</li>
  <li>They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the O.T.O., permanently 
    or for a greater or lesser period of the year according to their rank in the 
    Order; or, in the case of those of the Fifth and lower degrees, are candidates 
    for invitation to these houses.</li>
  <li>The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine is restricted 
    to members of the IX°; but it may be administered to members of the VIII° 
    and VII° in special circumstances by favour of the National Grand Masters 
    General, and even in particular emergency to members of lower degrees.</li>
  <li>In the V° all members are pledged to bring immediate and perfect relief 
    to all distress of mind, body, or estate, in which they may find any of their 
    fellows of that degree. In the higher degrees the Bonds of Fraternity are 
    still further strengthened. The Order thus affords a perfect system of insurance 
    against every misfortune or accident of life.</li>
  <li>Members of the IX° become part proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the 
    Order, so that the attainment of this degree implies a return with interest 
    of the fees and subscriptions paid.</li>
  <li>The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy members of even its 
    lower degrees, so that, even if originally poor, they become well able to 
    afford the comparatively high fees of the VII°, VIII°, and IX°. On exaltation 
    to the IV° each Companion may file an account of his circumstances, and state 
    in what direction he requires help. </li>
</ol>
<p>14. In selecting members for advancement, attention is paid to their devotion 
  to the Order, to their intelligence in apprehending the nature of its teaching, 
  to their zeal in spreading the principles of the Order so far as they themselves 
  understand them, though always with the discretion inseparable from the due 
  guarding of the secrets, and to all those qualities of courage, honour, and 
  virtue without which man is not worthy of that name.</p>
<p>15. The O.H.O. is only known to members of the VIII° and IX°.</p>
<p>The National Grand Master General ad vitam is not approachable as such by any 
  person who has not reached the VI°.</p>
<p>All communications should be addressed to the Grand Secretary General, and 
  all cheques drawn in favour of the Grand Treasurer General.</p>
