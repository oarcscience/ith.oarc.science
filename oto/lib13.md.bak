51\. Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers. The
foundations of the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did
the king weep at dawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried
in the distant land?

52\. There was also an humming-bird that spake unto the horned cerastes,
and prayed him for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the
royal Uræus serpent, answered him and said:

53\. I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years,
and I saw not any creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of
my fang is the inheritance of my father, and of my father's father; and
how shall I give it unto thee? Live thou and thy children as I and my
fathers have lived, even unto an hundred millions of generations, and it
may be that the mercy of the Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a
drop of the poison of eld.

54\. Then the humming-bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto
the flowers, and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet
in a little while a serpent struck him that he died.

55\. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god
listened and heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a
serpent, saying Peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of
generations of my children, they shall attain to a drop of the poison of
the fang of the Exalted One.

56\. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Uræus serpent,
and the poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for
ever and for ever.

Further, he is given two meditation-practices corresponding to the two

acquaintance with, these meditations. The complete results, if attained,
would confer a much higher grade.)

At last, Ritual VIII admits him to the grade of Adeptus Minor.

6\. *The Adeptus Minor*. His duty is laid down in Paper F, Class D.

It is to follow out the instruction given in the Vision of the Eighth
Aethyr for the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy
Guardian Angel.

\[NOTE. This is in truth the sole task; the others are useful only as
adjuvants to and preparations for the One Work.

Moreover, once this task has been accomplished, there is no more need of
human help or instruction; for by this alone may the highest attainment
be reached.

All these grades are indeed but convenient landmarks, not necessarily
significant. A person who had attained them all might be immeasurably
the inferior of one who had attained none of them; it is Spiritual
Experience alone that counts in Result; the rest is but Method.

Yet it is important to possess knowledge and power, provided that it be
devoted wholly to that One Work.\]
