KHIEN Originating from the term, piercing
advantageous, right and firm.


The dragon lurks: it is no time to act.
The dragon's in the field: now make thy pact.
Be active, watchful, using care and tact.
The dragon leaps; a bursting cataract.
The dragon ploughs the sky with pace exact.
Exceed not, dragon; Lest thy force react.

(If all this heavenly hosts of dragons lacked
their heads, good fortune would become a fact.)

KHWAN: Great, originating, right and fair,
piercing and helpful, firm as in the mare.
If the true man should move, his feet will stray;
for him to follow is his proper way.


Hoar-frost! The strong one cometh by and by.
Straight, square and great, advantage springs to aye.
Maintain, but boast not virtue's majesty.
Here is a sack made safe by skillful tie.
Behold the yellow skirt; ill fortune fly.
Dragons at war: Gold, blood and porphyry.


(Correct and firm the conduct, thou shalt spy
good fortune from the sky.)

Hard mere advance, maintain thy place correct.
Distress, retreat; fear not, a friend is nigh.
Lost in the wood, seek not a deer to espy.
Retreating, seek thy mate; with him, aim high.
Dispense rich favors as thy friends expect.
Thine house bolt; bleed tears of agony!

Still wait, at festival - Oh firmly stand.
Three guests come helping; greet them courteously.

LI: Is the treading of the path that's right!
Step on the tiger's tail; he will not bite.


Follow the path of thine accustomed right;
Level and easy walks the anchorite.

Firm, resolute - yet perilous thy plight;
Examine well, the augury of the flight.

THAI: The due order of things; we see, in sum,
good fortune, small things gone, and great things come.


Pull up one stalk; and others follow it.
Seek patience, self reliance, love and wit.
Though all things change, rejoice; for that is writ.
Call friends to help thee, they may bring thee through.
Remember what Ti Yi thought right and true.
The city's fallen; there's little thou canst do.

The darkness passes; light breaks forth from under.

Through tears to laughter, victory crowns thy state.
Even in the suburbs men proclaim thee great.

within whose cauldron bubbles up succes.


Steer clear of wrong, envision clear thy road.

Sincerity is matched bu majesty.
In all ways heaven's blessing hath overflowed!

Thus all thy neighbors in thy cause array.
Use force - but only on the proper prey!

Be firm, with foresight all thy soul aglow.
Presume not; understand - what came may go!
Shed happiness, call friends to share success!
Make not a habit; joy's as dull as woe.
Oh! Think more deeply; change is wisdom's throw!</pre>
