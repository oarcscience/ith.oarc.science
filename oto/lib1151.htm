    <p>Knock: 333 - 55555 - 333 (total 11 knocks) </p>
    <p>&quot;Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.&quot; </p>
    <p>** What is thy will? </p>
    <p>It is my will to eat and drink. </p>
    <p>** To what end? </p>
    <p>That my body may be fortified thereby. </p>
    <p>** To what end? </p>
    <p>That I may accomplish the Great Work. </p>
