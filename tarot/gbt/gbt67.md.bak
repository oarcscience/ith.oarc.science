#### Nine of Cups

TRADITION: Victory, success, advantage, gain, triumph, superiority, etc.
"The heart's content." (*W*.) Reversed, the card seems even better:
Sincerity, truth, loyalty, good faith, frankness, ingenuity, opening the
heart, liberty, familiarity, etc. Concord, contentment, physical
well-being.

THEORY: Many of the addictions are very suggestive of the influence of
the *Water* on the house of the heart, *the Fifth*; and we can only say,
that they are fairly exact and to the point. The card must signify the
realisation of hopes and wishes lying in one's own power or destiny,
making one enjoy the fulness of life, and adopting the philosophy of
Epicurus. There is no evil in it. It shows goodness and a jovial
disposition, not only contentment and happiness in one's self, but also,
owing to Leo-influence, the love of bestowing hospitality on other
people and helping them.

CONCLUSION: *Happiness, contentment, the fulfilment of wishes, bestowing
benefits, hospitality, the heart's content,' loyalty, liberality, the
joy of life, love of children; concord, well-being; success, advantage,
satisfaction, etc. Joviality*.

P.S.--In the more profane branch of divination this card is called the
'*nine-months-card*,' owing to the belief that it means *pregnancy and
expectance of childbirth*. The latter is significant of the fifth house,

the former confirms our idea, that the cups have to do with months in
time.
