#### Queen of Wands

TRADITION: Country woman, honest, economical woman, honourable and
loving, virtuous, chaste, good and inclined to be friendly and interest
herself in the querent. The card may also indicate love of money,
economy and gifts.

THEORY: Queen of *Air* on the *Second house* of economy, money, country
life and art. Some of the traditional renderings certify this remarkably
well. Now what does a queen in general mean? In divination a woman
simply, but in general, as the king is the head of the hierarchy or suit
as the spiritual synthesis and masculine representative, so the queen
may be said to be the material synthesis and the chief female
representative. So the queen of wands must be, apart from all
personality, the representative of banking, exchange, agriculture and of
the arts in general, painting, music and dancing in particular. In
*W*.'s picture of this card, a cat is seen before the feet of this
queen: a remarkable indication of the house in which, as astrology
teaches, the moon is exalted. It indicates rightly, that in weak cases
there

may be some falsehood in the nature of persons indicated by it.
Cajolery, but apt to turn into peevishness. Taurus-people are generally
good-humoured and good-natured, patient, benefic for their surroundings
in material things, but also desirous of luxury and possessions, wealth,
riches.

CONCLUSION: *A woman of economical habits, wealthy or desiring wealth,
steadily resolved to get at riches, certainly not 'cheap'; more or less
artistic, may be a painter, dancer or musician; she is faithful, but may
be subject to moods and changes of taste. Honesty may be certified, but
not without a certain amount of egotism, e.g. materialism. She is very
passive and cool, phlegmatic and not easily to be roused to passion, if
ever. This of course makes the impression of 'chaste.' There is,
however, a solid sort of sensuality. In strong cases there is real
virtue. Banking, agriculture, art, capital, money*. The latter more to
be seen as 'money-matters' than as 'ready money,' and rather papers of
value, shares, bonds, banknotes, than coined money.
