#### Page of Pentacles

TRADITION: Dark young man, disciple, student, speculator, commercial
man. Application, scholarship, study, reflexion, meditation, occupation,
rule, management, news, message and the messenger himself. The reverse
meanings are here for once even given as favourable for the greater
part: Profession, luxury, sumptuousness, breadth, abundance,
magnificence, liberality, generosity, well-doing. Also the crowd,
multitude. Degradation, dissipation.

THEORY: The Page, always more or less of a messenger, in this case of
fiery nature, on the *Seventh house*, as well as on the *Third*. The
latter

house is that of the disciple and the message; so here the traditional
rendering is again quite correct. The seventh house explains everything
that is said about application, occupation, profession, liberality,
etc., this being the house of Libra, of relation. We may add, that the
card will indicate a proposal of marriage, courting, love-making, but in
a gentle, sometimes a poetical or platonic way, not without ardour
however. It has also to do with all sorts of honourable offices and
denominations and may indicate any official person in the civil service
and commerce, a stationer, bookseller or editor, bookkeeper or director,
appointed by the owner or patron.

CONCLUSION: *Disciple, student, messenger, and the message, good and
favourable news; a newsagent; honourable denomination, commission, news
about a position or relation, contract or profession. Liberal conduct of
people towards the querent. A director, directing manager, bookkeeper,
assistant. Editor, bookseller. Honourable mention. Agreeable conditions
in general. Application, study, reflexion, arrangement, occupation,
well-doing, goodness. May denote a meeting, a committee or a board of
directors*.
