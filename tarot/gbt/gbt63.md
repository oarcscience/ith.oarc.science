#### Five of Cups

TRADITION: Inheritance, legacy, succession, gift, testament,
transmission, tradition; all of them "not corresponding to expectations;
with some it is a card of marriage, but not without bitterness or
frustration." (*W*.) Reversed: Family, forefathers, ancestry. Liaison,
alliance, affinity, acquaintance, consanguinity. Race. "It is a card of
loss." (*W*.)

THEORY: The *Water* coming on the *First house*, the *ascendant*, and
water having to do with the family, we may conclude, that family matters
will come naturally to the querent in this case, just as they were swept
from him or evaded by him in the preceeding one. Still we cannot see,
that the card should denote the members of the family in particular, as
mentioned by *P*. and others. Now 'family-matters' may include
inheritance as well as marriage, but so many other things may also be
included that it is difficult to enumerate them, and none of them is

indicated particularly. So we do not think it wise to say anything more
definitely about this. The water of the feelings coming on the ascendant
indicates sensitiveness and emotion, which may bring sorrow A or
pleasure, but generally mixed experiences and not without care. There
may be material losses in consequence.

CONCLUSION: *Family-matters, care to be taken of them, sorrow or
pleasure, emotion, material difficulties; there may be some advantage
and some loss at the same time. News is certain to arrive. Subject to
influences from the surroundings and apt to react too quickly thereon*.
