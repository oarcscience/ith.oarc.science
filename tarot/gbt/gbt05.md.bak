#### THE GREATER ARCANA

In the Greater Arcana competent authors on the subject have rightly seen
a system of rendering or symbolising the great cosmic principles of
Creation *per se*. Not in relation to any special plane or element but
above these, and consequently to be considered as the abstract origin of
all and everything in the Lesser Arcana.

Papus gives us the descriptions of the Greater

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arcana from the
*Book of Hermes*, which probably will be the source *in concrete* of all
later descriptions up to our time. How this book has been delivered
through the ages is not known to me, but the clearness and systematic
accuracy of these descriptions are proof of a high origin.

Where Papus, in his book on *The Tarot of the Bohemians* ventures to
indicate relationship between the symbols of the Greater Arcana and
zodiacal and planetary principles, he is hopelessly wrong however. He
does not insist on it nor does he appear to make any use at all of these
relations or explain *how* they are to be found out. Logic is entirely
absent in this particular side of his renderings.

Without any difficulty or doubt we read in the first twelve arcanas the
essential natures of the twelve zodiacal houses. Thus:

<div align="center">

|        |        |                        |             |
|--------|--------|------------------------|-------------|
| Arcana | I.     | *The Magician*         | Aries       |
| „      | II\.   | *The High Priestess*   | Taurus      |
| „      | III\.  | *The Empress*          | Gemini      |
| „      | IV\.   | *The Emperor*          | Cancer      |
| „      | V.     | *The Hierophant*       | Leo         |
| „      | VI\.   | *The Lovers*           | Virgo       |
| „      | VII\.  | *The Chariot*          | Libra       |
| „      | VIII\. | *The Justice*          | Scorpio     |
| „      | IX\.   | *The Hermit*           | Sagittarius |
| „      | X.     | *The Wheel of Fortune* | Capricornus |
| „      | XI\.   | *The Strength*         | Aquarius    |
| „      | XII\.  | *The Hanged Man*       | Pisces      |

We do not know what sort of conclusions Dr. Papus and others may have
drawn for themselves, but it seems rather astonishing that this analogy
has never been stated in public. It is as easy to recognise

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

the nine planetary principles, i.e. those at present known to astronomy
and astrology, in the following arcanas. So we find:

<div align="center">

|        |         |                     |         |
|--------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Arcana | XIII\.  | *Death*             | Saturn  |
| „      | XIV\.   | *Temperance*        | Mercury |
| „      | XV\.    | *The Devil*         | Mars    |
| „      | XVI\.   | *The Tower*         | Uranus  |
| „      | XVII\.  | *The Star*          | Venus   |
| „      | XVIII\. | *The Moon*          | Moon    |
| „      | XIX\.   | *The Sun*           | Sun     |
| „      | XX\.    | *The Last Judgment* | Jupiter |
| „      | XXI\.   | *The World*         | Neptune |

</div>

while:

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arcana XXII or
Zero: the Fool must evidently be taken for the principle of the Earth
itself, upon which we are carried away in space without being able to
loose ourselves from its course. It may be as well interpreted as the
*Pars Fortunae*, which must not be mistaken for the 'Wheel of Fortune'
in the series of the arcanas. This has as much to do with the former as
the cusp of the Tenth house has in the horoscope with the *Pars
Fortunae*.

We shall treat everyone of these cards in its turn hereafter. First let
us have the scheme at large.
