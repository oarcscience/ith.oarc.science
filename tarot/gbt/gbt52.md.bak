#### Eight of Pentacles

TRADITION: A dark girl, honest girl. Reversed: usury, voided ambitions,
vanity, cupidity, avarice. *W*. says: "Work, employment, commission,
craftsmanship, skill in craft and business." Another

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

version has also: abundance, hospitality, politeness, kind reception,
majority, augmentation, etc.

THEORY: It is the *Fire* on the *Twelfth house*. This has not much to do
with useful work directly, nor with employment, but very much with skill
and ingenuity, genial finding-out of the nature of things, so
'craftsmanship' may stand. For the rest, it is the house of offering,
devotion, self-undoing, imprisonment and treason. The combination of the
fire of the heart with it produces very different effects. Above all it
gives skill and bravery, far above the average, outdoing the
commonplace, neglecting fashion, sinning against tradition but widening
the views and outlook. Dexterity will ensue from it. In matters of the
heart it always tends to the unusual, superhuman, exotic, wayward,
strange or dreamy. The illustration of the card is to be taken more as a
warning against the dangers of this house than as a direct descriptive
image of its nature; as a sort of hint: keep to your work, do not let
yourself be led astray or misguided. It is also the house of the sick,
the hospital and the addiction of 'hospitality' may well allude to this
fact. Charity comes under it. That ambitions are wrecked in this house
is correct in general, still the pentacles are never strong in any evil
sense, and they are apt to wreck fortunes or bubble reputations rather
than ambitions. With 'avarice' it has nothing to do whatever, as far as
we can see. The 'dark girl' is another question: apart from the
court-cards the *ace* is very often taken to indicate a boy or youth,
the *eight* a girl. The cups are generally taken to denote fair people,
the pentacles dark people. Apart from this Eteilla makes the

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

cards of wands--*ace* to *ten*--stand for young people, from one to
twenty years of age. The reason for this we have not found out. If the
eight always indicates a girl (which may be so because the eight always
falls upon a house of water, which is entirely feminine in its nature),
and the fiery pentacles must relate to dark-haired or even dark-skinned
people, then the indication is right, and we shall accept it as far as
it goes.

CONCLUSION: *Devotion to what is not a prescribed duty, charity, skill,
artistic ability, work done under inspiration, dexterity, uncommon
qualities, perhaps geniality or even genius. Researches into the
mysteries of Nature; nursing, work in hospitals or sanatoria, and these
institutions themselves. In weak cases misleading appearances, making a
useless show of activity. In very strong cases there is an artistic or
genial ability, which will be only appreciated later. There will
generally be sacrifice accompanying a work. Work for hospitals or
prisons. Good card for a medical man or a clergyman. In weak cases there
may be Bohemian love ending in degradation, depravation, waste of money,
etc., though never by this card alone. On the contrary, it may indicate
the conversion of a good-for-nothing to labour. Dark girl*.
