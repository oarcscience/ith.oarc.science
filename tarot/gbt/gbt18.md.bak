#### XI. Strength. Aquarius.

The astrologer says, that the Eleventh house is the house of the
'friends.' This means, that it contains those who are with us, and that
which we have within the limit of our power, because 'friendly,' is that
which is understood. The forces of nature, which we have mastered, are
friendly to us and this is very well expressed by the woman who "is
closing the jaws of a lion." The latter stands for passion more
particularly. She derives this force from the eternal or superhuman and
this is indicated by the lemnescate above her head. In older editions of
the card 4 we find half the symbol for Aquarius, as a line of vibration
added to it: <span id="img_06400"></span> ![](img/06400.jpg). Viewed
from a purely astrological standpoint it is evident, that the force to
conquer Leo should be found in the opposite sign, Aquarius. Early
Renaissance must have seen this in the same way, as we find exactly the
same image--only with one difference: it is there a young man, not a
woman--a man closing the jaws of a lion in the capital of a pillar in
the church of St. Andrew-the-Less in Vienna. Which proves at the same
time, that the chosen image is not of a very recent date. (*Musée du
Trocadéro:* Paris.)

*P*. identifies it with the Hebrew letter *Kaph*, which he says "is a
reinforcement of the *Gimel*--(Gemini)--so that we might say that it
designates the hand of

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

man in the act of grasping strongly. Ideas of strength are therefore
applied to this letter." We should say it is the grip of friendship. A
well-known symbol in many societies of brotherhood consisted of two
hands united in a close grip of friendship.

"It is connected with the mystery of union . . . in all planes . . ."
(*W*.), and this also is evident, because we are united with that which
we have mastered and with people who are able to respond to our
(electric) emanations of thought, or to whose emanations we ourselves
respond.
