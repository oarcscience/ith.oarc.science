#### Seven of Wands

TRADITION: Discussion, negotiation, conference, conversation,
deliberation, dissertation; measure; correspondence, words and language;
generally success, but there may be also some hesitation, uncertainty,
irresolution, light-heartedness.

THEORY: All this is very strikingly typifying the element *Air* on the
*Seventh house*, that of the airy Libra, house of relationship,
marriage, meeting of the Self and the Not-self, which rules contracts,
books and manuscripts. Here only comes 'discussion' into play. In the
Fifth house the individuality was alone, and for discussion you want two
persons.

CONCLUSION: *Discussion, relation, negotiation, entertainment,
discourse, lecture, reasonable explanation, contract, marriage proposed,
society-rulership and orders given out to inferiors, arrangements,
regularisation and measurement; measure, proportion, rules given for
conduct*. There is *uncertainty or opportunism* in so far as rules are
given in relation to circumstances, which may change. The personal
interests are brought in, in relation with those of others. *Fair
weather*.
