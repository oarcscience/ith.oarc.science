#### Page of Cups

TRADITION: Fair young man, studious. Work, application, reflexion,
occupation, observation. Profession, employment. News, message; has to

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

do with business. Reversed: Tendency, inclination, attraction,
attachment, friendship, desire, engagement, invitation, seduction.
Flattery, praise, cherishing, etc.

THEORY: The Page or servant, messenger, of the cups suit comes on the
*Eleventh* and on the *Seventh house*, and has to do with friendship and
relations, e.g. marriage. He must be the friend who brings inviting
messages, seductive proposals, if not of formal marriage, perhaps of
some love-affair or jolly gathering, sportive meeting, or intellectual
entertainment, lecture, etc. It is not quite impossible, that the idea
of 'seduction' is connected with it or at least a strong sense of
persuasion. If it relates to news, there is emotion in it, news that
will affect the feelings in some way or other. Relations will be of a
passing nature, but may be very pleasant. The combination of the Water
with the Air generally adds much to the instruction, development or
education of people So there must be much of all this in the Page of
Cups. The effects do not always bear the characteristic of reliability,
nor of permanence.

CONCLUSION--(On the eleventh house): *Friendly message, good news,
invitation, proposal and the bringer of the same. A young man of a
democratic turn of mind, brotherly feelings, international
relationship*. (On the seventh house): *Proposal of marriage or
love-affair, intellectual entertainment, lecture, demonstration.
Proposal or invitation to a position or employment. Solicitation. The
outcome of this card is still uncertain and must be derived from the
neighbouring cards. Change of relations and connections, sympathies*.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Tendency to
please and to make things and certain persons appear better than they
are in reality, either to flatter them or to seduce the querent. It may
also be that the querent will be flattered. Praise and persuasion. A man
very much open to sex-influences*.
