### THE LESSER ARCANA

The theory formulated in the first part of the present work must be
proved by practice; and here we are in the same lucky position as with
horoscopy, where we find also the most abstract world-vision

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

combined with the natural facts of everyday life: religion, philosophy
and science in one and testified to by facts, which can be verified by
every serious student, as easily as the facts of any other branch of
natural science.

We shall now deal with the Arcana Minor much on the same lines as we
have followed with the cards of the Arcana Major, only still more
abridged, if possible, in order to make the work clear and the
supervision easy, and so produce a handbook, as simple and practical as
possible for use in the practice of divination. We shall therefore first
give the generally accepted traditional meanings of each card, and then
derive the significance from the given theory.

The qualifications which we think fully justified by the theory, will be
put in italics.

We use as illustrations the pictures of the cards as they have been
drawn on the authority of Mr. A. E. Waite and published by Messrs. Rider
and Co., Paternoster Row, London.

Practical divination speaks of two ways in which the cards, in general,
have to be or can be interpreted: *right* and *reversed*, and the
professors of the art say it depends on the way the cards fall when they
are laid after being shuffled; it may be the image of the card comes
'right,' i.e. facing the querent, or upside down. The latter is called
'reversed.' This appears to me to be a rather arbitrary distinction,
because of course it costs you no trouble to put all cards 'right'
before shuffling and to keep them right all the time. But there may be
actually a stronger and a weaker side to each card of the Lesser Arcana,
as it may act on the higher or on the lower side of human nature, or it
may stand for ourselves

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

or for our opponents; it may either be fortified by benefic influences
of neighbouring cards and the planets, or weakened by malefics. So we
shall not protest against the term 'reversed,' but use it in a different
way and consider it simply as the pathological side of the genuine
significance, if we may be allowed to express it thus. Nor shall we
indicate it separately, but simply leave it to the consideration of the
professor of divination to decide if a fall is weak or more or less
pathological.

We might add one more remark, viz. regarding the nature of the Page and
the Knight. We place the Knight after the Page, which makes the former
fall upon the houses of Water and the Page on the houses of Air.
Tradition gives first the Knight and after him the Page. Astrologers
will feel the essential difference between both: the one is of the
nature of Air, the other of the nature of Water. The latter is more
'essential,' working on the sentiments, while the Page is rather working
on the intellectual plane of existence. The Knight brings the inner
change and link, the Page the outer change and connection. Of the two
the Page or Knave is the lesser or younger. Evidently the symbolic
figures have been chosen so as to express a difference of this kind. The
page may become a knight, after he has won experience. Now 'experience'
is the typical function of the houses or signs of *Water*. The
page-period in mediæval society was that of the disciple, of assisting,
learning; of carrying messages: all this is typical of houses or signs
of Air. The name of *Knave*, sometimes substituted for Page, is
doubtlessly given to indicate the 'secondary' importance of "those
people" in relation to the nobility of the other.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Air-people are
always more or less 'profane' in relation to water-people, and this has
been evidently expressed in the mediæval denomination.
