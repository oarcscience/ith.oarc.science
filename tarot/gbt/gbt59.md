#### CUPS

#### Ace.

TRADITION: Table, first as the symbol of the bearer of food,
alimentation, etc., then also as 'table of the law'; catalogue,
tabulation; the Holy Table. Meal, feast, gala, and invitation for the
same. Hotel, restaurant, etc. Picture, painting, image, description.

selling. Metamorphosis, reversal, revolution, translation,

THEORY: The Cups, representing the element of *Water*, Jovian and lunar
by nature, start their cycle on the *Ninth house*, the house of
Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, the lawgiver. The element Water has its
two polar effects in the soul, so we need not look for particular 'weak
cases' to demonstrate a more or less benefic and malific effect at the
same time. The house of Sagittarius, however, does not bring much evil
to the soul and is generally uplifting, inviting, pushing towards
progress and development, journeying and hospitable reception of
strangers. There is little or no stability or fixity in it, but on the
contrary always a good deal of 'mutation'; also the magic power of the
true transmutation. Further we find a tendency to teach,

to translate, guide, interpret. It may, too, lead to extravagance as
regards dissipation or at least spending. There is sanction or even
holiness in it, inspiration, idealism. The latter, of course, may lead
to more or less well-directed actions.

CONCLUSION: *Sanction, permission, inspiration, idealism, enthusiasm,
blessing. May denote a leader, teacher, guide or any influence of this
nature. Legislation, direction, instruction; hospitality and sympathetic
reception. Driving, hunting, travelling; planning for the future.
Invitation, convocation, appeal. Mutation and transmutation. Translation
and interpretation*.
