HE significance of the cards--Greater as well as Lesser Arcana--as it
has been delivered through the ages, is often remarkably accurate, as
far as can be verified. In what way, however, it has come down to us,
and what reasonable ground there may be for the given meanings, remain
mysteries, not to be elucidated by the present author. By verification
we mean theoretical consideration on the basis both of astrological
systematics and of the practice of divination. The fact is, that the
traditional significance is generally in accordance with the
astrological explanation of the cards as we have given it here, though
this explanation has not yet been offered by any author before, as far
as we know. So we may conclude, that this key has been lost or has been
hidden from those who kept the practice alive and left the system to us.

In the following pages we shall give the meaning of both Greater and
Lesser Arcana after the astrological theory expounded by us, together
with a short résumé of the traditional significance, the latter taken
chiefly from Papus and from the renderings of Mr. Waite. For the sake of
shortness and simplicity we shall mark our quotations with *P* for
Papus, *W* for A. E. Waite, *M* for S. L. MacGregor Mathers.
