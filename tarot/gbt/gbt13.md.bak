#### VI. The Lovers. Virgo.

From the original meaning of the sign Virgo, the virgin matter of the
cosmos or world-ether, to that principle which makes 'lovers' is rather
a long step,

but we will observe that all these Tarot symbols relate to human points
of view and human life in particular, i.e. cosmic principles seen from
this particular standpoint which gives more of a practical image than of
abstract reasoning, the abstract cosmic significance, however, being
imbedded fairly accurately in them. So in the human constitution the
sign Virgo means the nervous system and everything acting as an organ as
well as the relatively 'virginal matter' which is extracted from the
food and will serve to build up the body. So this house is known to rule
health and sickness. It is further known to relate to the principles and
materials of our work. And so the card of the Lovers must in the first
place symbolise these things. It does indeed. *P*. says it is connected
with the Hebrew letter *Vau* in its significance of "the eye, and all
that relates to light and brilliancy. The eye establishes the link
between the external world and ourselves; by it light and form are
revealed to us." In fact 'the eye' is a very ancient symbol for the idea
of 'organ'; the Neoplatonists repeatedly used it. When saying it
"establishes the link," we must be aware, however, that it is not yet
this link itself but offers the elements for it. And again this card
does not say 'love' but 'lovers' (in the French edition of the cards the
singular is used: *l’amoureux*). Evidently the meaning is this: what
makes man feel 'amorous' is his sensuousness, the word used in the
strictly philosophical and biological meaning of receptivity of the
senses for agreeable, caressing, benefic, gratifying vibrations. The
same receptivity, however, exists on the other hand for disagreeable,
painful, disturbing, malific vibrations. The receptivity and the
condition of

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

an organic centre in its double possibility of experience is only the
phenomenal expression of the same in organic existence in general,
consequently stamping the whole of manifestation with the law of duality
of 'good' and 'evil.' The latter is well illustrated by the picture on
the older cards where a youth is represented standing between two women,
the one appearing to be benefic, the other malific. This sensuousness
indeed can lead to a lower sensuality or can be the means of
demonstrating love. A sort of angelic figure (Cupid?) is seen shooting
an arrow: symbol of the ray of light. The card which was drawn on the
authority of Mr. *W*. shows a man and a woman in a state of paradisical
nudity, and over the two hovers the figure of an angel. It confers much
the same meaning, of course. "This is in all simplicity the card of
human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life."
(*W*.) And we shall find, that the same force which makes us love,
physically, is at the back of all the work we do. Because it is the
material response to the fiery and central pushing power and includes
actual possibility on the basis of practical knowledge, experimental
knowing. *W*. did well to show the Tree of Knowledge in the drawing, it
being the symbol of Nature in general and of the seed or seminal
elements.
