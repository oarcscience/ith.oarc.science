#### Four of Cups

TRADITION: Annoyance, aversion, disgust, affliction, discontent (with
his environment), satiety; blended pleasure. Reversed: News, presage,
new light on things, novelty, new acquaintances made, etc.

THEORY: The *Water* of the soul on the *Twelfth house*, which rules many
changes, and adverse influences and, in general, the surroundings so far
as they are not yet mastered, and therefore inimical. Indeed this house
brings much affliction in matters of the world; materially it is
anything but successful and in this respect will certainly bring
annoyances, but on the other hand new knowledge of Nature's wonders is
revealed in this house. Discontent with environment, certainly, but at
the same time it shows the querent throwing his future on the waters of
new adventure, leaving home and family to wander forth towards new
experiences, enlarging the horizon of his views. There may be some
ailment of the soul, however, in this house and in very weak cases
alienation even. Sentiments not reciprocated, nor understood. A feeling
of being outside one's proper environment.

There may be encounters with strangers or foreigners, and discoveries,
as results of discontent or dissatisfaction with present conditions. So
in relation to these conditions it may mean: failing to understand or to
appreciate things as they are, estrangement

of the world, which may lead to seclusion; secluded feelings.

CONCLUSION: *Discontent with present conditions or environment;
estrangement, unrest, aversion, troubles, disgust; discord, failing to
understand people or to make oneself understood. New discoveries,
researches in unknown countries or territories, meeting with strangers.
Instability, changes, generally for the worse in a material sense, but
having some distant aim. At war with current opinions. Better to keep
silent than to talk, because one will certainly be misunderstood. There
may be "imaginary vexations."* (*W*.) *Seclusion; alienation*.
