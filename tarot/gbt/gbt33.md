#### Three of Wands

TRADITION: Enterprise, effort, essay, trade, commerce, discovery,
usurpation, daring, temerity and also imprudence, interruption,
cessation and 'the end of troubles,' discontinuative.

THEORY: The rather contradictory descriptions of this card's
significance are well explained by its zodiacal position: *Air* on the
*Third house*, which doubles the influence of 'air' and of the mercurial
vibrations and effects. This card has the accent of the suit of wands.
It must consequently denote: communication, reflection and all that
comes from these. This needs little explanation.

CONCLUSION: *Communication, instruction, reflexion, message, writing,
postage and letters, superficial knowledge*,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

*airiness, passing impressions, discontinuance, interruption, change*,
perhaps a certain amount of *geniality, imprudence* also; neglect or
want of proper attention; as to 'temerity' I should say only in so far
as this means an *easy manner of overcoming obstacles, quick insight;
effort, essay, trade* are correct. Mercury being the God of merchants,
and thieves, this card may relate to *commerce, theft and loss*. "*The
end of troubles*" is indeed well said, because this card gives the key
for their solution and shows the way of escape.
