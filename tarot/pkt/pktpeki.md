The figure calls for no special description the face is rather dark,
suggesting also courage, but somewhat lethargic in tendency. The bull's
head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of
this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the
pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human
nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs
this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented
the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in
respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is
on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal
especially with questions of money. *Divinatory Meanings*: Valour,
realizing intelligence, business and normal intellectual aptitude,
sometimes mathematical gifts and attainments of this kind; success in
these paths. *Reversed*: Vice, weakness, ugliness, perversity,
corruption, peril.
