A laurelled horseman bears one staff adorned with a laurel crown;
footmen with staves are at his side. *Divinatory Meanings*: The card has
been so designed that it can cover several significations; on the
surface, it is a victor triumphing, but it is also great news, such as
might be carried in state by the King's courier; it is expectation
crowned with its own desire, the crown of hope, and so forth.
*Reversed*: Apprehension, fear, as of a victorious enemy at the gate;
treachery, disloyalty, as of gates being opened to the enemy; also
indefinite delay.
