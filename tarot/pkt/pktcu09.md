A goodly personage has feasted to his heart's content, and abundant
refreshment of wine is on the arched counter behind him, seeming to
indicate that the future is also assured. The picture offers the
material side only, but there are other aspects. *Divinatory Meanings*:
Concord, contentment, physical *bien-être*; also victory, success,
advantage; satisfaction for the Querent or person for whom the
consultation is made. *Reversed*: Truth, loyalty, liberty; but the
readings vary and include mistakes, imperfections, etc.
