The physical and emotional nature to which this card is attributed is
dark, ardent, lithe, animated, impassioned, noble. The King uplifts a
flowering wand, and wears, like his three correspondences in the
remaining suits, what is called a cap of maintenance beneath his crown.
He connects with the symbol of the lion, which is emblazoned on the back
of his throne. *Divinatory Meanings*: Dark man, friendly, countryman,
generally married, honest and conscientious. The card always signifies
honesty, and may mean news concerning an unexpected heritage to fall in
before very long. *Reversed*: Good, but severe; austere, yet tolerant.
