He holds a short sceptre in his left hand and a great cup in his right;
his throne is set upon the sea; on one side a ship is riding and on the
other a dolphin is leaping. The implicit is that the Sign of the Cup
naturally refers to water, which appears in all the court cards.
*Divinatory Meanings*: Fair man, man of business, law, or divinity;
responsible, disposed to oblige the Querent; also equity, art and
science, including those who profess science, law and art; creative
intelligence. *Reversed*: Dishonest, double-dealing man; roguery,
exaction, injustice, vice, scandal, pillage, considerable loss.
