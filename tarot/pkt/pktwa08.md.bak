The card represents motion through the immovable-a flight of wands
through an open country; but they draw to the term of their course. That
which they signify is at hand; it may be even on the threshold.
*Divinatory Meanings*: Activity in undertakings, the path of such
activity, swiftness, as that of an express messenger; great haste, great
hope, speed towards an end which promises assured felicity; generally,
that which is on the move; also the arrows of love. *Reversed*: Arrows
of jealousy, internal dispute, stingings of conscience, quarrels; and
domestic disputes for persons who are married.
