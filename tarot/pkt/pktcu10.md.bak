Appearance of Cups in a rainbow; it is contemplated in wonder and
ecstacy by a man and woman below, evidently husband and wife. His right
arm is about her; his left is raised upward; she raises her right arm.
The two children dancing near them have not observed the prodigy but are
happy after their own manner. There is a home-scene beyond. *Divinatory
Meanings*: Contentment, repose of the entire heart; the perfection of
that state; also perfection of human love and friendship; if with
several picture-cards, a person who is taking charge of the Querent's
interests; also the town, village or country inhabited by the Querent.
*Reversed*: Repose of the false heart, indignation, violence.
