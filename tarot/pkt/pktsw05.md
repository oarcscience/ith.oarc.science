A disdainful man looks after two retreating and dejected figures. Their
swords lie upon the ground. He carries two others on his left shoulder,
and a third sword is in his right hand, point to earth. He is the master
in possession of the field. *Divinatory Meanings*: Degradation,
destruction, revocation, infamy, dishonour, loss, with the variants and
analogues of these. *Reversed*: The same; burial and obsequies.
