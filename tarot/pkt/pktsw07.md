A man in the act of carrying away five swords rapidly; the two others of
the card remain stuck in the ground. A camp is close at hand.
*Divinatory Meanings*: Design, attempt, wish, hope, confidence; also
quarrelling, a plan that may fail, annoyance. The design is uncertain in
its import, because the significations are widely at variance with each
other. *Reversed*: Good advice, counsel, instruction, slander, babbling.
