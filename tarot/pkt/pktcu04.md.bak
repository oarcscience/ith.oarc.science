A young man is seated under a tree and contemplates three cups set on
the grass before him; an arm issuing from a cloud offers him another
cup. His expression notwithstanding is one of discontent with his
environment. *Divinatory Meanings*: Weariness, disgust, aversion,
imaginary vexations, as if the wine of this world had caused satiety
only; another wine, as if a fairy gift, is now offered the wastrel, but
he sees no consolation therein. This is also a card of blended pleasure.
*Reversed*: Novelty, presage, new instruction, new relations.
