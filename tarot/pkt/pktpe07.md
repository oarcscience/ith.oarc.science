A young man, leaning on his staff, looks intently at seven pentacles
attached to a clump of greenery on his right; one would say that these
were his treasures and that his heart was there. *Divinatory Meanings*:
These are exceedingly contradictory; in the main, it is a card of money,
business, barter; but one reading gives altercation, quarrels--and
another innocence, ingenuity, purgation. *Reversed*: Cause for anxiety
regarding money which it may be proposed to lend.
