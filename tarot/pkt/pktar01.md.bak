### I

### The Magician

A youthful figure in the robe of a magician, having the countenance of
divine Apollo, with smile of confidence and shining eyes. Above his head
is the mysterious sign of the Holy Spirit, the sign of life, like an
endless cord, forming the figure 8 in a horizontal position . About his
waist is a serpent-cincture, the serpent appearing to devour its own
tail. This is familiar to most as a conventional symbol of eternity, but
here it indicates more especially the eternity of attainment in the
spirit. In the Magician's right hand is a wand raised towards heaven,
while the left hand is pointing to the earth. This dual sign is known in
very high grades of the Instituted Mysteries; it shews the descent of
grace, virtue and light, drawn from things above and derived to things
below. The suggestion throughout is therefore the possession and
communication of the Powers and Gifts of the Spirit. On the table in
front of the Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits,
signifying the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before
the adept, and he adapts them as he wills. Beneath are roses and lilies,
the *flos campi* and *lilium convallium*, changed into garden flowers,
to shew the culture of aspiration. This card signifies the divine motive
in man, reflecting God, the will in the liberation of its union with
that which is above. It is also the unity of individual being on all
planes, and in a very high sense it is thought, in the fixation thereof.
With further reference to what I have called the sign of life and its
connexion with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian
Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change "unto the Ogdoad."
The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk
and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to
Martinism, 8 is the number of Christ.
