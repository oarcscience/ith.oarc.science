A sculptor at his work in a monastery. Compare the design which
illustrates the Eight of Pentacles. The apprentice or amateur therein
has received his reward and is now at work in earnest. *Divinatory
Meanings*: *Métier*, trade, skilled labour; usually, however, regarded
as a card of nobility, aristocracy, renown, glory. *Reversed*:
Mediocrity, in work and otherwise, puerility, pettiness, weakness.
