From the four great staves planted in the foreground there is a great
garland suspended; two female figures uplift nosegays; at their side is
a bridge over a moat, leading to an old manorial house. *Divinatory
Meanings*: They are for once almost on the surface--country life, haven
of refuge, a species of domestic harvest-home, repose, concord, harmony,
prosperity, peace, and the perfected work of these. *Reversed*: The
meaning remains unaltered; it is prosperity, increase, felicity, beauty,
embellishment.
