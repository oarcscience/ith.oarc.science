A dark, cloaked figure, looking sideways at three prone cups two others
stand upright behind him; a bridge is in the background, leading to a
small keep or holding. *Divanatory Meanings*: It is a card of loss, but
something remains over; three have been taken, but two are left; it is a
card of inheritance, patrimony, transmission, but not corresponding to
expectations; with some interpreters it is a card of marriage, but not
without bitterness or frustration. *Reversed*: News, alliances,
affinity, consanguinity, ancestry, return, false projects.
