A hand issues from a cloud, grasping as word, the point of which is
encircled by a crown. *Divinatory Meanings*: Triumph, the excessive
degree in everything, conquest, triumph of force. It is a card of great
force, in love as well as in hatred. The crown may carry a much higher
significance than comes usually within the sphere of fortune-telling.
*Reversed*: The same, but the results are disastrous; another account
says--conception, childbirth, augmentation, multiplicity.
