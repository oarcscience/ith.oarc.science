### CHAPTER V

<span class="small">*What the Cards can Tell of the Past, the Present,
and the Future A simple method—What the cards say—The present—The
future*.</span>

#### A Simple Method.

THERE is a very simple and generally accepted method of studying the
past, the present, and the future in the light of cartomancy. The
selected pack of thirty-two cards is required, and they must be shuffled
and cut in the ordinary way. After the cut the packs must not be placed
one upon the other until the top card of the lower one and the bottom
card of the upper one have been placed aside to form the surprise. The
remaining thirty cards are then to be dealt into three equal packs
which, beginning at the left, represent respectively the Past, the
Present, and the Future.

We will suppose that the knave of hearts, a pleasure-seeking young
bachelor, is the inquirer.

The ten cards representing the Past are as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The queen of clubs, reversed.  
The king of diamonds, reversed.  
The ten of clubs, reversed.  
The nine of diamonds.  
The eight of clubs.  
The ace of diamonds, reversed.  
The ace of hearts, reversed.  
The knave of spades, reversed.  
The queen of spades, reversed.  
The eight of diamonds.

</div>

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

There are three pairs among the ten. Two queens, both reversed, which
remind the inquirer that he has had to suffer from the consequences of
his own actions. The two aces, also both reversed, refer to some
partnership into which he entered with good intentions but which was
doomed to failure. The two eights speak of his frivolous pleasures and
countless evanescent love affairs.

#### What the Cards Say.

We will now see what the cards have to say, taken in order. We begin
with the queen of clubs, reversed, a dark woman tormented by jealousy,
in which she was encouraged by the king of diamonds, reversed, who is a
treacherous schemer, wishing no good to the inquirer. The ten of clubs
tells of a sea voyage, and is followed by the nine of diamonds, showing
that there were vexations and annoyances on that voyage. The eight of
clubs speaks of the Inquirer's having possessed the affections of a dark
woman, who would have contributed largely to his prosperity and
happiness. The ace of diamonds, reversed, represents evil tidings that
reached him in connection with the ace of hearts, reversed, which stands
for a change of abode, and emanating from the knave of spades, reversed,
a legal agent who was not to be trusted. There was also the queen of
spades, a designing widow, with whom he had, the eight of diamonds,
certain love passages.

##### The Present.

The ten cards in the centre pack are as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ace of spades, reversed.  
Seven of diamonds.  
Eight of hearts.  
Queen of hearts.  
Seven of hearts.  
Queen of diamonds, reversed.  
Nine of spades.  
King of hearts, reversed.  
Knave of hearts, reversed.  
Ten of diamonds.

</div>

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

In this pack we have only two pairs, two sevens speaking of mutual love;
and two queens, one being reversed, which suggest rivalry.

Taken in order the pack reads thus:—

The ace of spades, reversed, speaks of sorrow in which he will be
treated with a certain amount of heartless chaff and want of sympathy,
as it is followed by the seven of diamonds. The eight of hearts tells us
that he is entertaining thoughts of marriage, with the queen of hearts,
a fair, lovable girl; but the seven of hearts shows that he is very
contented with his present condition and in no hurry to change it. He is
amusing himself with the queen of diamonds, reversed, who is a born
flirt, but more spiteful than he suspects, and who is next to the worst
card in the pack, the nine of spades, indicative of the harm she does to
him, and the failure of his matrimonial plans. He is cut out by the king
of hearts, who thus causes him a serious disappointment, and we see him,
himself, reversed as the lover with a grievance; the last card is the
ten of diamonds, so he has decided to ease his heartache by travelling.

##### The Future.

This pack contains the following cards:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The knave of diamonds, reversed.  
The seven of clubs.  
The eight of spades, reversed.  
The seven of spades, reversed.  
The ten of spades.  
The nine of hearts.  
The king of clubs.  
The ten of hearts.  
The king of spades.  
The ace of clubs, reversed.

</div>

The presence of four spades foretells that trouble awaits our bachelor.
We again have a pair of sevens, but one is reversed, so he may expect
deceit to be at work. The two tens promise him an unlooked-for stroke of
tuck to be met with in a new walk in life, while the two kings speak of
cooperation in business and of the success which will crown his upright
and practical conduct. The wish card, the nine

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of hearts, and the ten of hearts in a great measure counteract the
mischief represented by the spades.

The inquirer must beware of the knave of diamonds, reversed, who is a
mischief maker, who will make use of the seven of clubs, trifling
financial matters, either to break off an engagement or to cause an
offer of marriage to be refused, as shown by the eight of spades,
reversed. The chagrined lover will have recourse to silly stratagems in
his love-making, the seven of spades, reversed, and this error will
cause him grief, even to the shedding of tears, the ten of spades. The
wish card, the nine of hearts, however, brings him better luck in his
love affairs through the instrumentality of his trusty, generous friend,
the king of clubs. His ill-fortune is further discounted by the next
card, the ten of hearts, which promises him prosperity and success. He
will find an enemy in the king of spades, a dark widower, who is a
lawyer by profession, and none too scrupulous in his ways. He may expect
a good deal of troublesome correspondence with this man, as shown by the
last card, the ace of clubs, reversed.

The subject of this correspondence is possibly to be found in the
surprise, which consists of the nine of clubs, reversed, meaning an
unexpected acquisition of money under a will. He will do well to take
heed when in the companionship of the knave of clubs, reversed, the
second card of the surprise for he is a flatterer and a somewhat
irresponsible character.
