### CHAPTER II

#### What the Individual Cards Signify

<span class="small">*Two systems—The English method—The
foreign—Significations of the cards—Hearts—Diamonds—Clubs—Spades—A short
table—Mystic meanings*.</span>

#### Two Systems.

THERE are two separate systems of explaining the cards individually: one
which makes use of the whole pack of fifty-two cards, and another which
only employs thirty-two, throwing out the plain cards under seven of
each suit.

#### The English Method.

The former plan is sometimes spoken of as the English method, and in it
we do not find mention of reversed cards bearing a different meaning
from those which come out in the ordinary way. This is probably to be
explained by the fact that the larger number in use affords sufficient
shades of meaning, and the task of remembering one hundred and four
significations would be too heavy for many minds.

#### The Foreign.

In the latter system, which is more distinctly traceable to foreign
sources, we get the signification of each card modified, or even
contradicted, by its position being upright or the reverse.

The following definitions apply to the use of the whole pack, and have
been worked up from both ancient and modern sources of information. It
must always be borne in mind that the reading of the cards has come down
to

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

us through many ages, has been passed on to us through count less hands
and in varied tongues. Cartomancy has travelled from the East to the
West, from the South to the North, and its secrets have been, for the
most part, jealously preserved by oral tradition among its weird and
fascinating votaries.

#### Significations of the Cards.

The following definitions are based upon one of the oldest authorities
dealing with the subject, and have been amplified by some of the more
modern meanings now in vogue,

##### HEARTS.

*Ace*.—An important card, whose meaning is affected by its environment.
Among hearts it implies love, friendship, and affection; with diamonds,
money and news of distant friends; with clubs, festivities, and social
or domestic rejoicing; with, spades, disagreements, misunderstandings,
contention, or misfortune; individually, it stands for the house.

*King*.—A good-hearted man, with strong affections, emotional, and given
to rash judgments, possessing more zeal than discretion.

*Queen*.—A fair woman, loving and lovable, domesticated, prudent, and
faithful.

*Knave*.—Not endowed with any sex. Sometimes taken as Cupid; also as the
best friend of the inquirer, or as a fair person's thoughts. The cards
on either side of the knave are indicative of the good or bad nature of
its intentions.

*Ten*.—A sign of good fortune. It implies a good heart, happiness, and
the prospect of a large family. It counteracts bad cards and confirms
good ones in its vicinity.

*Nine*.—The wish card. It is the sign of riches, and of high social
position accompanied by influence and esteem. It may be affected by the
neighbourhood of bad cards.

*Eight*.—The pleasures of the table, convivial society. Another meaning
implies love and marriage.

*Seven*.—A faithless, inconstant friend who may prove an enemy.

*Six*.—A confiding nature, liberal, open-handed, and an easy prey for
swindlers; courtship, and a possible proposal.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

*Five*.—Causeless jealousy in a person of weak, unsettled character.

*Four*.—One who has remained single till middle life from being too hard
to please.

*Three*.—A warning card as to the possible results of the inquirer's own
want of prudence and tact.

*Deuce*.—Prosperity and success in a measure dependent on the
surrounding cards; endearments and wedding bells.

##### DIAMONDS.

*Ace*.—A ring or paper money.

*King*.—A fair man, with violent temper, and a vindictive, obstinate
turn of mind.

*Queen*.—A fair woman, given to flirtation, fond of society and
admiration.

*Knave*.—A near relative who puts his own interests first, is
self-opinionated, easily offended, and not always quite straight. It may
mean a fair person's thoughts.

*Ten*.—Plenty of money, a husband or wife from the country, and several
children.

*Nine*.—This card is influenced by the one accompanying it; if the
latter be a court card, the person referred to will have his capacities
discounted by a restless, wandering disposition. It may imply a surprise
connected with money, or if in conjunction with the eight of spades it
signifies cross swords.

*Eight*.—A marriage late in life, which will probably be somewhat
chequered.

*Seven*.—This card has various meanings. It enjoins the need for careful
action. It may imply a decrease of prosperity. Another reading connects
it with uncharitable tongues.

*Six*.—An early marriage and speedy widowhood. A warning with regard to
second marriage is also included.

*Five*.—To young married people this portends good children. In a
general way it means unexpected news, or success in business
enterprises.

*Four*.—Breach of confidence. Troubles caused by inconstant friends,
vexations and disagreeables.

*Three*.—Legal and domestic quarrels, and probable un-Sappiness caused
by wife's or husband's temper.

*Deuce*.—An unsatisfactory love affair, awakening opposition from
relatives or friends.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

##### CLUBS.

*Ace*.—Wealth, a peaceful home, industry, and general prosperity.

*King*.—A dark man of upright, high-minded nature. calculated to make an
excellent husband, faithful and true in his affections.

*Queen*.—A dark woman, with a trustful, affectionate disposition, with
great charm for the opposite sex, and susceptible to male attractions.

*Knave*.—A generous, trusty friend, who will take trouble on behalf of
the inquirer. It may also mean a dark man's thoughts.

*Ten*.—Riches suddenly acquired, probably through the death of a
relation or friend.

*Nine*.—Friction through opposition to the wishes of friends.

*Eight*.—Love of money, and a passion for speculating.

*Seven*.—Great happiness and good fortune. If troubles come they will be
caused by one of the opposite sex to the inquirer.

*Six*.—Success in business both for self and children.

*Five*.—An advantageous marriage.

*Four*.—A warning against falsehood and double-dealing.

*Three*.—Two or possibly three marriages, with money.

*Deuce*.—Care is needed to avert disappointment, and to avoid
opposition.

##### SPADES.

await the inquirer through bad speculations or ill-chosen friends.

*King*.—A dark man. Ambitious and successful in the higher walks of
life.

*Queen*.—A widow, of malicious and unscrupulous nature, fond of scandal
and open to bribes.

*Knave*.—A well-meaning, inert person, unready in action though kindly

*Three*.—A marriage that will be marred by the inconstancy of the
inquirer's wife or husband; or a journey.

*Deuce*.—A removal, or possibly death.

In connection with the foregoing detailed explanation of the meanings of
each card in an ordinary pack, we append a short table, which may be
studied either separately or with the preceding definitions. It gives at
a glance certain broad outlines, which may be of use to one who wishes
to acquire the art of reading a card directly it is placed before the
eye:

#### Mystic Meanings.

There is fascination in certain calculations, and the following figures
are not without a deep interest to those attracted by the study of
Cartomancy.

The fifty-two cards in the pack correspond with the fifty-two weeks in
the year.

The thirteen cards in each suit symbolise the thirteen lunar months, and
the thirteen weeks in each quarter.

There are four suits, as there are four seasons in the year. There are
twelve court cards in the pack, just as there are twelve calendar months
and twelve signs of the Zodiac.

#### A Curious Calculation.

|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Number of pips on the plain cards of the four suits | 220        |
|     „      „      „     court      „      „         | 12         |
| Twelve court cards, counted as 10 each              | 120        |
| Number of cards in each suit                        | <u> 13</u> |
| Equal to the number of days in the year             | 365        |
