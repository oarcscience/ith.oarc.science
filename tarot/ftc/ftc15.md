### CHAPTER XIII

#### The Master Method

<span class="small">*Knowledge is power—Four twos added to the usual
pack—The thirty-six squares and their significance—Tendencies of the
suits*.</span>

#### Knowledge is Power.

WE have here a detailed and exhaustive method by which the cards can be
read. The beginner may feel somewhat alarmed at the mass of explanatory
matter there is for him to study, but when once the information has been
acquired, the would-be cartomancer will find he possesses a sense of
power and comprehension, that will give both confidence and dexterity to
his attempts to unravel the thread of destiny.

#### Four Twos Added to the Usual Pack.

The selected pack of thirty-two cards, which have been mentioned in
connection with several of the preceding methods, are in this case
augmented by the addition of the four twos, one of which is sometimes
taken as the representative of the inquirer. There is no hard and fast
rule about this, however, and another card may be taken if preferred.
The accompanying table shows that not only has each card its own
signification, but that every position upon the table within the cube in
which the cards are arranged has its own meaning. These must be
carefully studied, first separately and then together. It would be a
help to the beginner to make a separate chart for his own use, and to
have it at hand when laying the cards according to this system.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

The thirty-six cards must be shuffled and cut in the usual way, and then
placed upon the table in six rows of six cards each, starting from the
left-hand corner where square No. 1 is marked on the chart. The position
of the inquirer must be carefully noted, and then all the cards in his
immediate neighbourhood must be read in all their bearing, individually,
and with regard to their position, and their influence upon the

Covered by a heart, the inquirer will rapidly acquire a large fortune,
by making a hit in his profession, or by a lucky speculation.

Covered by a club, by hard work and sustained effort the inquirer will
secure a competence, and will receive both help and encouragement from
his friends.

Covered by a diamond, through misplaced confidence in unworthy friends
the inquirer will see his fortune pass into dishonest hands.

Covered by a spade, not only will the inquirer be tricked out of his
money by dishonest acquaintances, but he will have to suffer for their
misdeeds in his business or profession.

##### No. 33. INDIFFERENCE.

Covered by a heart, thanks to his indifference and want of heart the

realised.

consequences of perfectly justifiable steps which he may take to
accomplish his desire.

##### No. 36, SICKNESS—ILL-HEALTH.

Covered by a heart, the inquirer will suffer from passing ailments, that
will leave no bad results.

Covered by a club, a rather serious illness may be expected.

Covered by a diamond, an acute attack of a definite disease.

Covered by a spade, a very severe illness, that may materially interfere
with the inquirer's career or happiness.

#### Tendencies of the Suits.

It will be seen in the foregoing definitions that hearts are almost
invariably the sign of good luck, love, and happiness. Even where the
position is indicative of misfortune, the presence of a heart has a
mitigating effect upon the evil. Clubs rank next in order of good
fortune, and seem specially connected with the precious gift of true
friendship. Diamonds seem accompanied by the disquieting elements of
jealousy and rivalry, which strew obstacles in the path to success and
happiness, while for sheer bad luck and dire disaster the ill-omened
suit of spades stands unrivalled.
