### CHAPTER XII

#### How They Tell Fortunes in Italy

<span class="small">*Italian method—An example—Notice the groups—How the
pairs work out—The five packs*.</span>

#### Italian Method.

ONLY thirty-two cards are used for the Italian method of
fortune-telling, all the numbers under seven, except the ace, being
taken out of each suit. This reduced pack—containing the ace, king,
queen, knave, ten, nine, eight, and seven of the four suits—must be
carefully shuffled and cut, with the left hand of course, by the
inquirer. The one who is going to act as interpreter then takes the
pack, and turns them up three at a time. Should three cards of one suit
be turned up at once, they are all laid upon the table, face upwards; if
only two of a suit come out together, the higher card is selected; if
all three belong to different suits, they are all rejected.

When the pack has been dealt out in this manner the cards that have not
been chosen are taken up, shuffled, and cut a second time. The deal by
threes is then repeated until there are fifteen cards upon the table.
They must be placed in line, from left to right, as they appear.

It is absolutely necessary that the card representing the inquirer
should be among those on the table. Some authorities maintain, however,
that in the event of its not coming out during the deals, the whole
process must be repeated until it makes its appearance. Others again
take the card out, and place it on the table when fourteen others have
been selected.

The next step is to count five cards from the representative one and to
continue counting in fifths from each fifth card

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

until all have been included, or the counting has come back to the
representative. The signification of every card is read as it is
reached, due notice being taken as to whether it is reversed or not, and
the surrounding circumstances must also be balanced by the interpreter.

When this reading is complete the fifteen cards must be paired, one from
each end of the line being taken and read together, while the remaining
odd one must be dealt with separately.

The third process is to shuffle and cut the fifteen cards, and deal them
out into five small packs: one for *the lady herself;* one for *the
house;* one for *those who do not expect it;* one for *those who do
expect it;* one for *the surprise;* and one, which is not to be covered,
for *consolation*. When the fifteen cards have been dealt out, it will
be seen that four of the packs contain three cards, and the fifth only
two. These must all be turned face upwards and read in separate packs,
but with the connecting idea that they all refer to the fortune of the
inquirer.

#### An Example.

Let us imagine that a very fair lady, represented by the queen of
diamonds, is seeking to read her fortune.

The fifteen cards come out in the following order:—

The queen of diamonds; nine of diamonds, reversed; queen of hearts; king
of spades; ten of diamonds; seven of diamonds, reversed; knave of
hearts, reversed; ten of hearts; knave of diamonds; ace of diamonds,
reversed; knave of spades; nine of spades; king of clubs; ten of spades,
reversed; ace of hearts.

We begin to count from the queen of diamonds, the representative card,
and find the nine of diamonds to be the fifth from it. By this first
count we see from the nine being reversed that there is a love quarrel
troubling the inquirer. Starting again from the nine we come to the
queen of hearts, a mild, good-natured, but not very wise woman, who is
probably the tool of the next fifth card, the king of spades, a crafty,
ambitious man, and an enemy to the queen of diamonds.

Our next count is to the ten of diamonds, which speaks of

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

a journey for the inquirer. Passing on to the seven of diamonds,
reversed, we get hold of a foolish scandal connected with, if not
entirely caused by, the next count, which is the knave of hearts,
reversed, and stands for a military man who is very discontented with
the treatment he has received at the hands of the fair inquirer. She
will, however, triumph over this foolish annoyance, for the ten of
hearts comes next in order, and counteracts the harm involved by the
other cards.

Our gentle lady has, unfortunately, an unfaithful friend in the knave of
diamonds; and he is followed by the ace of diamonds, reversed, which
portends a letter on the way containing bad news. The writer of this is
a dark young man of no social position, and he probably is the servant
of one who is dear to the queen of diamonds. The bad news is found in
the next count, the nine of spades, which tells of sickness affecting
the king of clubs, the warm-hearted, chivalrous man who occupies the
first place in the inquirer's affections. The last count but one brings
us to the ten of spades, reversed, by which we know that the lady's
sorrow will be but brief; and it is followed by the ace of hearts, a
love letter containing the good news of her lover's recovery.

#### Notice the Groups.

Before proceeding to pair the cards, we may as well note the groups as
they have come out in the fifteen. The six diamonds point to there being
plenty of money; the two tens tell of a change of residence, either
brought about by marriage, or by the journey read in the ten of
diamonds; the presence of three knaves betokens false friends, though as
one is reversed, their power of doing harm is lessened; two queens
indicate gossip and the revealing of secrets; the two aces imply an
attempted plot, but it is frustrated by the one being reversed; the two
nines also point to riches.

#### How the Pairs Work Out.

The two end cards of the fifteen are taken up together, so that the
pairs shall work out thus:—The queen of diamonds and the nine of spades,
implying that sickness and trouble will affect the inquirer; the ten of
diamonds pairs with the ten of

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

hearts, and they signify a wedding; the knaves of diamonds and spades
coming together show evil intentions towards the inquirer; the king of
clubs and the ace of hearts tell of the lover and the love letter; the
inverted nine of diamonds pairing with the knave of spades, tells of a
love quarrel, in which a dark young man, wanting in refinement, is
concerned; the reversed seven of diamonds pairs with the knave of
hearts, also inverted, and tells of a foolish scandal instigated by the
ungallant soldier who is suffering from wounded vanity; the inverted ace
of diamonds comes out with the queen of hearts, telling of a letter
containing unpleasant news from a fair, good-natured woman; while the
remaining card, the ten of spades, being inverted, speaks of brief
sorrow for the inquirer.

#### The Five Packs.

Our next step is to deal out the five packs as already directed. The
first one—for *the lady herself*—contains three cards, two of which are
bad, but their harm is largely discounted by the ten of hearts. In the
nine of spades we read of the trouble caused by her lover's illness; the
ten of spades betokens the tears she will shed while the beloved life is
in danger; the ten of hearts speaks of happiness triumphing over sorrow.

The second pack—for *the house*—contains a flush of diamonds, the ten,
the ace, and the knave. There is plenty of money in the house: the ten
speaks of a journey, possibly resulting in a change of residence; the
ace, being reversed, tells of a letter on the way containing unpleasant
news (probably connected with the removal), from the knave, who is a
faithless friend, and is to blame for the annoyance.

The third pack—for *those who do not expect*—consists of three court
cards, which taken together foretell gaiety of some sort. We find the
inquirer, personated by the queen of diamonds, in the society of the
knaves of spades and hearts, the latter reversed, and consequently we
know that she will be troubled by some unfriendly schemes, in which the
dark, undesirable young man and the disappointed officer will be
concerned. The inversion of the one knave counteracts the intended harm.

The fourth pack—for *those who do expect*—contains the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

queen of hearts, the king of spades, and the seven of diamonds,
inverted. These indicate that the fair woman of gentle and affectionate
nature will be exposed to scandal, seven of diamonds reversed; through
the agency of the king of spades, an ambitious untrustworthy lawyer who
is her enemy.

The fifth pack, consisting of only two cards (the ace of hearts and the
nine of diamonds), is for *the surprise*, and we learn that a love
letter, the ace, will be delayed, the nine; but the consolation card is
the king of clubs, the dark, warm-hearted man, who will come in person
to his lady-love.

 

The above example has been taken in the plainest, most straightforward
manner with just the most apparent reading of the cards given as an
illustration of the method. Those who spend time and thought on the
subject will soon get to see more of the "true inwardness" of the cards
with respect to their relative positions, and their influence one upon
another. Various experiments with this plan of fortune-telling will give
rise to curious combinations, and perhaps startling developments, as the
one acting for the inquirer gains in knowledge and confidence.
