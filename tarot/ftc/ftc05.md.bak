### CHAPTER III

#### The Selected Pack of Thirty-two Cards

<span class="small">*Reduced pack generally used—How to indicate
reversed cards—Meaning of Hearts—Diamonds—Clubs—Spades*.</span>

#### Reduced Pack Generally Used.

THE practice of using only thirty-two cards in telling fortune is very
general, especially in those systems which have been adopted from or
based upon a foreign source. We here give the definitions used in these
methods, as they differ in certain respects from those given with the
entire pack of fifty-two cards. Special care must be taken when using
the selected pack to notice which way the cards come out upon the table,
whether upright or reversed, as the meanings of the two positions may be
diametrically opposed.

#### How to Indicate Reversed Cards.

In former days it was easier to distinguish between the top and the
bottom of a card, but now that they are practically made reversible,
with a few exceptions, it is necessary to mark the cards that are to be
used for fortune-telling in such a way as to enable the dealer to say at
a glance whether the card is reversed or not. These marks should be made
before the pack has been used, and need not be altered if the cards are
kept solely for this purpose.

In the following pages this selected pack is required for several
methods, and in the case of the Master Method it is augmented by the
four twos taken from the excluded cards.
