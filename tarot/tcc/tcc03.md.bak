# The Sun

The Sun card line art has an obvious glitch which appears in both the
Pamela A and US Games decks. This is an additional wavy line just to the
right of the Roman numeral XIX at the top of the card. This is a sure
sign that the two decks are essentially identical. If the US Games deck
was redrawn, this superfluous line would have raised the eyebrows of any
competent artist.

There *is* one difference in the line art on this card: note the break
in the Sun's left eyebrow in Pamela A--the left eyebrow line is solid in
the USGS deck. Whether this was introduced deliberately is up for
speculation.

It is worth taking a close look at some of the shading in the Pamela A
Sun card, particularly on the horse and the flag. This is washed-out in
the US Games version; there is a much better sense of depth in Pamela-A.
There also appear to be subtle variations in the skin tone of the baby
which are completely lost in the USGS version; again, this appears to be
the case on many of the other cards.
