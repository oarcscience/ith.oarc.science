3rd Hebrew letter (Gimel).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE THIRD CARD OF THE TAROT.

The hieroglyphic meaning of the letter Gimel is the throat, the hand of
man half closed in the act of prehension. Hence it signifies all that
incloses, all that is hollow, a canal, an inclosure. The throat is the
spot where the words conceived in the brain are formed, or I might
almost say embodied, therefore the Gimel is the symbol of the material
envelopment of spiritual forms, of organic generation under all its
forms, of all the ideas springing from the corporeal organs or their
actions.

Generation is the mystery by which the spirit unites itself to matter,
by which the Divine becomes Human.

The signification of Venus-Urania, to which this card corresponds, is
easily understood by the above explanations.

THE THIRD CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Empress.

This symbol would therefore signify ideas of generation, of embodiment
in all the worlds.

A woman seen full face.

The human being becomes corporeal in the womb of a woman.

This woman is represented with wings, or in the centre of a radiating
sun.

The idea of the spirituality of the vivifying Principle of all beings.

She holds an eagle in her right hand.

The eagle is the symbol of the soul and of life (Holy Spirit).

In the left hand she bears a sceptre forming the astrological sign of
Venus.

The sceptre is held in the *left* hand to indicate the *passive*
influence, which Nature, Venus-Urania, or the woman exercises in the
generation of beings.

She wears a crown with twelve points, or twelve stars.

The sign of the diffusion of the vivifying Principle through all the
worlds and of the sun, through the Zodiac.

The third card of the Tarot shows the result of the reciprocal action of
the two first terms neutralizing each other in one principle. It is the
*Neuter Element* of Wronski, the basis of every system of reality.

The absolute creative force, or Osiris, and the absolute preservative
force, or Isis, neutralize themselves in the

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

equilibrist force, which contains in itself the two very different
properties of the two first forms.

In God this would be the equilibrium of the Father and of the Son, or--

God the Holy Ghost  
HORUS  
The universal vivifying force.

In Man this would be the equilibrium of the Adam-Eve--

Adam-Eve  
Or HUMANITY.

In the Universe this would be the equilibrium of *Natura naturans* and
of *Natura naturata*--

THE WORLD  
Conceived like a being.

The creative principle and the receptive principle, having, by their
mutual action, given birth to the transforming principle, a complete
entity is created.

The term which now follows will correspond with the second he of the
sacred word, and will consequently indicate the passage from one series
to the other.
