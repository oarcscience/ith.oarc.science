10\. י

10th Hebrew letter (Yod).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE TENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The hieroglyphic meaning of the Yod is the finger of man; the forefinger
extended as a sign of command. This letter has therefore become the
image of potential manifestation, of spiritual duration; lastly of the
eternity of time, with all the ideas relating to it. <span

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

The Yod is a simple letter; astronomically it corresponds with the
zodiacal sign of the Virgin.

TENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Wheel of Fortune.

Two principal ideas are expressed by this symbol--

1\. The idea of Command, of Supremacy.

2\. The idea of the duration, of the eternal action of time.

The wheel of fortune suspended upon its axis. To the right *Anubis*, the
genius of good ascending; to the left *Typhon*, the genius of evil
descending, the *Sphinx* is balanced upon the centre of the wheel,
holding a sword in its lion claws.

The first idea is expressed by the ternary, Anubis or positive, Typhon
or negative, the balanced Sphinx the ruler.

The second idea is expressed by the wheel, a line without beginning or
end, the symbol of eternity.

The 10th arcanum is midway between the 7th and 13th arcana.

7 + 13 = 20   20/2 = 10.

It expresses the incessant equilibrium, which modifies the creative
realizations of the septenary by the necessary destruction by Death
(arcanum 13). The three arcana, 7, 10, 13, correspond exactly with the
*Hindu* trinity or *Trimurti*.

Brahma = Creator = Arcanum 7.

Siva = Destroyer = Arcanum 13.

Vishnu = Preserver = Arcanum 10.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

It represents the course of things according to the ternary law, which
directs all the divine manifestations.

The tenth card of the Tarot commences the negative portion of the 2nd
septenary, and expresses the notion of the septenary considered in its
reflections.

It will therefore represent--

1\. Reflex of will (see 4th arcanum).

NECESSITY.

The *Karma* of the Hindus.

2\. Reflex of power and of realization.

MAGIC POWER.

Fortune.

(To will.)

3\. Reflex of the universal soul.

FORCE POTENTIAL IN ITS MANIFESTATION.

The absolute creative force has varied successively in the universal
vivifying Fluid (4), and the astral Light (7); now it is represented by
force potential in its manifestation. We shall see this force fully
displayed in the following arcanum.
