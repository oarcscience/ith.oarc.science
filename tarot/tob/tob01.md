# PREFACE.

THE Tarot pack of cards, transmitted by the Gypsies from generation. to
generation, is the primitive book of ancient initiation. This has been
clearly demonstrated by Guillaume Postel, Court de Gébelin, Etteila,
Eliphas Levi, and J. A. Vaillant.

The key to its construction and application has not yet been revealed,
so far as I know. I therefore wished to fill up this deficiency by
supplying Initiates, i. e. those who are acquainted with the elements of
occult science, with an accurate guide, which would assist them in the
pursuit of their studies.

The uninitiated reader will find in it the explanation of the lofty
philosophy and science of ancient Egypt; whilst ladies are enabled to
practise the use of the divining Tarot, by methods which we have
rendered easy in Chapter XX.

The book has been so arranged that each part forms

a complete whole, which can, if necessary, be studied separately.

I have used every effort to be as clear as possible; the public that has
warmly welcomed my other books will, I hope, forgive the imperfections
inherent to a work of this kind.

PAPUS.
