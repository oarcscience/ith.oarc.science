11\. כ

11th Hebrew letter (Kaph).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ELEVENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The hieroglyphic meaning of the Kaph is the hand of man, half closed and
in the act of prehension, like the Gimel. But the Kaph is reinforcement
of the Gimel, so that we might say that it designates the hand of man in
the act of *grasping strongly*. Ideas of strength are therefore applied
to this letter.

The number 11, the first after the decade, gives a different value to
the Kaph, which designates a reflected transitory life, a. kind of
mould, which receives and restores every variety of form.

It is derived from the letter Heth, ח (8), which is itself derived from
the sign of absolute life, He ה (5). Thus, allied on one side to the
sign of elementary life (see the 8th arcanum), it joins to the
signification of the letter Heth (ה) that of the organic sign ג (Gimel)
(3rd arcanum), of which too it is merely a reinforcement.

The Kaph is a double letter, corresponding astronomically with March and
Tuesday.

THE ELEVENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

Strength.

Only two ideas are expressed by this arcanum--

1\. The idea of strength.

2\. The idea of vitality.

A young girl calmly closing a lion's mouth without any visible effort.

(First idea.)

This young girl wears the vital sign ∞ upon her head.

(Second idea.)

The 11th arcanum. is midway between the 8th and 14th arcana. In it we
find the symbolism of the 8th arcanum. transformed to the physical
plane. It is, in fact, the image of the power given by the sacred
science (2nd arcanum) when justly applied (8).

The eleventh card of the Tarot shows us all the negative or reflective
significations of the fifth, that is to say--

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

1\. Reflex of the Intelligence (5).

LIBERTY.

2\. Reflex of Authority, of Faith.

COURAGE.

(To dare.)

3\. Reflex of the Universal Life. Manifestation of the strength of the
preceding arcanum.

REFLECTED AND TRANSITORY LIFE.

11\. כ

Strength.

The strength, already potential in its manifestations, has shown its
full force in the 11th arcanum; it will balance itself in the following
arcanum.
