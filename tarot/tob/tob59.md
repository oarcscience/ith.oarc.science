# CHAPTER XXII.

### CONCLUSION.

HAVING reached the end of our journey we must cast one rapid glance over
the road we have followed, in order to give some account of the scope of
our work.

Seeing that materialistic science was giving way, in spite of the
desperate efforts of its partisans, under the irresistible pressure of
the new era, the impotence of purely analytical methods forced itself
upon us, and we were led to search for the possible basis of a synthesis
which each day renders more indispensable.

At this moment, the ancient wisdom revealed itself to our
investigations, and we find that it contains this synthetic method as
the immutable basis of all its scientific, religious, and social
discoveries.

The secret societies entrusted with the transmission of this sacred
deposit have lost its key as well as its ritual; the nomad Gypsies and
the Jews only have guarded their Bibles intact throughout the centuries:
the latter had the Sepher of Moses, the former the Tarot attributed to
Thoth Hermes Trismegistus, the triple hierarchic University of ancient
Egypt. <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md)

Tile Tarot appeared to us as the Egyptian translation of the book of
initiation, starting as the now missing key to Freemasonry and the whole
occult science.

How could we decipher this series of hieroglyphics? How discover. the
mysterious grouping of these plates, now become the accessory of
gamblers?

Wronski teaches us that the faculty to conceive implies the faculty to
execute. Strong in this truth, we have questioned antiquity. Its
Sphinxes, dumb to the profane, have spoken, its old temples have
unveiled their mysteries, its Initiates have re-awakened in answer to
our call: four mysterious letters have been revealed to us--

\[paragraph continues\] The sacred word, which shines above every
initiation, the object of the veneration and respect of all the sages.

The study of the Tarot has shown us that it only expresses the
combinations of IEVE. However, since we must in these questions guard
ourselves above all things from leaving too much scope to the
imagination, we have chosen as the starting-point for our studies a
fixed principle, as basis to these immutable combinations, the sole
guarantee against all possible error: the *number*.

We then approached the symbol, and there we again encountered new
difficulties. The history of the Tarot has shown us that its figures
have often changed in passing through the hands of various peoples, and
through different epochs, although its meaning has been preserved in all
times and in all places.

It was therefore necessary to find for the symbols a principle as fixed
and immutable in its combinations as the number. The study of the origin
of the letters used

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

to inscribe human languages led us back to the determination of the
sixteen primitive hieroglyphic signs, the source of the first alphabets.
The 22 Hebrew letters immediately derived from these signs furnished us
with this indispensable basis to all serious researches, as definitely
*fixed* for the *symbol*, as the numbers were for the whole Tarot. We
thus had a sure guide, which rendered error still more unlikely.

Thanks to the application of these principles, exact, although very
general, information was furnished to us upon *Theogony*, *Androgony*,
and *Cosmogony*, and we could at last recapitulate the symbolism of the
Tarot in a very interesting tableau. We then wished to show that the
Tarot was really the general key which we had pronounced it to be. A few
applications proved the fact. Astronomy is unquestionably the most
important amongst them through its fixed principles. Therefore, when we
wish to discover how an evolution *can advance*, and we wander in. the
labyrinth of inexactitude, Astronomy shows us how the evolution of the
sun *progresses*, and that knowledge gives us the key to every possible
evolution.

The gigantic labours of Dupuis were fruitless, because he did not
understand that the *solar Myth* was only a representation of the
*general law of evolution*, and not that of the especial evolution of
the sun. The method of occult science is neither induction nor
deduction, but analogy, an unknown method at the present date which the
Tarot reveals to us in all its splendour.

Afterwards we have made other applications of it, and could have made
still more; shown the key of Philosophy, of the Holy Kabbalah, of
Theosophy, of the Physiology of Man and of the Universe in the Tarot;
but we have

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

restricted ourselves to giving the key, and to showing the way to use it
by some examples.

We were unwilling to exceed the strict limits of our engagement.

Such as it is, our work still contains some imperfections which we would
willingly efface. We are under no illusions on this point, and time
alone can remedy it. But we would draw attention to the aim which is
visible throughout its pages; the application of the most exact methods
possible to occult science.

Through the modern exact sciences we have reached the study of
occultism, and starting ourselves from materialism, of which we were one
of the most ardent disciples, we felt the necessity of advancing
further. But we had retained one trace of our early affections, the
taste for method, and it is the absence of this method which spoils
occult science. Louis Lucas had clearly seen that physics must advance
by the side of metaphysics to serve as its basis: in the same way we
have endeavoured to place fixed principles, such as numbers and the
Hebrew letters, side by side with the metaphysical data, like the
symbols or abstract conceptions.

Occultists as a rule are lost through this lack of precision. We have
made every effort to avoid this stumbling-block, without however
asserting that we have succeeded. An author is not qualified to judge
his own work.

Be this as it may, we have been frequently obliged to speak of occult
science without the leisure to enter into these explanatory
details--this is the reason we addressed our book

TO INITIATES.

An Initiate is one who possesses the elements of occultism, and who is
therefore familiar with a whole vocabulary, which may well alarm a man
of the world; this is our excuse for words which may sound pretentious
to some minds, and this is why we were anxious to express our ideas
quite clearly.

Still, since it is customary for the Tarot to be used for
*fortune-telling*, we have touched upon this subject, and rendered it as
attractive as possible. We have tried to simplify the systems used, so
that a woman of even little intelligence can easily and with little
exercise of memory amuse herself with this art.

But since our own system may not please all the partisans of Cartomancy,
we have summed up the process of the great master *Etteila*, so that,
even in this purely empiric region, we have tried to introduce as much
scientific exactitude as possible.

We hope that this recapitulation of the efforts of several years may
prove useful to occultism, and to its revival, which becomes daily more
pronounced. This is the aim which we have kept in view. May the social
disorders which are preparing give rise to an era of peace and harmony
amongst the now divided nations, and may the knowledge of these
mysteries overthrow European Cæsarism in all its forms! This should be
your aim, Kabbalists, Theosophists, Martinists, Rosicrucians, and
Freemasons? On this point believe the humble disciple of your doctrines,
who will be only too happy if his work has retained one feeble ray of
the Eternal and Holy Truth.
