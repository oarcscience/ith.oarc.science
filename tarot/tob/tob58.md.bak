# CHAPTER XXI.

### APPLICATION OF THE TAROT TO GAMES.

The Royal Game of Human Life played by the Egyptians. The Unity of Games
in the Tarot.

THE ROYAL GAME OF HUMAN LIFE,

ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIANS.

1\. When the players have chosen their *Magian*, they also choose from
amongst the non-players a man and a woman, whom they name *Osiris* and
*Isis*.

2\. When commencing a game, the Magian having taken the central place,
the players settle the amount of the principal fine together (we will
suppose it to be one halfpenny), and a basket is placed on the table to
receive the money.

3\. When all the players axe seated, the Magian takes the Book of Thoth,
*i. e.* the pack of Tarot cards, and shuffles them, carefully placing
their heads alternate ways, but without looking at them, lets them be
cut by some player on his left, and then deals the cards to his right,
giving as many as he likes, up to seven, to each player and to himself

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

4\. Each player should notice that the top of the card (when the Magian
deals it) is facing his chest; it is therefore in that sense, and
according to the order in which the cards are dealt, that the players
should read the oracles traced upon it, which they refer to whomever
they choose amongst the persons in the house.

5\. When one of the players reads an oracle he assumes the character of
an *interpreter*, and if the person to whom he refers the oracle will
not give him a present, be must pay half the fine.

6\. When a person has received three veracious oracles upon the past,
the present, or according to probabilities the future, and he refuses to
reward the interpreter, the players will hold a council, and judge by a
majority of voices whether his refusal is justified or not. In the
latter case, the Magian must pronounce the word PAMENES, which warns all
the household that there is one person present who does not join in the
royal game of the Human Life, and then Osiris and Isis are obliged to
pay for him, for when they accepted these titles, they undertook to
diffuse peace and abundance over the heroes who are playing.

7\. When one of the spectators asks to buy the hand of one of the
players, the Magian fixes its price, which is divided into three parts:
the first third is paid into the fine-box; the second to the Magian; and
the third to the player, who however can avoid parting with his cards by
paying the two first thirds of the price fixed by the Magian.

8\. When one of the spectators has acquired the hand of one of the
players, he takes with it all the player's chances of fines and
presents.

9\. When one of the players cannot read the oracles, he

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

places his seven cards on one side and pays one-fourth of the fine.

10\. If the player, although able to read the oracle, cannot find any
one to whom he can refer it, he must lay his cards upon the table, face
upwards, and read the meaning that he sees in them, without paying
anything. If, on the other hand, he interprets them badly, according to
the judgment of the other players, the Magian condemns him to pay half
the fine.

11\. When the interpreter has pronounced the oracle, aloud or privately,
and has received a present, he can have his seven cards re-shuffled by
the Magian, who will return them to him to cut; and finally, if the same
cards produce three presents from the same or other persons to whom the
oracles have been uttered, all the players, except the Magian, give the
interpreter three times the value of the fine. This is the civic crown.

12\. The Magian arranges and directs the games as he likes; he awards
the fines according to the nature of the faults, such as showing the
cards to other players, biding them from the spectators, any
indiscretion in the utterance of the oracles, reading oracles which are
not justified by the cards, etc.

13\. The spectators can join in the game until the Magian indicates that
it will soon end, by saying in a quarter of an hour, or half an hour,
the game will close.

14\. If the Magian should forget to announce the coming end of the game,
all the spectators have a right to share the fines, which are divided
equally amongst all the players, when the expenses have been paid.

THE UNITY OF GAMES.

Is it not true that man has displayed more inventive faculties to
satisfy his vices, than for anything, else? To convince ourselves of
this fact we need only look at the innumerable inventions destined to
aid him in losing the time which has been so parsimoniously dealt out to
us all.

But the human brain acts in accordance with a very small number of laws,
and the inventor cannot escape from the effect of this rule. Look at the
basis of most games, however they may differ in appearance. Is it not
possible to find one single game, from which most of the others are
derived?

Follow me in thought, dear reader, over one of the high-roads of Spain
or Italy, and let us ask some old Gypsy to leave her camp for a moment
and tell our fortunes. Look at the strange cards she draws from her
greasy bag: the Universe, the Sun, the Stars, Death, Fortune, Love, are
only a few of the names of these eccentric figures, which depict the
phases of our daily life with so much simplicity. What is this game? The
Gypsy Tarot.

It is composed of our cards with four additional figures called Knights,
who are placed between the Queen and the Knave. But its originality lies
in the twenty-two supplementary and symbolical figures. Each of them
represents an image, a number, an idea. Court de Gébelin, a savant of
the eighteenth century, has shown us that this game, as possessed by the
Gypsies, is of Egyptian origin, that it also existed in China and India
from the earliest antiquity, and we shall see that it is the father of
most of the games now known.

It is composed of numbers and figures, which mutually react upon and
explain each other. But if we separate

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

the figures and arrange them upon a paper in the form of a wheel, making
the numbers move in the shape of dice, we produce the *Goose game*, with
which Ulysses, according to Homer, practised cheating beneath the walls
of Troy.

If we fix the numbers upon alternate black and white squares, and allow
the lesser figures of our game to move upon them--the King, Queen,
Knight, Foolish Man or Knave, Tower or ace--we have the *Game of Chess*.
In fact, the primitive chessboards bore numbers, and philosophers used
them to solve problems of logic.

If, leaving the figures on one side, we confine ourselves to the use of
numbers, the *Game of Dice* appears, and if we weary of throwing the
dice, we can mark the characters upon horizontal plates and create the
*Game of Dominoes*.

If the symbolical figures are in our way, we replace them by black and
white draughts, and by using the numbers upon the dice we invent
*Backgammon*, another combination of the *Goose game*.

Chess degenerates in the same way into the *Game of Draughts*.

Lastly, our *pack of cards*, instead of first appearing under Charles X,
according to the common report, is of far older date. Spanish
regulations are in existence dated long before this reign, forbidding
the nobles to play at cards, and the Tarot itself is of very ancient
origin.

The sceptres of the Tarot have become clubs, the cups hearts, the swords
spades, and the pentacles or money diamonds. We have also lost the
twenty-two symbolical figures and the four knights.

But if all these games are derived from the Tarot, what is its origin
and its primitive derivation?

These are grave questions, which for their solution lead the mind into
dangerous researches. Let me

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

therefore relate to you a certain confidence upon this subject which I
received from a dusty old manuscript, forgotten in a corner of a
library. Take it as romance or as history, whichever you like, it does
not matter so long as your curiosity is gratified.

Now, let us transport ourselves in imagination three thousand miles
away, into the midst of the wonderful and grandiose Egyptian
civilization, which archæologists are each day revealing more fully to
our century.

Let us enter one of those cities, of which Paris would form but one
district, passing through the defensive outworks guarded by a
well-equipped body of soldiers, and glide amongst the inhabitants, who
are as numerous and as busy as those of our greatest cities.

On all sides immense monuments of strange architecture rise to enormous
heights; the terraces of rich houses indicate the first steps of a
gigantic staircase, formed by the palaces and temples, and dominated by
the silent residence of the supreme head of the Empire.

The great cities are everywhere fortified, the Nile is restrained by
moles, and enormous reservoirs are ready to receive its surplus waters,
and thus transform terrible inundations into beneficent irrigation.

All this involves science and savants, but where are they?

At this epoch science and religion were blended in a single study, and
all the men of science, engineers, doctors, architects, superior
officers, scribes, etc., were called *priests* or *Initiates*. We must
not confuse the priest of antiquity with the word taken in the modern
sense, or we shall fall into many errors, amongst others that of
believing that Egypt was given over to clerical despotism in its worst
form.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

Instruction of every kind was given in the temples in various degrees,
according to methods perfectly established, and, at that epoch, imitated
in every country in the world.

The highest instruction which man can acquire was given in the great
temple of Egypt, and it was there that the great reformers of the future
completed their studies: Orpheus, Lycurgus, Pythagoras, and Moses
amongst many others.

Astronomy was one of the sciences which became the object of constant
investigation. We now know through Pythagoras, who has perpetuated the
knowledge of the wise men of Egypt, that they were acquainted with the
movement of the earth round the sun, as well as with the position of the
latter in relation to its satellite planets. Many of the mythological
stories relate to these mysteries and the wise men of the epoch, that is
to say, the priests taught astronomy to their disciples, by means of
small cards, which represented the months, seasons, signs of the zodiac,
planets, sun, etc., etc. In this way they imprinted upon the imagination
of the students the data which later on they verified in nature.

A time followed when Egypt, no longer able to struggle against her
invaders, prepared to die honourably. Then the Egyptian savants (at
least so my mysterious informant asserts) held a great assembly to
arrange how the knowledge, that until that date had been confined to men
judged worthy to receive it, should be saved from destruction.

At first they thought of confiding these secrets to virtuous men
secretly recruited by the Initiates themselves, who would transmit them
from generation to generation. But one priest, observing that virtue is
a most fragile thing, and most difficult to find, at all events

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

in a continuous line, proposed to confide the scientific traditions to
vice.

The latter, he said, would never fail completely, and through it we are
sure of a long and durable preservation of our principles.

This opinion was evidently adopted, and the game chosen as a vice was
preferred. The small plates were then engraved with the mysterious
figures which formerly taught the most important scientific secrets, and
since then the players have transmitted this Tarot from generation to
generation, far better than the most virtuous men upon earth would have
done.

Such is the story or the history confided to me by this old manuscript,
upon the origin of the father of our great games, and I am very glad
that it provided me with the means of proving my perhaps paradoxical
assertion of their original unity.
