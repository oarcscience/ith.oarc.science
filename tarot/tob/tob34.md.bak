18th Hebrew letter (Tzaddi).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE EIGHTEENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The hieroglyphic idea connected with the Tzaddi is the same as that of
the Teth (9th card); but it chiefly signifies a *term*, an aim, an end.
It is a final concluding sign, relating to all the ideas of term, of
secession, division and aim. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md)

The Tzaddi is a simple letter; it corresponds with the zodiacal sign of
Aquarius.

THE EIGHTEENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Moon.

We have now traversed the steps which the spirit descends in its gradual
and utter fall towards the material world. All is now ended; the spirit
is completely materialized, and the change is indicated by the
eighteenth card.

A meadow feebly lighted by the moon.

The light, the symbol of the soul, no longer reaches us directly; the
material world is only lighted by *reflection*.

The meadow is bounded by a tower on each side. Drops of blood are
falling from the moon.

The material world is the last point which the spirit can reach, it can
descend no lower; this is shown by the boundaries of the field. The
drops of blood represent the descent of the Spirit into Matter.

A path sprinkled with drops of blood loses itself in the horizon. In the
centre of the field a dog and a wolf axe howling at the moon, a crayfish
is climbing out of the water between the two animals.

The entry of the Spirit into Matter is so great a fall that everything
conspires to augment it.

Servile spirits (the dog), savage souls (the wolf), and crawling
creatures (the crayfish) are all present watching the fall of the soul,
hoping to aid in its destruction.

Involution, that is to say, the descent of the Spirit into Matter, ends
with the 3rd septenary.

The three last cards of the Tarot will show us how all the emanated
forces gradually return to their common principle by *evolution*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_62"></span>[174:1](tob34.htm#fr_62.md) Placed at the
commencement of a word it indicates the movement which leads towards the
end; placed at the end it marks the term itself to which it has tended;
it then receives this form, ץ. It is derived from the letter Samech ס
(15) and the letter Zain ז (7), and it marks the secession of one or the
other.
