# THIRD LESSON.

### MAJOR ARCANA. SIGNIFICATION FROM THE DIVINING POINT OF VIEW.

WE now know the signification of the minor arcana, and need only study
the major arcana.

As we have already stated, the major arcana consist of 22 symbolical
cards, which we have not yet examined as a means of predicting the
future.

Their meaning is very easy to remember, if any one will take the trouble
to consider them carefully one by one, as their signification is
described.

One general rule will also aid the memory in this matter, that is, that
the seven first cards chiefly refer to the intellectual side of man, the
seven next to his moral side, and the seven last to the various events
of his material life.

We will now give the signification of these 22 cards of our Tarot--
