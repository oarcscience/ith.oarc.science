8th Hebrew letter (Heth).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE EIGHTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

Hieroglyphically the Heth expresses a field. From it springs the idea of
anything that requires labour, trouble, an effort.

Continued effort results in the establishment of an equilibrium, between
the destruction of the works of man accomplished by nature, when left to
herself, and the preservation of this work. Hence the idea of *balancing
power*, and consequently of Justice attributed to this letter. <span

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Astronomically the Heth corresponds to the sign of Cancer in the zodiac.

THE EIGHTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

Justice.

The ideas expressed by this symbol are of *Equilibrium* in all its
forms.

A woman seen full face, and wearing an iron coronet, is seated upon a
throne. She is placed between the two columns of the temple. The solar
cross is traced upon her breast.

Here we find the continuation of the symbolism of the 2nd and 5th
arcana. The Seated woman occupies the Centre between the columns, the
first idea of the equilibrium between Good and Evil.

She holds a sword, point upwards, in her right hand, and a balance in
her left.

Occult science (2), at first theoretical, has become practical (5), and
has been taught verbally. Now it appears in all the pitilessness of
consequences, terrible for the false Magi (the Sword), but just toward
the true Initiates (Balance). The signification of this arcanum is
central between the 5th (ה He) and the 11th (כ Kaph) arcana.

This card is the complement of the eleventh, as the fifth was of the
second. In the 1st septenary all the cards which, by addition, formed
the number 7, completed each other; in the 2nd septenary all the cards
which, added together, form 19, act in the same way.

The elementary existence is the means by which the astral vivifying
fluid or astral light (7) manifests itself through the ether or astral
matter (9). This is demonstrated by the following arcanum.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[138:1](tob22.htm#fr_60) This letter, an
intermediary between ה (He) and כ (Kaph), the one designating life,
absolute existence, the other the relative life, assimilated existence,
is the sign of elementary existence: it is the image of a kind of
equilibrium, and attaches itself to ideas of effort, of labour, and of
normal and legislative action.--FABRE D'OLIVET.
