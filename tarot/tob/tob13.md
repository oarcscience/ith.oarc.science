THE FIRST CARD OF THE TAROT.

ORIGIN OF THE SIGNIFICATION OF ALL THE OTHERS.

We see from our preceding work that if we know the exact meaning of the
first card of the Tarot we can, from that, discover the signification of
all the others.

We cannot approach this subject without great hesitation. The hope of
ascertaining the truth is, in fact, troubled by the possibility of
making a mistake which might have very serious results.

The work which we have already accomplished will, however, enable us to
decipher the meaning of the symbolism of the first card of the Tarot
almost mathematically, but the general meaning only; whilst we know that
each card must have not one, but three meanings.

We must discover three sufficiently general principles to be applied to
every order of human knowledge; for this should be the object of the
Tarot.

In this case we will, as usual, resort to those eminent authors who have
treated these questions from different points of view, and the agreement
between their teachings will give us new light to illuminate our path.

The Pole HŒNÉ WRONSKI, <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) who died of
hunger in the suburbs of Paris, was perhaps one of the most powerful
intellects produced by the 19th century. He asserted that he had
discovered the formula of the absolute, and his works are unquestionably
a summary of one of the most elevated syntheses that we have ever seen.
We need not discuss the doctrines of Wronski, but will only say a few
words upon the three primitive elements which enter into his law of
creation.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Wronski places at the origin of all creation three elements, which he
designates by the names--

Of Neuter Element (E. N.)  
Of Element of Being (E. B.)  
Of Element of Wisdom (E. W.)

The Neuter Element represents the Absolute, Reality resulting from the
total neutralization of the two other elements by each other.

The Element of Wisdom represents the CREATIVE FACULTY with its especial
characteristics, autogeny and spontaneity.

The Element of Being represents the PERMANENT FACULTY with its
characteristics, autothesis and inertia.

Principle of the Creation or Element of Wisdom.  
Principle of Preservation or Element of Being.  
Principle of Neutralization or Neuter Element.

These are the three terms upon which Wronski establishes the foundations
of Reality, and, consequently, of all the systems of creation. We must
remember these conclusions.

FABRE D'OLIVET, in his researches upon the first principles which direct
everything, <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) determines the existence
of three elements, which he names Providence, Destiny, and Human Will.

Providence is the principle of ABSOLUTE LIBERTY, of the creation of
beings and things.

Destiny is the principle of ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, of the preservation of
beings and of things.

Lastly, the *Human Will* is a neuter principle intermediate between the
two: the principle of mobility and CHANGE, in all their forms. Now it is
not necessary to be

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

very learned to perceive the absolute agreement which exists between the
two authors; the one, Wronski, reached his conclusions by mathematics,
the other, d'Olivet, attained his by profound study of antiquity and its
mysteries. The words used may vary, but the idea is fundamentally the
same.

Wronski's Element of Wisdom (E. W.), the *principle of the creation*, is
the same thing as the Providence of d'Olivet, who thus places it as the
principle of the creation.

Wronski's Element of Being (E. B.), the *principle of the permanent
faculty*, exactly represents what d'Olivet calls Destiny, and which he
concludes to be the principle of preservation.

Lastly, d'Olivet's human Will corresponds in all points with Wronski's
Neuter Element.

Here then are two very different systems, which lead to the same
signification. But our conclusions do not stop here.

If we study these three primitive principles more attentively we shall
find in the first: Providence or the Element of Wisdom, represented in
philosophy by the word *God*.

Destiny or Being shows us its identity with the immutable laws which
govern the *Universe*.

Lastly, it does not require much study to prove to its that the human
Will responds to Man.

GOD, MAN, AND THE UNIVERSE.

This is the basis of all the esoteric philosophy of the ancients, and
not only Wronski and Fabre d'Olivet agree in their conclusions
respecting this mysterious ternary;

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

occult science itself proclaims its identity with these principles by
the mouth of all its disciples. *Hermes Trismegistus*, the *Holy
Kabbalah*, *Neo-Platonicism*, and the *Alchemists* through *Pythagoras*
and all the Greek philosophers assert the division of the Great All into
THREE ENTITIES OR WORLDS.

In less remote ages *Guillaume Postel* <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) gives the key of the Tarot without
explaining it, and the basis of this key is formed by this mysterious
entity--

DEUS, HOMO, ROTA.

Trithemie and his pupil *Cornelius Agrippa* <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) also give us this fecund and sublime
trinity in all their analogical figures.

The Jesuit *Kircher* <span id="fr_53"></span>[3](#fn_53.md) describes this
division into three worlds as the basis of the Egyptian mysteries.

Lastly, *Claude de Saint-Martin* has written a book entirely based upon
the keys of the Tarot, and it is entitled--*Tableau Naturel des rapports
qui unissent* DIEU, L'HOMME, ET L'UNIVERS.

Let us question India upon the law of the absolute, she replies--

Trimurti: BRAHMA, SIVA, VISHNU.

Let us ask China for the great secret of her philosophy, and she will
give us the *Tri-grams of Fo-Hi*.

Address ourselves to one of the ancient initiated Egyptians, he will
tell us--

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

OSIRIS, ISIS, HORUS.

The founder of *Greek Cosmogony*, the disciple of the science of Egypt,
*Hesiod*, also transmits this law to us, and they all confirm Louis
Lucas when he states: <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) "I feel that
hidden beneath this mystical formula of the Trinity is one of the most
important scientific laws that man has ever discovered."

God, Man, and the Universe, these are the most general principles that
we can attain, and they constitute the three meanings of the first card
of the Tarot.

It remains for us to ascertain first, whether these meanings respond to
the primitive hieroglyphic, and then to determine bow far they extend
through the whole Tarot.
