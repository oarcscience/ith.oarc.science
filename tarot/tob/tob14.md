1\. א

1st Hebrew letter (Aleph).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE FIRST CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Aleph hieroglyphically expresses *Man* himself as a collective
unity, the master principle, ruler of the earth.

From this hieroglyphic meaning are derived ideas of the *Unity* and of
the *principle which determines it*, ideas which give to Aleph its value
as the sign of Power and Stability.

Man, or the Microcosm, the Unity and the Principle in all the worlds, is
the meaning of the primitive hieroglyphic, which, as we see, exactly
renders the general ideas which we have established.

But attentive consideration of this first card of the Tarot will
enlighten us still further.

Symbolism of the First Card of the Tarot.

THE JUGGLER.

If you take the first card of the Tarot and examine it attentively, you
will see that the form of the juggler depicted upon it corresponds in
all points with that of the letter Aleph. If we now apply to the study
of this card the principles of the elucidation of symbolism, according
to the *Traité Élémentaire de Science Occulte*, we at once find new
explanations of it.

The top of the figure is occupied by the divine sign of Universal Life ∞
placed upon the head of the Juggler.

The bottom of the figure represents the Earth ornamented with its
productions, the symbol of Nature.

Lastly, the centre is occupied by the Man himself, placed behind a table
covered with divers objects.

The right and left of the figure are occupied by the hands of the
Juggler, one of them bent towards the Earth, the other raised towards
Heaven.

The position of the bands represents the two principles, active and
passive, of the Great All, and it corresponds with the two columns
*Jakin* and *Bohas* of the temple of Solomon and of Freemasonry.

Man with one hand seeks for God in heaven, with the other he plunges
below, to call up the demon to himself, and thus unites the divine and
the diabolic in humanity. In this way the Tarot shows us the *rôle* of
universal mediator accorded to the Adam-Kadmon.

If we wish to make a summary of the meaning of the symbol, so far as we
have now deciphered it, we can represent it in this way--

Yet the symbolism of this first card of the Tarot does not end here.

The Juggler holds the wand of the Mage in the left hand, which he
raises, and the four great symbols of the Tarot are placed before him.

The Cup, the Sword, the Pentacles or Talisman, which, as we have already
seen, exactly correspond with the letters of the Tetragrammaton--

Sceptre or Yod, symbol of the active Principle preeminent, and of God.

Cup or He, symbol of the passive Principle pre-eminent, or of the
Universe.

Sword, Cross or Vau, symbol of the Equilibrist Principle pre-eminent, or
of Man.

Pentacles or 2nd He, the cyclic symbol of Eternity, which unites the
three first Principles in one Whole.

From the human point of view these symbols correspond with the four
great human castes.

The men of Yod, or the Inventors, the Producers. The Nobility of
Intellect.

The men of He, or the depositaries of the great truths discovered by the
men of Yod: the Savants, the Judges. Professional nobility.

The men of Vau, or the guardians and defenders of the former: the
Warriors. Nobility of the sword.

The men of the 2nd He, the multitude from which the other classes are
continually recruited: the People.

 

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

The four great symbols are placed upon the table at random, and Man
rules them and must arrange them; in the twenty-first arcana we shall
find these symbols arranged in a cross.

We already know that the first card of the Tarot is completed by the
twenty-first (21 + 1 = 22), and we see why, if this first card
represents *Microcosm*, the last would represent *Macrocosm*, and the
eleventh card, which serves as the universal link to all the complements
of the Tarot, represents the *Vital reflex Current*, which serves as a
link between the worlds.

But we must not anticipate, so we will return to our first arcanum.

This symbol is the first of the whole Tarot, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) and it bears the Unity as its
characteristic number.

The Unity-principle, the origin of which is impenetrable to human
conceptions, is placed at the beginning of all things. We cannot seize
the origin of this primal cause, which we are content to assert
according to the absolute law of analogies so well expressed by Eliphas
Levi--

 

"Je crois *à l'inconnu* que Dieu *personnifie*,  
Prouvé par l'être même et par l'immensité,  
*Ideál* SURHUMAIN de la philosophie,  
Parfaite Intelligence et Suprême Bonté." <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md)

 

If we cannot follow this Unknown in its principle, it is

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

at least easy to us to follow it in its consequences, and therefore our
study will be only the development of the Unity-principle in creation,
related according to the Cosmogony of ancient initiation.

God, *Man*, and the *Universe* are, then, the three meanings of our
first card, and we will now say a few words upon the application of
these data to all the other cards of the pack.

EXTENSION OF THE THREE GREAT PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE TAROT.

The three meanings of the first card respectively represent--

The Creator or *Yod*.  
The Receiver or *He*.  
The Transformer or *Vau*.

Lastly, the transition to the second *He*, which is not under
consideration at present.

But the first card of the Tarot, taken *as a whole*, represents the
*Creator or Yod*, the second card taken as a whole will therefore
represent the *Receiver or He*, and the third the *Transformer or Vau*.
Each of them will also show the four aspects of *Yod-he-vau-he* in the
idea which it expresses.

But what is true of the ternary, is also true of the Septenary, so that
the first Septenary, taken as a whole, will represent the CREATOR.

The second septenary will represent the RECEIVER.

The third the TRANSFORMER.

Lastly, the ternary of transition will. represent the return of effects
to causes, and of consequences to the principle.

Let us condense this all by saying--

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

|                  |            |               |
|------------------|------------|---------------|
| 1st *septenary*  | represents | God.          |
| 2nd *septenary*  | ----       | Man.          |
| 3rd *septenary*  | ----       | the Universe. |

 

Moreover, each of these elements is contained in the two others in all
points of their manifestations.

GENERAL RECAPITULATION.

We have now to recapitulate all the acceptations of the first card in a
general figure. As each card in the Tarot will have the same
recapitulation, we think it may be useful to explain the scheme followed
in this arrangement. At the head of the figure will be found the Hebrew
number and letter of the card. Below it, the name usually given to the
card in the Tarot.

To the right of the figure are the significations in the Three Worlds:
Divine, Human, and Natural.

Below these three significations is found the absolute key to each card,
according to the figure of the revolutions of the word *Yod-he-vau-he*.
The Hebrew letters placed upon the upper line of this key indicate the
origin of the card under consideration, the Hebrew letters placed above
it indicate the exact meaning of the card.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_55"></span>[108:1](tob14.htm#fr_55.md) It is curious to
notice, when examining the position of the hands of the personages in
the Tarot of Marseilles, how often this position represents the
alphabetical letter to which the figure corresponds, according to
Barrois (system of dactylology or primitive language). The arcana 1, 2
and 5 are especially noticeable in this respect.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[108:2](tob14.htm#fr_56.md)

"I believe in *the unknown*, which God *personifies*,  
Proved by existence itself and by immensity,  
SUPERHUMAN *Ideal* of all philosophy,  
Perfect Intelligence and Supreme Benignity."

<span id="fn_57"></span>[111:1](tob14.htm#fr_57.md) According to Spinoza
the only free cause and substance of all modes or phenomena, conscious
and unconscious, past, present, and to come. \[A. P.M.\]
