9\. ט

9th Hebrew letter (Teth).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE NINTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

Hieroglyphically the Teth represents a roof, and suggests the idea of a
place of safety, a protection. All the ideas arising from this letter
are derived from the alliance of safety and protection given by wisdom.

Astronomically the Teth corresponds with the zodiacal Sign of the Lion.

NINTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Hermit.

The following ideas are connected with this card--

1\. Protection.

2\. Wisdom, Circumspection.

 

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

An old man walking supported by a stick. He carries before him a lighted
lamp, half hidden by the great mantle which envelopes him.

This symbol is midway between the sixth and the twelfth.

Protection is indicated by the mantle which envelops the old man.

Wisdom by the half-hidden lamp.

The stick indicates that the Sage is always armed to fight against
Injustice or Error.

By comparing this card with two others, the sixth and the twelfth, we
shall see that the beardless young man in the former (6th) has chosen
the right path. Experience won in the labour of life has rendered him a
prudent old man, and prudence united to wisdom will safely lead him to
the higher level, which he is anxious to attain (12th card).

The arrow shot by the genius in the sixth arcanum has become his
support, and the effulgent aureole which surrounded the genius is now
imprisoned in the lamp which guides the Initiate. This is the result of
his prolonged efforts.

The ninth card of the Tarot represents the third conceived as preserver
and recipient. It also balances the seventh and the eighth.

1\. Humanity fulfilling the function of God the Holy Spirit.

The human creative force.

HUMAN LOVE.

The preserving power of Humanity. The equilibrium of the Father and the
Mother.

2\. Equilibrium of Realization and Justice.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

PRUDENCE.

(Silence.)

3\. Nature accomplishing the function of humanity. Equilibrium of the
Astral Light and Elementary Existence.

THE NATURAL PRESERVING FORCE.

The Astral Fluid.

9\. ט

The Hermit.

The astral fluid therefore represents the universal preservation of the
active forces in nature. Here ends the first ternary of the septenary of
Preservation. We shall now see the reflections of all these terms in the
following ternary.
