17\. פ

17th Hebrew letter (Phe).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SEVENTEENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Phe expresses the same hieroglyphic meaning as the Beth (2nd card),
but in a more *extended* sense. For, whilst the Beth signifies the mouth
of man as the organ of speech, the Phe represents the produce of that
organ: Speech.

It is the sign of speech and of all connected with it. The *Word in
action* in nature with all its consequences.

Astronomically this letter responds to Mercury the God of Speech and of
scientific or commercial diffusion, the God of Universal exchange
between all beings and all worlds.

Phe is a double letter.

SEVENTEENTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Star.

The ideas expressed by this symbol are those--

1\. Of the expansion of fluids.  
2. Of their eternal renewal.

A nude female figure pours the Water of Universal Life from two cups.

The genius of the Sun (14th arcanum) has now descended to earth under
the form of this young girl, the image of eternal Youth. The fluids,
which she formerly poured from one vase to the other, she now throws
upon the ground (first idea).

This young girl is crowned with seven stars; in the midst of them shines
a very large and brilliant one. Near her an ibis (or sometimes a
butterfly) rests upon a flower.

Here we find the symbol of immortality. The soul (ibis or butterfly)
will survive the body, which is only a place of trial (the ephemeral
flower). The courage to bear these trials will come from above (the
stars).

The fall of the Divine and of the Human into the Material has scarcely
taken place, when a mysterious voice whispers, courage to the Sinner, by
showing him future re-instatement through trial.

This card exactly balances the evil effects of the preceding one, and
from it we derive the following significations--

1\. *Opposition to destruction*. No destruction is final. Everything is
eternal and immortal in God--

IMMORTALITY.

Creation of the human soul.

2\. The fall is not irreparable. This is whispered to us by the
intuitive sentiment we name

HOPE.

3\. The Visible Universe contains the source of its Divinization in
itself. This is

THE FORCE WHICH DISPENSES THE ESSENCE OF LIFE,

which gives it the means of perpetually renewing its creations after
destruction.

17\. פ
