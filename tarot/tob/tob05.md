# CHAPTER III.

### THE ESOTERISM OF NUMBERS.

The Theosophic Numbers and Operations--Signification of the Numbers.

THE NUMBERS.

THE ancients had a conception of numbers which is almost lost in modern
times.

The idea of the Unity in all its manifestations led to numbers being
considered as the expression of absolute laws. This led to the
veneration expressed for the 3 or for the 4 throughout antiquity, which
is so incomprehensible to our mathematicians.

It is however evident that if the ancients had not known how to work any
other problems than those we now use, nothing could have led them to the
ideas we find current in the Hindu, Egyptian, and Greek
Universities. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

What then are these operations, that our savants do not know?

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

They are of two kinds: theosophic reduction and theosophic addition.

These operations are theosophic because they cause *the essential laws*
of nature to penetrate throughout the world; they cannot be included in
the science of phenomena, for they tower above it, soaring into the
heights of pure intellectuality.

They therefore formed the basis of the secret and oral instruction
confided to a few chosen men, under the name of *Esoterism*.

1\. *Theosophic Reduction*.

Theosophic reduction consists in reducing all the numbers formed of two
or several figures to the number of a single figure and this is done by
adding together the figures which compose the number, until only one
remains.

 

EXAMPLE:

10 = 1 + 0 = 1

11 = 1 + 1 = 2

12= 1 + 2 = 3

126 = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9

2488 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 = 22 = 2 + 2= 4

 

This operation corresponds to that which is now called the *proof by* 9.

2\. *Theosophic Addition*.

Theosophic addition consists in ascertaining the theosophic value of a
number, by adding together arithmetically all the. figures from the
unity to itself inclusively.

Thus the figure 4, in theosophic addition, equals all

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

the figures from 1 to 4 inclusively added together, that is to say, 1 +
2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

The figure 7 equals--

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 = 2 + 8 = 10.

Theosophic reduction and addition are the two operations which it is
indispensable to know, if we would understand the secrets of
antiquity. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

Let us now apply these rules to all the numbers, that we may discover
the law which directs their progression.

Theosophic reduction shows us, first of all, that all numbers, whatever
they may be, are reducible in themselves to the nine first, since they
are all brought down to numbers *of a single figure*.

But this consideration is not sufficient, and *theosophic addition* will
now furnish us with new light.

Through it we find that 1, 4, 7, 10 are equal to 1.

for: 1 = 1

     4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 1

     7 = 1 +2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 = 10= 1

     10 = 1

So that all the three numbers ultimately return to the figure 1, thus--

|           |                 |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1.  2.  3 | 4.   5.   6     |
| 4 =10 =1  | 7 = 28 = 10 = 1 |

 

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Or one could write--

1\. 2. 3

\(1\)

4\. 5. 6

(1), etc.

The results of this consideration are: (1) That all the numbers in their
evolution, reproduce the 4 first;

\(2\) That the last of these 4 first, the figure 4, represents the unity
at a different octave.

The sequence of the numbers may therefore be written in this way--

|      |             |     |
|------|-------------|-----|
| 1\.  | 2\.         | 3   |
| 4\.  | 5\.         | 6   |
| 7\.  | 8\.         | 9   |
| 10\. | 11\.        | 12  |
| 13\. | 14\.        | 15  |
| 16\. | 17\.        | 18  |
| 19   | ........... |     |

 

We may notice that 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, etc., are only *different
conceptions* of the unity, and this may be proved by the application of
theosophic addition and reduction thus--

 

1 = 1

4= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 = 1

7 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 = 10 = 1

10 = 1

13 = 4 = 10 = 1

16 = 7 = 28= 10 = 1

19 = 10 = 1, etc., etc.

 

We see that in every three numbers the series reverts to the unity
abruptly, whilst it returns to it progressively in the two intermediate
numbers.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

Let us now repeat that the knowledge of the laws of numbers and the
study of them, made as we have here indicated, will give the key to all
occult science.

We must now sum up all the preceding statements in the following
conclusion: that all numbers may be reduced, in a final analysis, to the
series of the 4 first, thus arranged--

 

1\. 2. 3  
4

 

THE SIGNIFICATION OF NUMBERS.

But our knowledge of the numerical science of the ancients does not end
here. It also attributed a meaning to each number.

Since we have reduced the series of all the numbers to the 4 first, it
will suffice for us to know the meaning attributed to these 4 first.

The Unity represents the creative principle of all numbers, since the
others all emanate from it; it is the active principle pre-eminent.

But the Unity alone cannot produce anything except by opposing itself to
itself thus 1/1. From this proceeds duality, the principle of opposition
represented by two, the passive principle pre-eminent.

From the union of the Unity and Duality proceeds the third principle,
which unites the two opposites in one common neutrality, 1 + 2 = 3.
Three is the neuter principle pre-eminent.

But these three principles all reduce themselves into

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

the fourth, which merely represents a new acceptation of the Unity as an
active principle. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

The law of these principles is therefore as follows--
