5\. ה

5th Hebrew letter (He).

ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOLISM OF THE FIFTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The hieroglyphic meaning of He is aspiration, breath. It is by
aspiration that life is incessantly maintained and created. Hence
springs the idea of *all that animates* attributed to He.

But life specializes the being, by rendering it different from any
other; hence the idea of the being itself attributed to this letter.

However, the action of life does not stop here. It is also the mediating
principle, which attaches the material body to the divine spirit, in the
same way that man unites God and Nature; life is to the man (*aleph*)
what man is to the universe, pre-eminently the mediate principle.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Here we find the origin of the ideas of *bond*,
of the reunion of opposing principles, of religion, attributed to He.

This letter is simple; astronomically it corresponds with the igneous
sign of the Ram, which it explains.

THE FIFTH CARD OF THE TAROT.

The Pope.

This symbol expresses the following ideas--

(1st) Idea of Life, of animation,  
(2nd) Idea of Being,  
(3rd) Idea of Reunion.

The Initiate of the mysteries of Isis is seated between the two columns
of the sanctuary. He leans upon a triple cross, and makes the sign of
Esoterism with his left hand.

The triple Cross represents the triple *Lingam* of Indian theogony; that
is to say, the penetration of the creative power throughout the Divine,
the Intellectual, and the Physical Worlds, which causes all the
manifestations of universal life to appear (first idea).

The two columns symbolize: on the right, the Law; on the left, the
Liberty to obey and to disobey, the essence of Being, (second idea).

The Initiate wears a tiara. Two crowned men kneel at his feet, one
clothed in red, the other in black.

Here we find the *active* form of the symbolism expressed *in passive*
form by the second card. The same idea of Esoterism, of secret
Instruction, reappears; but the Tuition is now *practical and oral*, it
no longer requires a book (third idea),

As we see, this card is the complement of the second;

the same rule applies to all the cards, when the total of their number
makes 7. Thus--

The fifth card of the Tarot corresponds with the letter *he* of the
sacred word. It is the direct reflection of the 4th arcanum, and the
indirect reflection of the 2nd arcanum. It therefore signifies--

In the Divine. Reflex of the Will--

INTELLIGENCE

(characteristic of God the Son).

In the Human. Reflex of the Power--

AUTHORITY

(characteristic of the Woman).

Religion. Faith.

In Nature. Reflex of the Soul of the World, or of the Universal creative
fluid--

THE UNIVERSAL LIFE

(characteristic of *Natura naturata*).

Universal life is the negative part of the vivifying universal fluid.
Their reciprocal action will give rise to the *universal attraction* or
*universal Love* represented by the 6th arcanum.
