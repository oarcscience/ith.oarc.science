### CARD VIII.

# POWER.

In the midst of a green plain, surrounded by blue hills, I saw a woman
with a lion. Girdled with wreaths of roses, a symbol of infinity over
her head, the woman calmly and confidently covered the lion's mouth and
the lion obediently licked her hand.

"This is a picture of power", said the voice. "It has different
meanings. First it shows the power of love. Love alone can conquer
wrath. Hatred feeds hatred. Remember what Zarathustra said: "Let man be
freed from vengeance; this is a bridge for me which leads to higher hope
and a rainbow in heaven after long storms".

"Then it shows power of unity. These wreaths of roses suggest a magic
chain. Unity of desires, unity of aspirations creates such power that
every wild, uncontrolled, unconscious force is subdued. Even two
desires, if united, are able to conquer almost the whole world.

"The picture also shows the power of infinity, that sphere of mysteries.
For a consciousness that perceives the symbol of infinity above it,
knows no obstacles and cannot be withstood".
