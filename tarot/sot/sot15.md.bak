### CARD XVI.

# THE TOWER.

I saw a lofty tower extending from earth to heaven; its golden crowned
summit reached beyond the clouds. All round it black night reigned and
thunder rumbled.

Suddenly the heavens opened, a thunder-clap shook the whole earth, and
lightning struck the summit of the tower and felled the golden crown. A
tongue of fire shot from heaven and the whole tower became filled with
fire and smoke. Then I beheld the builders of the tower fall headlong to
the ground.

And the voice said:--

"The building of the tower was begun by the disciples of the great
Master in order to have a constant reminder of the Master's teaching
that the true tower must be built in one's own soul, that in the tower
built by hands there can be no mysteries, that no one can ascend to
Heaven by treading stone steps.

"The tower should warn the people *not to believe in it*. It should
serve as a reminder of the inner Temple and as a protection against the
outer; it should be as a lighthouse, in a dangerous place where men have
often been wrecked and where ships should not go.

"But by and by the disciples forgot the true covenant of the Master and
what the tower symbolized, and began *to believe in the tower* of stone,
they had built, and to teach others to so believe. They began to say
that in this tower there is power, mystery and the spirit of the Master,
that the tower itself is holy and that it is built for the coming Master
according to His covenant and His will. And so they waited in the tower
for the Master. Others did not believe this, or interpreted it
differently. Then began disputes about the rights of the summit.
Quarrels started, 'Our Master, your Master,' was said; 'our tower, your
tower.' And the disciples ceased to understand each other. Their tongues
had become confused.

"You understand the meaning here? They had begun to think that this is
the tower of the Master, that He builds it through them, and that it
must and, indeed, can be built right up to Heaven.

"And you see how Heaven responded?"
