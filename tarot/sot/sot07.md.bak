### CARD XX.

# JUDGMENT.

I saw an ice plain, and on the horizon, a chain of snowy mountains. A
cloud appeared and began to grow until it covered a quarter of the sky.
Two fiery wings suddenly expanded in the cloud, and I knew that I beheld
the messenger of the Empress.

He raised a trumpet and blew through it vibrant, powerful tones. The
plain quivered in response to him and the mountains loudly rolled their
echoes. One after another, graves opened in the plain and out of them
came men and women, old and young, and children. They stretched out
their arms toward the Messenger of the Empress and to
[catch](errata.htm#2.md) the sounds of his trumpet.

And in its tones I felt the smile of the Empress and in the opening
graves I saw the opening flowers whose fragrance seemed to be wafted by
the outstretched arms.

Then I understood the mystery of birth in death.
