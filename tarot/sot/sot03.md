### CARD 0.

# THE FOOL.

And I saw another man.

Tired and lame he dragged himself along the dusty road, across the
deserted plain under the scorching rays of the sun. He glanced sidelong
with foolish, staring eyes, a half smile, half leer on his face; he knew
not where he went, but was absorbed in his chimerical dreams which ran
constantly in the same circle. His fool's cap was put on wrong side
front, his garments were torn in the back; a wild lynx with glowing eyes
sprang upon him from behind a rock and buried her teeth in his flesh. He
stumbled, nearly fell, but continued to drag himself along, all the time
holding on his shoulder a bag containing useless things, which he, in
his stupidity, carried wherever he went.

Before him a crevice crossed the road and a deep precipice awaited the
foolish wanderer. Then a huge crocodile with open mouth crawled out of
the precipice. And I heard the voice say:--

"Look! This is the same man."

I felt my head whirl.

"What has he in the bag?" I inquired, not knowing

why I asked. And after a long silence the voice replied: "The four magic
symbols, the sceptre, the cup, the sword and the pentacle. The fool
always carries them, although he has long since forgotten what they
mean. Nevertheless they belong to him, even though he does not know
their use. The symbols have not lost their power, they retain it in
themselves.
