### CARD I.

# THE MAGICIAN.

I Saw the Man.

His figure reached from earth to heaven and was clad in a purple mantle.
He stood deep in foliage and flowers and his head, on which was the
head-band of an initiate, seemed to disappear mysteriously in infinity.

Before him on a cube-shaped altar were four symbols of magic--the
sceptre, the cup, the sword and the pentacle.

His right hand pointed to heaven, his left to earth. Under his mantle he
wore a white tunic girded with a serpent swallowing its tail.

His face was luminous and serene, and, when his eyes met mine, I felt
that he saw most intimate recesses of my soul. I saw myself reflected in
him as in a mirror and in his eyes I seemed to look upon myself.

And I heard a voice saying:

--"Look, this is the Great Magician!

With his hands he unites heaven and earth, and the four elements that
form the world are controlled by him.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

The four symbols before him are the four letters of the name of God, the
signs of the four elements, fire, water, air, earth."

I trembled before the depth of the mysteries A touched... The words I
heard seemed to be littered by the Great Magician himself, and it was as
though he spoke in me.

I was in deep trepidation and at moment I felt there was nothing, before
me except the blue sky; but within me a window opened through which I
could see unearthly things. and hear unearthly words.
