### CARD IV.

# THE EMPEROR.

After I learned the first three numbers I was given to understand the
Great Law of Four--the alpha and omega of all.

I saw the Emperor on a lofty stone throne, ornamented by four rams'
heads. On his forehead shone a golden helmet. His white beard fell over
a purple mantle. In one hand he held a sphere, the symbol of his
possession, and in the other, a sceptre in the form of an Egyptian
cross--the sign of his power over birth.

"I am The Great Law," the Emperor said. "I am the name of God. The four
letters of his name are in me and I am in all.

"I am in the four principles. I am in the four elements. I am in the
four seasons. I am in the four cardinal points. I am in the four signs
of the Tarot.

"I am the beginning; I am action; I am completion; I am the result.

"For him who knows how to see me there are no mysteries on earth.

"I am the great Pentacle.

"As the earth encloses in itself fire, water and air; as the fourth
letter of the Name encloses in itself the first three and becomes itself
the first, so my sceptre encloses the complete triangle and bears in
itself the seed of a new triangle.

"I am the Logos in the full aspect and the beginning of a new Logos."

And while the Emperor spoke, his helmet shone brighter and brighter, and
his golden armour gleamed beneath his mantle. I could not bear his glory
and I lowered my eyes.

When I tried to lift them again a vivid light of radiant fire was before
me, and I prostrated myself and made obeisance to the Fiery Word.
