### CARD XI.

# JUSTICE.

When I possessed the keys, read the book and understood the symbols, I
was permitted to lift the curtain of the Temple and enter. its inner
sanctum. And there I beheld a Woman with a crown of gold and a purple
mantle. She held a sword in one hand and scales in the other. I trembled
with awe at her appearance, which was deep and mysterious, and drew me
like an abyss.

"You see Truth," said the voice. "On these scales everything is weighed.
This sword is always raised to guard justice, and nothing can escape it.

"But why do you avert your eyes from the scales and the sword? They will
remove the last illusions. How could you live on earth without these
illusions?

"You wished to see Truth and now you behold it! But remember what
happens to the mortal who beholds a Goddess!"
