### CARD IX.

# THE HERMIT.

After long wanderings over a sandy, waterless desert where only serpents
lived, I met the Hermit.

He was wrapped in a long cloak, a hood thrown over his head. He held a
long staff in one hand and in the other a lighted lantern, though it was
broad daylight and the sun was shining.

"The lantern of Hermes Trismegistus", said the voice, "this is higher
knowledge, that inner knowledge which illuminates in a new way even what
appears to be already clearly known. This lantern lights up the past,
the present and the future for the Hermit, and opens the souls of people
and the most intimate recesses. of their hearts."

"The cloak of Apollonius is the faculty of the wise man by which he
isolates himself, even amidst a noisy crowd; it is his skill in hiding
his mysteries, even while expressing them, his capacity for silence and
his power to act in stillness.

"The staff of the patriarchs is his inner authority, his power, his
self-confidence."

The lantern, the cloak and the staff are the three symbols of
initiation. They are needed to guide souls past the temptation of
illusory fires by the roadside, so that they may go straight to the
higher goal. He who receives these three symbols or aspires to obtain
them, "strives to enrich himself with all he can acquire, not for
himself, but, like God, to delight in the joy of giving".

"The giving virtue is the basis of an initiate's life.

"His soul is transformed into 'a spoiler of all treasures' so said
Zarathustra.

"Initiation unites the human mind with the higher mind by a chain of
analogies. This chain is the ladder leading to heaven, dreamed of by the
patriarch".
