### CARD XV.

# THE DEVIL.

Black, awful night enveloped the earth. An ominous, red flame burned in
the distance. I was approaching a fantastic figure which outlined itself
before me as I came nearer to it. High above the earth appeared the
repulsive red face of the Devil, with large, hairy ears, pointed beard
and curved goats' horns. A pentagram, pointing downwards, shone in
phosphoric light between the horns on his forehead. Two large, grey,
bat-like wings were spread behind him. He held up one arm, spreading out
his bare, fat hand. In the palm I saw the sign of black magic. A burning
torch held down-end in his other hand emitted black, stifling smoke. He
sat on a large, black cube, gripping it with the claws of his
beast-like, shaggy legs.

A man and woman were chained to the cube--the same Man and Woman I saw
in the garden, but now they had horns and tails tipped with flame. And
they were evidently dissatisfied in spirit, and were filled with protest
and repulsion.

"This is a picture of weakness", said the voice, "a picture of falsehood
and evil. They are the same man and

woman you saw in the garden, but their love ceasing to be a sacrifice,
became an illusion. This man and woman forgot that their love is a link
in the chain that unites them with eternity, that their love is a symbol
of equilibrium and a road to Infinity.

"They forgot that It is a key to the gate of the magic world, *the torch
which lights the higher Path*. They forgot that Love is real and
immortal and they subjugated it to the unreal and temporary. And they
each made love a tool for submitting the other to himself.

"Then love became dissension and fettered them with iron chains to the
black cube of matter, on which sits deceit".

And I heard the voice of the Devil: "I am Evil", he said, "at least so
far as Evil can exist in this best of worlds. In order to see me, one
must be able to see unfairly, incorrectly and narrowly. I close the
triangle, the other two sides of which are Death and Time. In order to
quit this triangle it is necessary to see that it does not exist.

"But how to do this is not for me to tell. For I am the Evil which men
say is the cause of all evil and which they invented as an excuse for
all the evil that they do.

"They call me the Prince of Falsehood, and truly I am the prince of
lies, because I am the most monstrous production of human lies".
