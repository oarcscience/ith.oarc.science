### CARD XVIII.

# THE MOON.

A desolate plain stretched before me. A full moon looked down as if in
contemplative hesitation. Under her wavering light the shadows lived
their own peculiar life. On the horizon I saw blue hills, and over them
wound a path which stretched between two grey towers far away into the
distance. On either side the path a wolf and dog sat and howled at the
moon. I remembered that dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. A large
black crab crawled out of the rivulet into the sands. A heavy, cold dew
was falling.

Dread fell upon me. I sensed the presence of a mysterious world, a world
of hostile spirits, of corpses rising from graves, of wailing ghosts. In
this pale moonlight I seemed to feel the presence of apparitions;
someone watched me from behind the towers,--and I knew it was dangerous
to look back.
