### CARD VII.

# THE HIEROPHANT.

I saw the great Master in the Temple. He was siting on a golden throne
set upon a purple platform, and he wore the robe of a high priest with a
golden tiara. He held a golden eight-pointed cross, and lying at his
feet were two crossed keys. Two initiates bowed before him and to them
he spoke:--

"Seek the Path, do not seek attainment, Seek for the Path within
yourself.

"Do not expect to hear the truth from others, nor to see it, or read it
in books. Look for the truth in yourself, not without yourself.

"Aspire only after the impossible and inaccessible. *Expect only that
which shall not be*.

"Do not hope for Me,--do not look for Me,--do not believe--that I am
outside yourself.

"Within your soul build a lefty tower by which you may ascend to Heaven.
Do not believe in external miracles, expect miracles only within you.
Beware of believing in a mystery of the earth, in a mystery guarded by
men; for treasuries which must be guarded

are empty. Do not search for a mystery that can be hidden by men. Seek
the Mystery within yourself.

"Above all, avoid those towers built in order to preserve the mysteries
and to make an ascent to Heaven by stone stairways. And remember that as
soon as men build such a tower they begin to dispute about the summit.

"The Path is in yourself, and Truth is in yourself and Mystery is in
yourself."
