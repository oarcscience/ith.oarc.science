### CARD III.

# THE EMPRESS.

I felt the breath of the spring, and accompanying the fragrance of
violets and lilies-of-the-valley I heard the tender singing of elves.
Rivulets murmured, the treetops rustled, the grasses whispered,
innumerable birds sang in choruses and bees hummed; everywhere I felt
the breathing of joyful, living Nature.

The sun shone tenderly and softly and a little white cloud hung over the
woods.

In the midst of a green meadow where primroses bloomed, I saw the
Empress seated on a throne covered with ivy and lilacs. A green wreath
adorned her golden hair and, above her head, shone twelve stars. Behind
her rose two snowy wings and in her hands she held a sceptre. All
around, beneath the sweet smile of the Empress, flowers and buds opened
their dewy, green leaves. Her whole dress was covered with them as
though each newly opened flower were reflected in it or had engraved
itself thereon and thus become part of her garment.

The sign of Venus, the goddess of love, was chiselled on her marble
throne.

"Queen of life," I said, "why is it so bright and joyful all about you?
Do you not know of the grey, weary autumn, of the cold, white winter? Do
you not know of death and graveyards with black graves, damp and cold?
How can you smile so joyfully on the opening flowers, when everything is
destined to death, even that which has not yet been born?"

For answer the Empress looked on me still smiling and, under the
influence of that smile, I suddenly felt a flower of some clear
understanding open in my heart.
