### CARD XXI.

# THE WORLD.

An unexpected vision appeared to me. A circle not unlike a wreath woven
from rainbow and lightnings, whirled from heaven to earth with a
stupendous, velocity, blinding me by its brilliance. And amidst this
light and fire I heard music and soft singing, thunderclaps and the roar
of a tempest, the rumble of falling mountains and earthquakes.

The circle whirled with a terrifying noise, touching the sun and the
earth, and, in the centre of it I saw the naked, dancing figure of a
beautiful young woman, enveloped by a light, transparent scarf, in her
hand she held a magic wand.

Presently the four apocalyptical beasts began to appear on the edges of
the circle; one with the face of a lion, another with the face of a man,
the third, of an eagle and the fourth, of a bull.

The vision disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. A weird silence fell
on me. "What does it mean?" I asked in wonder.

"It is the image of the world," the voice said, "but it can be
understood only after the Temple has been

entered. This is a vision of the world in the circle of Time, amidst the
four principles. But thou seest differently because thou seest the world
outside thyself. Learn to see it in thyself and thou wilt understand the
infinite essence, hidden in all illusory forms. Understand that the
world which thou knowest is only one of the aspects of the infinite
world, and things and phenomena are merely hierolgyphics of deeper
ideas."
